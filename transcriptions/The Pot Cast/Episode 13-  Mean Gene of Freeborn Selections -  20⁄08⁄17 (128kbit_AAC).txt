[SPEAKER_02]: Hello and welcome to the next episode of
The Podcast, a cannabis podcast for
[SPEAKER_02]: budding enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: This episode, as always, was brought to
you by 420 Australia, your premier store
[SPEAKER_02]: for all things lifestyle and apparel,
organic gardening solutions for all your
[SPEAKER_02]: organic gardening needs, as well as
aficionado seeds and freeborn selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be on the lookout for the newest lines
from both.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this episode, we're lucky enough to
have Mean Gene from Mendocino on the show
[SPEAKER_02]: to chat all things breeding, strain
history, and some of his plans for the
[SPEAKER_02]: future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All righty, so a big, big, big thank you
to the man behind all the badass genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: you've seen at aficionado, Mean Gene of
Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for taking the time to sit
down and talk with us today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you for having me on,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first question I'd like to ask all
breeders is, what was your first
[SPEAKER_02]: experience with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, there's different,
there's layers to that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: My first experience with cannabis in
memory was actually being a really little
[SPEAKER_04]: kid and seeing cannabis growing at my
house, you know, when I was like two years
[SPEAKER_04]: old or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember, like 1982 or something,
my mom getting arrested for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The roommate had a, her roommate had an
argument with the landlord or something,
[SPEAKER_04]: the landlord called the cops.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, there's six plants on the back
porch or something like that, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as smoking, I'd say I was
probably about, I don't know, I was a kid,
[SPEAKER_04]: man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was probably like eight years old and I
had a buddy who always, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: he had older brothers and they always had
a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And whatever, they were totally,
house was full of crazy contraband of all
[SPEAKER_04]: types, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember, you know, them being
around and being like, oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke the joint, smoke the joint while I
was staying the night at my friend's
[SPEAKER_04]: house.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I took a couple hits off
the joint and I didn't feel anything,
[SPEAKER_04]: nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I probably didn't really,
it probably didn't go past my mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, you know, oh, okay,
cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this was nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I stayed away from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, a couple of few years
later, I smoked and I actually felt it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought, okay, this is what it was
like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think maybe I was 12 or 13 and
I was with my buddy, Jody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jody had this weed that he got from
this dude that lived in Napa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for whatever reason, that time I think
it was probably because of the way we
[SPEAKER_04]: smoked it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had like this little, it was like a
little bottle with a little down stem into
[SPEAKER_04]: it and a little tube that came back up out
of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was like a miniature bong or a
miniature chalice, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember I smoked that with him and
I remember telling him, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: this isn't weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something else in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that dude, he gave you,
he gave you weed that was laced.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, those guys out in Napa that
I don't know, man, they laced the weed and
[SPEAKER_04]: I was so gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember thinking, oh, I'm going to
be in trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: My mom's going to show up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, dude, it's like 1 30 in the
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, yeah, I know, man,
but I'm so high.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be in trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes, your mom, what time is your
mom getting you?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I don't know, like eight 30 or
nine.
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes, dude, no weed's going to get you
high for eight hours, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just have fun, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just remember being like,
honestly, like probably like half blacked
[SPEAKER_04]: out almost of being in and out of really
knowing what was going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember like running around in circles
by this pond.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the hog farm and just kind of like
falling down, chasing him through the
[SPEAKER_04]: water and the edge and just like,
you know, playing like kids do,
[SPEAKER_04]: but just high as a kite, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the first time I remember
getting really, like really going,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, so you can get this high off a weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before that, it was like, I thought I was
getting high, but I realized that I was
[SPEAKER_04]: just kind of, you know, dabbling and
tasting it and whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what strange you think that was?
[SPEAKER_04]: Geez, I don't know, man, but I wish I had
it now because it was killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I had smoked a lot of weed before
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before that, I had smoked Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd smoked different, like Afghanis and
different crosses of different stuff that
[SPEAKER_04]: was around, you know, like turn of the 90s
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably that first time I tried weed,
I was probably like 88, didn't really just
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of smoked it to not get made fun of,
you know, and then probably, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: later on, then smoking like really killer
weed, but not smoking it so much,
[SPEAKER_04]: but getting high.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, man, I smoked that weed from
Napa and whatever that weed was,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was some major stuff because I imagine
it was probably like Hash Plan or
[SPEAKER_04]: something really potent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just, it knocked me, you know,
and I didn't get that high again,
[SPEAKER_04]: even smoking for maybe another year or
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, then I, that was the first time
that I smoked a lot of Keef and that was
[SPEAKER_04]: the first, my first experience with a
concentrated smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that really got me too, but strain
wise, man, it'd be hard to, it'd be hard
[SPEAKER_04]: to say really what that would have been,
but some bomb, 1992, whatever the hell was
[SPEAKER_04]: there, you know, and nobody would,
would really know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back then you would have just said,
oh, this is, this is either, this is
[SPEAKER_04]: either good weed or bad weed, you know,
so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so from that point, how did you then
transition into growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it the type of thing where from these
experiences, it was just implanted in your
[SPEAKER_02]: mind, like I've got to do this,
or was it more of the type of thing where
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone around you was doing it so you
didn't even like make a conscious decision
[SPEAKER_02]: to start growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, it was just like, oh,
I just started doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it was going on and people who were
older than me, of course, everybody in the
[SPEAKER_04]: area was kind of growing, but at my age,
when I first started growing, it was more
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know, I used to work with the
family and, you know, like when I remember
[SPEAKER_04]: being a little kid and like transplanting
some pansies or like some little flowers
[SPEAKER_04]: for the yard and, you know, like supposed
to water the, water the trees in the front
[SPEAKER_04]: yard and half acid and, and then at a
certain point just being like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, I want to grow one of those plants,
you know, and they were like, all right,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, you, you know, here, this one's
yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is your baby plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead and, you know, put this stuff in
the dirt and stick this in and you're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to water it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you take care of it, you know,
you can have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, 10 years old, it was a
Northern lights plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was kind of, that was kind of my
introduction to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, I, I don't remember
growing any other plants until maybe I was
[SPEAKER_04]: probably like 14.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was 94.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I got some killer seeds and
I planted them and I grew them in a,
[SPEAKER_04]: in a, in a big garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just had my, my few little plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had like, whatever, 10 plants or eight
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that, the weed that came
off of that was, you know, that was like
[SPEAKER_04]: basically my second try.
[SPEAKER_04]: That, that weed was as good as anything
I've ever grown or still grow to this day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just a really good place to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was down in Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a really good place to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the knowledge that, you know,
you should use all nice organic stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of, you know, minimal handling,
slow cure, slow drying.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was, you know, I think anybody
who really ever tries it, the first time
[SPEAKER_04]: that they get some good weed in their
hands from trying it, they're going to go,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh God, I got to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to do this some more.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to learn more aspects of this,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what was the catalyst for your
first breeding project?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it accidental?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it intentional?
[SPEAKER_02]: And a question I haven't asked anyone so
far, did you start breeding because you
[SPEAKER_02]: were particularly inspired by someone or
just because you kind of wanted to just
[SPEAKER_02]: have a crack at it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'd say what happened was probably
that time, like 94, I got some strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them, there was an Afghani called
dirt that my buddy had.
[SPEAKER_04]: See money, he had this, he had this dirt
plant and it was this earthy Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they called it dirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it came from a crew of people who
were, who were big old school growers back
[SPEAKER_04]: in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this guy, Randy brought it back to the
Branscombe area, which is in Mendocino
[SPEAKER_04]: County.
[SPEAKER_04]: He brought that back in like 83 or 84.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he gave me some seeds that were
across, there was a dirt cross big bud and
[SPEAKER_04]: dirt cross a thing that they call perp out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so basically they were, they were
Afghani crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had those, I had some other different
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what happened, I think 95 or 96,
my buddy said, oh, I took that dirt perp
[SPEAKER_04]: and I crossed it with Mark's stuff from
down the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there was this guy named Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had really killer Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_04]: He called his stuff Mark's red,
cause it always had like more red hairs
[SPEAKER_04]: than most stuff, not more abundant,
but they were a more true red color.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he told me, hey, you know,
I got this dirt perp cross Mark's red.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he gave me those seeds and he only
gave me a few, maybe a six pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had already had the dirt perp,
grown them, cloned them, had a really good
[SPEAKER_04]: clone out of the dirt perp, had really
good clones out of the dirt big bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I said, well, you know,
I wish I would have kept the males when I
[SPEAKER_04]: cloned those plants before, you know,
a year or two ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So 97, I went ahead and I took those seeds
and I planted them in one pot and I let
[SPEAKER_04]: them grow up and they were just little
like knee high plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I let them do a little open
pollination and then I got those seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after growing those, you know,
I was hooked because I started off with
[SPEAKER_04]: this nice stuff and I wound up with a
bunch of seeds that were, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: just as good and a bigger number of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I found even better ones in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, then the first year that I
really got to grow those out in quantity,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think was probably two years later and I
grew out a bunch and I made a bunch more
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds and I made some different
out-crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was kind of, you know,
really the start and it wasn't the
[SPEAKER_04]: inspiration, I would say, kind of came
from those guys, like from Steve-O and
[SPEAKER_04]: C-Money and these guys who gave me the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I saw that, wow, okay, they gave me
these seeds and I got this and now I made
[SPEAKER_04]: these seeds and I got this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just made sense to keep making seeds
and try to do selections and improve and
[SPEAKER_04]: recombine and, you know, I had read High
Times since I was like 10 years old and I
[SPEAKER_04]: saw the stuff from the Cannabis Cups and,
you know, people with seed companies and
[SPEAKER_04]: it just all seemed really cool,
you know, to be able to like make your own
[SPEAKER_04]: types of weed and keep around good ones
that you already liked, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: have more seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, just fast forwarding to 2015
for a moment when you got your first place
[SPEAKER_02]: with Cherry Lime at the Emerald Cup,
what was that like, you know, to go from
[SPEAKER_02]: the guy reading the magazines to now being
the guy in the magazines taking the first
[SPEAKER_02]: place type thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it was a trip.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of surreal, you know,
like you think, okay, it was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: all right, 2006, my buddy enters a plant
that I gave him and he wins second place
[SPEAKER_04]: in the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: 2007, I go, okay, well, I got more stuff
from those same lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to grow some and enter it and
see if I can do okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next year, there's almost twice as
many entries and I still did sixth place
[SPEAKER_04]: and so I was pretty excited about that and
then that was 2007 and so then,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the next year hit and in autumn
that year, one of my really good friends
[SPEAKER_04]: passed away and it set me back like I was
like not in the mind state of going,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, well, I'm going to go ahead and get
this and get these entries together and do
[SPEAKER_04]: this stuff and so I just kind of stopped
doing it and then 2012, I went up and I
[SPEAKER_04]: entered some stuff and I kind of,
my entries weren't entered right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I entered big chunks of weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had to pop them apart for the judges
so the judges didn't get to see my trim
[SPEAKER_04]: job or anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have done good or, you know,
I might have still not placed but I didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: do anything that year so then the next
year I go up, I kind of have some more
[SPEAKER_04]: ideas like, okay, the judges only get two
grams so only enter two gram pieces or
[SPEAKER_04]: they're going to pop your stuff apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want it trimmed really, really tight
which I think usually makes really pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: weed kind of featureless so I don't
usually, I like to show the features a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit so I realized, okay,
well, they don't care about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just going to take it,
crunch it up and they're not going to pull
[SPEAKER_04]: out leaves or stems.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just going to crunch it up and
smoke it so I better make it like as close
[SPEAKER_04]: to a good, you know, ready for smoking as
possible and so, you know, I improved it
[SPEAKER_04]: in that way and then I took third and then
the next year I entered again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took second and then, you know,
when I won, I took first so it was kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: weird to me because it was like,
alright, I did third.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did second.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went, well, it would be, you know,
it's not realistic to think I'm going to
[SPEAKER_04]: do third, second and then first so when I
won first, I just kind of was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay and I mean, you can look at the video
and look it up and you can see when I'm up
[SPEAKER_04]: there, I'm like, hey, okay, I just won the
Emerald Cup so, alright.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even know what to do really.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a weird, surreal thing and I
remember it didn't really soak in until,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, that night we went and we went
to this pizza spot in Santa Rosa and we
[SPEAKER_04]: ordered food and we're eating the food and
I'm like, hey, guys, this is a victory
[SPEAKER_04]: dinner right here, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just won the cup right here,
you know, sitting with my family and,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, we all kind of laughed and I
was, you know, I was, we were,
[SPEAKER_04]: we, the Emerald Cup was Saturday and
Sunday and Monday morning we were going on
[SPEAKER_04]: vacation, the first family vacation I took
my family on so, you know, the whole thing
[SPEAKER_04]: was just kind of this crazy like,
hey, that happened and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you kind of expected to have like an
impact when it happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, hey, you just won and it kind of,
it was like I won and I grabbed my cup and
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really even realize that I had
won until dinner sitting there,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a trip, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really trippy because honestly up
until like 2013 I really didn't know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I had never been to any other
cup except the Emerald Cup which was kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of a little local thing and I'd never been
to a High Times Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd never met any other people who were
like breeders who were on the scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of people over the years who
always made their own seeds and worked
[SPEAKER_04]: lines and stuff but I didn't know anybody
with a company.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't, I had never seen any of that
whole scene that was going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know about the forums.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know people were on Facebook and
Instagram posting weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even really know Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought Instagram, oh, it's just some
place people put up pictures of their food
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after that, you know,
once I kind of started seeing it when I
[SPEAKER_04]: went on social media, it totally changed
so to all of a sudden go from being
[SPEAKER_04]: completely in the dark and not know any of
the stuff is going on and then all of a
[SPEAKER_04]: sudden be like, hey, I just won like one
of the big contests, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really, it blew me away.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a trip, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a trippy experience for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, without doubt and certainly
deserving.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we just take a bit of a wind back for a
moment, how did you make that progression
[SPEAKER_02]: from, you know, you said you were making
your own seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had friends doing really well with
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you progress from that point to
being, you know, the head breeder at
[SPEAKER_02]: aficionado seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, what happened was I got a
hold of Leo and Ellie and they were the
[SPEAKER_04]: people who built aficionado.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, hey, you know, I want to get
some seeds from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was this party going on at this
place up here called the Peg House.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Peg House is like a cool place,
you know, like really cool vibes up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, hey, if you guys are going
and they're like, yeah, actually we were
[SPEAKER_04]: going to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I go, hey, cool, cool, cool incident.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I'll meet you guys up there
and I'll, you know, I'll, I'll,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll smoke you guys out and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I brought up some cherry limeade and
they saw the cherry limeade and they're
[SPEAKER_04]: like, dude, did you enter this last year?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause they had won that year, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, no, I, I, I actually
haven't seen it till now.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was, it was a 420 party.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was, you know, 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I go, no, I just, I just went and
took this out.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was hanging up in the drying room.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't tried, even tried it yet,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they go, dude, they go, if you would
have entered this, you would have blown us
[SPEAKER_04]: out of the water.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, oh, you guys think so?
[SPEAKER_04]: I go, I entered the mother of it,
but it's not that potent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this one is crossed with the black
lime.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it might have some potency to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, so we smoked it and they
were like, dude, that's, that's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's the baddest weed there is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we never seen nothing like this
before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, damn, maybe, you know, maybe I'll
enter because I had kind of come,
[SPEAKER_04]: I had honestly gone like, oh, you know,
I'm not going to bother.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I'm not just going to give people
weed form to tell me that it's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I already know the weeds good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not into this whole contest thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when they said though, that it was
that much better than the winner,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, well, all right, well I'll
enter this next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, you know, so next year I entered
it and I got, that's when I took third
[SPEAKER_04]: place with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so basically, you know, I showed them
different stuff I was working with and I
[SPEAKER_04]: saw different stuff they were working with
and they were like, Hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: do you want to, do you want to do some
projects together?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, they, they,
they lived like four houses away from me
[SPEAKER_04]: at that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I was like, yeah, you know,
I go, I go, you know, let me, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: show me some more stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: They go, you know, and so Leo drops by one
day and he goes, Hey, this is the rest of
[SPEAKER_04]: the winner.
[SPEAKER_04]: That won the, the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I looked at it and I went,
wow, dude, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that looks a lot like what I call
lime one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my, my, my favorite black lime
clone that I keep around.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a PK cross black lime.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I go, you know, we should do that
cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he goes, I go, you know,
do you have a mail of that?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's proven that you like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes, yeah, I got the pollen right
now coming out of the tent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go, well, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's, let's go ahead and do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring it by and I'll make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got stuff going into flower pretty soon,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I went ahead and I did the lime one
crossed with the, with the chem that he
[SPEAKER_04]: had.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what black lime reserve is,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I did that one and I were,
I did a couple more crosses with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just, you know, that just kind
of, that just kind of worked out to,
[SPEAKER_04]: to be that stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it was just kind of a, it was kind
of a trippy, just a, just a weird luck
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of, you know, like, Hey, I want some
of your seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, Hey, you know,
your seeds are, your seeds are really
[SPEAKER_04]: good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to, you want to do some stuff and
that's, you know, that's how it happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just real organically like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It certainly sounds like some of the best
collaborations do happen on that real
[SPEAKER_02]: organic side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question I'm interested in is a lot of
breeders or, you know, companies will
[SPEAKER_02]: generally describe their work as a certain
style, you know, like maybe someone would
[SPEAKER_02]: say, Oh, I tend to do like one parent will
be old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: One will be new school, you know,
like kind of the merging of the flavors or
[SPEAKER_02]: someone else might be like, Oh,
I just do two new school things.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you describe aficionados work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it follows a general style or
not particularly?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, you know, it's, it's the
positioning on aficionado is basically
[SPEAKER_04]: like, all right, this is, this is the best
stuff there is.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the stuff that, you know,
growers who are experienced want to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: this to get stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's basically the highest end product,
you know, not necessarily, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's some people who are like,
Oh, these are the monster.
[SPEAKER_04]: This grows the monster stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every plant's going to be huge and heavy
or this grows that or aficionado,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say it's really aimed at being
something that's quality so that you can
[SPEAKER_04]: say, okay, this is, this is craft
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is boutique quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I'd say really that,
that is the style that it's, that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of shooting towards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also with like a little bit of
embedded heritage stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why Leo works with a lot of
stuff like from Mandelbrot because
[SPEAKER_04]: Mandelbrot at this point is, is kind of
like a more of an old school staple
[SPEAKER_04]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, like Royal Kush is
something that people who are from around
[SPEAKER_04]: here, they're like, Oh yeah, I've been
buying Royal for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had Royal for years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been growing that stuff for years
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a lot of the old school growers I
know have converted over to old stuff like
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, by kind of infusing that
going, okay, well here's something a
[SPEAKER_04]: Mandelbrot's but then it's crossed with
something that's more new, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's then it's more like, it's not,
I wouldn't say Mandelbrot's like a real
[SPEAKER_04]: old school, old school breeder,
but time flies so fast to the point now
[SPEAKER_04]: where Royal Kush is kind of like an old
school Emerald Triangle staple strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, like some of the,
some of the chem stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like, yeah, it's been around for a
while.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, that's kind of the whole,
the whole aim of aficionado I think is
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of to say, okay, here's stuff that's
really high end.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the stuff that's really good in
your joint, in your bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has, you know, some history to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, like I'd say that's kind of,
that's kind of the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's, you know, for me,
like as a breeder personally, like my
[SPEAKER_04]: whole thing really has always been,
okay, I want a better plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I want to grow, you know,
I've honestly over the years, I've kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: slipped from being a proper
preservationist in that I tried to always
[SPEAKER_04]: go, okay, what's the best, what's the best
possible thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had like some Afghanis, they're too
short, they get mold too easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I cross them with this, I cross them
with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I have this strain and now I don't
even have that Afghani anymore in some
[SPEAKER_04]: cases.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, it's all like improvement and
trying to have a plant that I really want
[SPEAKER_04]: to grow and that when I show it to people
who are other growers who I know,
[SPEAKER_04]: they really want to grow that,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, that's like the basis of my
work pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I mean, if we just touch on one of
the points you made, that heirloom slash
[SPEAKER_02]: land race type stuff does pop up
reasonably frequently in aficionados,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the line in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing which jumped to mind to me is
how do you source these types of genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're not, it's certainly not easy
type of stuff to source, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like Highland Afghani,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to imagine that would be some of
the hardest type of stock to try to
[SPEAKER_02]: acquire, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like I mean, as far as like Highland
Afghani, that's like, that's something
[SPEAKER_04]: that Mandelbrot got, I think from Salmon
Creek around 2003 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know the exact story on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, a lot of like a lot of what
aficionados stuff is, is like stuff that
[SPEAKER_04]: comes from Mandelbrot or that comes from
Shiloh or that comes from me, like guys
[SPEAKER_04]: who have been here for a long time or like
the family vault purple that comes from a
[SPEAKER_04]: guy named Larry who actually passed this
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a great dude, a hippie Larry or
crazy Larry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, it's just a matter of
people who have these things and who have
[SPEAKER_04]: kept them because they liked stuff enough
to not just switch over to commercial
[SPEAKER_04]: mainstream clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you kind of have, you kind of
have, of course, there's a million kinds
[SPEAKER_04]: of growers, but you have kind of two major
subgroups in this area.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have people who either grow all diesel
and blue dream and they bust out units and
[SPEAKER_04]: they make money or you have people like,
there's people like me who take a big hit
[SPEAKER_04]: on money because it's like, okay,
I want to grow everything from seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the last time I grew a clone in my
garden to actually grow weed from it and
[SPEAKER_04]: not just to seed it for fun was probably
10 years ago, you know, and in between
[SPEAKER_04]: then and way back before that,
there was probably only maybe one or two
[SPEAKER_04]: seasons where I ever really, you know,
produced clones to say, okay, I have this
[SPEAKER_04]: weed and it's all comes from this one
clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I sacrifice, you know, basically like
ease of manufacture.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't just go, okay, I'm going to grow
all this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So somebody wants all OG, I got all OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, no, I got a plan of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a plan of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a plan of this, you know,
they're all different because they're from
[SPEAKER_04]: seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even if your stuff is completely
consistent, as far as like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like if you have like, you know,
quote unquote IBL stock, it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you're still, people are still
probably not going to take those plants
[SPEAKER_04]: and mix them in the bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they do, people might go,
yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I smoked one joint out of that
bag and it looked the same as this other
[SPEAKER_04]: joint, but the one joint got me a little
higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one joint was a little tastier.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still these fine variations
anytime you come from seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't ever get to the point where
it's a hundred percent consistent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, people don't like that in
commercial stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the main thing is with sourcing
genetics is you have to track down the
[SPEAKER_04]: other set of people like me who actually
want to grow from seed so they still have
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because most people are like, I don't need
seeds, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just go buy OG clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just go buy cookies clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever's the flavor of the week,
I'm going to go buy that and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_04]: bust it out and kill it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all I want.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to mess around with having a
bunch of different stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you really have a love for like
different genetics and stuff, then that's
[SPEAKER_04]: when you're going to be one of those
people who says, no, I actually have,
[SPEAKER_04]: I have stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I have strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have old seed strains and they are
unique because they were bred by people
[SPEAKER_04]: who were isolated for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, that's how I have stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where all that kind of special
stuff comes from when people have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, then there's people
who preserve things through cloning,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is awesome too, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Also really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's definitely not quite as good as
having an open pollinated population of
[SPEAKER_04]: plants that come from that gene pool
instead of just one select clone that's
[SPEAKER_04]: been around, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you kind of almost hinted at this
idea I've been interested in in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think there's any value or maybe a
better way to phrase it is would you ever
[SPEAKER_02]: consider doing a breeding cycle whereby
the mother and the father were from the
[SPEAKER_02]: same stockage cycle, but you know,
like you would be doing it from seed every
[SPEAKER_02]: time so that each batch was kind of a
little bit unique within its own right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, that's really interesting
that you said that because I kind of have
[SPEAKER_04]: a concept that I'm working on and I want
to see how well it flies.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how people have grown weed for
thousands of years at the very least,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of these like these people say,
oh, there's all this improvement.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, yeah, there's there's
improvement.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm sure there's been points in
history when people had, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: reached a point that was similar to this
or in certain areas, people have a
[SPEAKER_04]: particular type that's a certain,
you know, up to the standards of today,
[SPEAKER_04]: because, you know, the way genetics work
is those traits have to exist in the
[SPEAKER_04]: original stock in order to be able to lock
them down.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe the old seeds weren't as
consistent, but they still had all the
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff we love in them today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like people are crazy over cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I smell cookies, it's I'm like,
oh, this is like a Hindu Kush and the
[SPEAKER_04]: resin is a little bit more waxy as opposed
to being a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the Hindu Kush might have a
little more dry feel to the resin or,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like all the things that are hot
today, I see those traits and they just
[SPEAKER_04]: look like old stuff I saw from hippies
weed from back when I was a kid and when I
[SPEAKER_04]: was a teenager.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, I always grow from seed that I
make basically over the years maybe it's
[SPEAKER_04]: not last year seed, maybe it's seed from
five or 10 years ago or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I always grow seed that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and I really like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm kind of interested in maybe
starting to put out seed in that way where
[SPEAKER_04]: I say, okay, this is cherry limeade
numbers one through 20 from 2017.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the keepers out of, you know,
run a big population and go, okay,
[SPEAKER_04]: here's the females that I like the very
best.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was 12 of them, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are really stand out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then be able to release the seeds and
say, okay, here's cherry limeade.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the F5s that I made from this
line from this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's like people get a window
into the way that people actually used to
[SPEAKER_04]: grow weed and get seeds because everyone's
into clones now or they're into getting a
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding that came from cloned parents.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have appreciation for like all of
those different ways to do stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're all really good tools,
but at the same time it's trippy because I
[SPEAKER_04]: don't see any companies who are putting
out seeds that are made the way that weed
[SPEAKER_04]: growers have been growing for,
you know, all of history.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, when you said that it's trippy
because it's something that I've really
[SPEAKER_04]: been playing with going, okay,
yeah, I'm going to put out, this is going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be the 2000 batch, one through 10 of
this strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people who get that, they get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't get it, then you got to
get the 2008.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to get the 2019.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all a little different,
but different lines will come out that
[SPEAKER_04]: way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that way, instead of providing the
public with a really narrow snapshot of
[SPEAKER_04]: the genetics that are in a gene pool,
they actually get access to the whole gene
[SPEAKER_04]: pool in all these different little ways so
that somebody can go, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, I made knockoffs of this strain,
but you know, it turns out their knockoffs
[SPEAKER_04]: are this cool new novel thing that they
wouldn't have gotten if I just take Lyme
[SPEAKER_04]: number one and Lyme male number one,
and I just put out seeds like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're only going to get this
little window into the gene pool that way,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I mean, I'm just thinking,
I think the last breeder who I can think
[SPEAKER_02]: of who actually did that was Tom Hill when
he did like the deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of open pollination,
wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as I know, Tom Hill, when he did
deep chunk, yeah, he just did open
[SPEAKER_04]: pollination with that, and you know,
that's one that had been bottlenecked so
[SPEAKER_04]: much that it's one of the more consistent
strains I've seen from seed, but even in
[SPEAKER_04]: that, you know, there's ones that are
really hard and chunky, and there's ones
[SPEAKER_04]: that are really leafy and loose,
and there's ones that are green,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's ones that are purple, there's ones
that are sweet and earthy, and then
[SPEAKER_04]: there's ones that have the really like the
magic coffee, Hindu Kush smell,
[SPEAKER_04]: where like when you smoke it, it smells
like magic from a mile away, and those
[SPEAKER_04]: ones are really rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in those breedings, but when I
first saw deep chunk, I think he released
[SPEAKER_04]: that 2004 as deep chunk, but in like 2000,
I saw it as monkey balls in Spyrock,
[SPEAKER_04]: and in those earlier ones before the
release, I smelled a little bit more of
[SPEAKER_04]: that old, like what I call magic purple
indica that's just this old Afghani where
[SPEAKER_04]: when you burn it, it smells more like a
really good true old school haze,
[SPEAKER_04]: or it's got that spicy, incense-y,
funky, like just really special stuff to
[SPEAKER_04]: it, you know, but I think those were when
he did that was just to open pollination,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then he probably, I don't know if he
mixed the females or if he just took his
[SPEAKER_04]: favorite female and it had mixed males,
and he only released them from one female,
[SPEAKER_04]: or he took all the seeds from a bunch of
females and put those in packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really sure, you know,
what he did with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's interesting because,
I mean, a lot of his lines are just open
[SPEAKER_02]: pollination of stuff he's had earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever delved into any of the other
lines?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that the, you know, his haze often
got a good rap, but the ones I'm more
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in were the ones people seem to
have been less known about, like X18 I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: really interested in, no one seems to have
really run it too much, or Pintar Kush,
[SPEAKER_02]: another one like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the Pintar Kush we used to see,
back in the day, people used to get it
[SPEAKER_04]: from his family, you know, I went to
school with some of his family,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so his stuff would pop up like when I
was in high school, and they just called
[SPEAKER_04]: it the pine, and my buddy Seamoney
remembers it more clear than I do,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really remember it, I just know
that it's dank, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like he says it was super good,
and, you know, like first of all,
[SPEAKER_04]: for me, back in those days, all the weed
was so good that it was just kind of like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, this guy's got this, and this guy's
got that, not that much stuff really
[SPEAKER_04]: stands out unless I was the one who grew
it, kind of, for me, but the X18 is
[SPEAKER_04]: another one I haven't personally seen,
but Aaron from DNA said that that really
[SPEAKER_04]: blows the deep chunk out of the water,
that it's just a way better plant with way
[SPEAKER_04]: better weed, and so that makes it
interesting to me because, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: deep chunk's one of these ones with crazy
mixed reviews, because it's such pure
[SPEAKER_04]: stock that people really love that aspect,
but at the same time, most people don't
[SPEAKER_04]: really like to smoke it, because they
usually only get a few seeds, and then
[SPEAKER_04]: they started with a pack and they made
some, so they didn't ever see like the
[SPEAKER_04]: older, when it was really, the line was
really more opened up, and so they haven't
[SPEAKER_04]: seen those special, like, there's ones in
it that are more like a Master Kush or a
[SPEAKER_04]: Hindu, I mean, it is Hindu Kush,
but it's more of that, like, classic funk
[SPEAKER_04]: to it, so when someone tells me that X18
is way better, you know, and I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: Aaron sees a ton of weed, too,
so I figure, you know, that the X18 must
[SPEAKER_04]: be killer, and then there was one,
I had a buddy who I used to work for,
[SPEAKER_04]: and he had this stuff, and I was like,
dude, what is this?
[SPEAKER_04]: This stuff's incredible, and he was like,
oh, you like that one?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, yeah, dude, what could you
not like?
[SPEAKER_04]: It has buds as big as my arm.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're basically black and silver,
because the weed is so purple and the
[SPEAKER_04]: resin is so silvery white on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells like spray paint and ammonia and
skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just amazing, and, you know,
I was told that that was probably the
[SPEAKER_04]: North Indian, but then when I talked to
another buddy, he said, ah, the North
[SPEAKER_04]: Indian's not really like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not quite so big.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I saw Bodhi run out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I only saw, like, maybe one picture or
something, but it didn't really look like
[SPEAKER_04]: what I saw, so anyway, Tom Hill's dad,
when I asked, well, what is this stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, my buddy said, oh, this is Tom
Hill's dad's stuff, you know, because,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, Tom Hill was his buddy,
and he had just given him a bunch of seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: and said, oh, this is my dad's strain,
you know, and, you know, everything that
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom Hill has, as far as I know,
comes from, you know, from his dad and
[SPEAKER_04]: those guys that had worked with it over
the years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, to me, that was the one that,
for me, is one of my holy grail strains,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I still can't really figure out 100%
what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be the North Indian.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe if I can finagle some seeds from
Bodhi at some point and try some out,
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see if I see that one popping out
and maybe lean it back if it is it,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I'm not really positive, you know,
and, unfortunately, to ask, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: to ask around to try to sort it back out,
I'm sure Tom Hill would say, my dad has
[SPEAKER_04]: lots of strains, and I'm sure my buddy
would go, yeah, I don't know, it's Tom
[SPEAKER_04]: Hill's dad's stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the stuff from chemists,
you know, so that one, to me, was
[SPEAKER_04]: incredible, so if, by any chance,
someone ever tells you, I have this stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: from Tom Hill, and it gets these big,
huge black and silver buds that smell like
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk and spray paint and ammonia,
definitely, you know, like, if you gotta
[SPEAKER_04]: buy them or you gotta trade or you gotta,
fly somewhere to get them, get those
[SPEAKER_04]: suckers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those things are, that was a really,
really incredible line, and to me,
[SPEAKER_04]: that was the one that I saw from Tom Hill
that was incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't know if he ever released it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, for all I know, it's X-18.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I've never seen X-18.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember the pine, I don't
remember the pine tar cush really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just remember it was stony, and it
smelled a lot like a pine tree,
[SPEAKER_04]: like cuttin' pine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all I really know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some, I have some haze that I got
from Backyard Farmer at South Fork Seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some deep chunk cross haze F2s,
and those probably have some really neat
[SPEAKER_04]: plants in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: My buddy at Roundtable Selections,
he grew out some of them, and he got some
[SPEAKER_04]: incredible plants that looked really neat,
like a deep chunk, but very narrow leaf,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is kinda like the Achilles heel of
deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool to look at, but it lets in no
light, and it causes it to really only get
[SPEAKER_04]: little buds on the outside, whereas the
monkey haze, as it's called, it gets,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it lets the light in,
so it gets these long buds, but they still
[SPEAKER_04]: get the deep chunk color, and you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's a neat one, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, wow, so many points you just hit on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm a little Tom Hill fanboy,
so I just, I need to clarify something
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the chemist Tom Hill's dad?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha, all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard he might be hanging out in
Southeast Asia somewhere, still kicking
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah, I mean, I would imagine,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't, you know, I don't,
all I know is I was working with my buddy,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I said, oh, what is this?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, that's Tom Hill's,
that's Tom Hill's dad stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's, and at this point, I didn't know who
Tom Hill was until maybe two years ago or
[SPEAKER_04]: something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just knew him as the guy who was my
buddy's friend who gave him these killer
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, I said, what is this?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, oh, this is Tom Hill's dad
stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, scientific with his
breeding, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like a scientist, and I remembered it
for years as him being called scientist.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it turned out I was talking to some,
I was talking to, I was talking to a
[SPEAKER_04]: backyard farmer, and he goes, no,
no, his name's chemist.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I went, that's right, chemist.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's what my buddy said.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, this guy's like a scientist
with his breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: He knows all the tricks.
[SPEAKER_04]: He knows all the ins and outs.
[SPEAKER_04]: His strains are true breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, that's how I know, you know,
who he is and stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just as a little side note quickly,
I've grown out probably like close to 40
[SPEAKER_02]: deep chunk females from this stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had probably falls exactly into the
category you described, but only one of
[SPEAKER_02]: those was like kind of as you described
that magic Hindu thing, and haven't been
[SPEAKER_02]: able to find it since.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't clone it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's neat, though, when you get it,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like coffee and earth and a little
bit of like interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting because, you know,
quote unquote, Indica's, her, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: broadleafs, they kind of get lumped into
this category of being very kind of bland
[SPEAKER_04]: on the high.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've had some over the years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to have this Indica called Big
Blue, which I think is a different line
[SPEAKER_04]: from the same import as the deep chunk
because it's pretty much the same plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I grow a big population of deep
chunk, I get ones that have the same form.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the one that's like as hard as a rock
and it has the extra flavor and it gets
[SPEAKER_04]: the extra purple on the leaves and down
all the way through the veins of the
[SPEAKER_04]: leaves where it's usually white.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very like psychedelic and laughy and
giggly and cerebral.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you would never think it from looking
at this plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the definition of a boring broadleaf
high when you look at the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you smoke it, it lays people on
the ground with the giggles for hours,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got given some seeds from a friend and
all he told me was that they were
[SPEAKER_02]: supposedly from an unreleased Tom Hill
line called the Blue Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so maybe it's something to do with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to get them going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You haven't tried them, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they large seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've got about six or seven of
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to get them going today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they look like they're big,
muscle-bound, look like a piece of rock
[SPEAKER_04]: and they're really big or are they little
seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're reasonably big, but I know what
you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen the real, real big Afghani ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not that, but they aren't small
ones by any means.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's interesting too, because I
generalize like, oh, that's what big blue
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the deep chunk as well, like Bodhi
gave me some of his deep chunk seeds that
[SPEAKER_04]: he made.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was stoked on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was stoked in another way because
they are small seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of the ones that I do from my old
stock that came from a friend of Tom
[SPEAKER_04]: Hill's before the release, they always
have really, really big seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that made me know, okay, well,
this might be a little bit different of a
[SPEAKER_04]: leg of that line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that the size of the seed is
entirely dependent on the genetics or do
[SPEAKER_02]: you think it also has some part to do with
when the pollination occurs in the general
[SPEAKER_02]: timeframe of the plant's life cycle?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I would say that when you start with
the pollination where you're in very early
[SPEAKER_04]: flower and you just have kind of the
primordia of the flower is there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just have those first hairs are
showing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get fewer seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be healthier.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have a thicker shell.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll probably have a higher female ratio
from them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll take longer to germinate,
but you'll get a better germination ratio
[SPEAKER_04]: and they'll store longer, better.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you make, if you take the same
strain and you seed it a little bit later,
[SPEAKER_04]: you'll get a lot more seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll still be fully viable and the
genetics will still all be of course
[SPEAKER_04]: intact and good, but you'll have small
smaller seeds with thinner shells.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a trade off there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to get a lot of people
producing seeds for money who are going to
[SPEAKER_04]: want to seed them really, really early.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to seed stuff when you can barely
tell it's flowering, just when it starts
[SPEAKER_04]: to get enough to get so you know you're
going to get some seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I basically get really close to
100% just perfect flawless seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never get the wonky ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a lot less twins.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a lot more of the seeds are a lot
more symmetrical.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so there's definitely something
to be said for that, but you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're never going to make, you're never
going to take like, you're never going to
[SPEAKER_04]: take these certain strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you're not, I like blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, you're never going to make
seeds on a blue dream plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you make it right when it first
buds and you juice the hell out of it and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's in full sun and it's the most happy
plan ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you leave it until the buds almost
nearly dead and the seeds are as good as
[SPEAKER_04]: could be.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll never get as big as a well
produced deep chunk seed from the,
[SPEAKER_04]: or big blue, you know, like from these
really crazy Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_04]: They, they get, they just genetically,
they get these really, really big seeds,
[SPEAKER_04]: but like Bodhi seeds are always great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these seeds he gave me were beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's what makes me think that
they're genetically leaning a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: to a different side in the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's definitely like a correlation
there, certain, you know, like a certain
[SPEAKER_04]: variety has a certain range of seed size.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like some just can't get as big as those
suckers get huge, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those things are like little nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we just loop back to a topic we were
talking about a while ago, you were
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about how, you know, broadly
speaking, there's two types of growers in
[SPEAKER_02]: California, the seed growers or the clone
growers, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause this idea seems to be coming up more
and more, especially in terms of how
[SPEAKER_02]: advantageous seeds can be compared to
clones, specifically in the outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the idea of having the taproot,
you know, that's really advantageous.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one major argument I've had against
this though, is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: not every seed is going to yield a product
as good as what an elite clone would.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is, do you feel that
through strict and high quality breeding,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can, with reasonable certainty,
offer a seed that is going to produce on
[SPEAKER_02]: average, quite a high quality product?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a lot of it comes down to
taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what happens is you might have a gene
pool that can consistently do,
[SPEAKER_04]: it can consistently recreate these plants
with potency, with yields, with this,
[SPEAKER_04]: with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times it comes down to a slight
variation in anything makes people get
[SPEAKER_04]: turned off to it based on taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you might have 10 female plants and you
clone them all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have a bunch of people who think
the number three is the greatest weed
[SPEAKER_04]: ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have a bunch of people who
think that the number nine is the greatest
[SPEAKER_04]: weed ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's some people, and you have
somebody who loves every plant that comes
[SPEAKER_04]: out of those seeds once they're bred
really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's certain plants that are just
more pleasing to, they're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're like pop, you know, they're pop
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like pop music, you know,
or pop art.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, this is what people,
people just like these.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can sell this weed at Walmart.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can sell this weed at Tiffany's,
you know, like it doesn't matter who you
[SPEAKER_04]: are, you're going to like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course there's always some people
who don't like it, but generally if people
[SPEAKER_04]: like strong weed, they're going to think
OG is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they like strong weed, they're going to
think chem is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if they like those more indica kind of
highs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think like a lot of it comes down to
not so much are the plants, can you create
[SPEAKER_04]: plants that are all quality?
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like, then you have to lock them
down to be this particular thing,
[SPEAKER_04]: in which case you kind of, you're going to
kind of alienate the people who might've
[SPEAKER_04]: liked the other thing that you didn't lock
down, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do believe you can make a strain
where everything is really high quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I grow my stuff that comes from my
black lime crosses and I don't ever really
[SPEAKER_04]: get a plant from them that I go,
eh, I don't like this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I like them all.
[SPEAKER_04]: If people have never seen something from
the line that they're attached to,
[SPEAKER_04]: the first time they see any given plant,
they go, whoa, that's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: But once they've grown attached to one
type, then they'll start to see some of
[SPEAKER_04]: the other ones and go, yeah, I don't like
that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's because they like, because of the
one that they do like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it kind of turns them off to the other
ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I think a lot of it comes
down to just your taste, what you like,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then, of course, you know,
bottlenecking out the stuff that just
[SPEAKER_04]: nobody thinks is going to be quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what I've spent years doing is
trying to get rid of the stuff that
[SPEAKER_04]: nobody's going to like and try to keep in
the stuff that I know somebody's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: love, even though I know, you know,
you can't please everybody with every
[SPEAKER_04]: single plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So an idea I've been thinking about a lot
recently is, do you think it's possible to
[SPEAKER_02]: selectively breed for either one trait,
like either breeding it in or out?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess what I mean by this is,
let's just say you had a clone or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a strain in general,
and you love everything about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just one trait specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's, for example, say maybe,
you know, um, resistance to insects or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, do you think you can breed that out
and breed it out in such a way that you
[SPEAKER_02]: only get rid of that one trait?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think you're always going to
lose some peripheral aspects that will be
[SPEAKER_02]: related to the genes involved in that
trait?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, maybe more specifically,
if you, if you could actually do it,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you think it would just take a
ridiculous number of generations to
[SPEAKER_02]: achieve the goal I kind of outlined?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think you could do it in a
reasonable number of generations?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, it's an interesting thing
because it's really like, uh, the perfect
[SPEAKER_04]: question for like, why would you want to
hyperdise something?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you already have something
good, why would you want to screw it up by
[SPEAKER_04]: adding something else?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think like in the case you said of
like, uh, insect resistance, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: for the, there's two, it's like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a gene pool and there's
already plants in it that are exactly what
[SPEAKER_04]: you want, except they are very insect
resistant and you don't have to go outside
[SPEAKER_04]: of the gene pool, then that's a case when
line breeding, um, without adding any
[SPEAKER_04]: outside genetics is a great tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can say, okay, well, you know,
when I grow five of these, they all get
[SPEAKER_04]: attacked by insects.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then that's a great time to go,
okay, well, let's go ahead and pop 10,000
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds or 500 seeds or whatever you have
room for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then basically introduce that insect
to that population and see if there's one
[SPEAKER_04]: that really shines.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you can get, um, actually a
whole variety of those particular plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: then hopefully you find one that was
insect resistant and it also has the other
[SPEAKER_04]: traits that you already liked about the
strain, which in this hypothetical thing
[SPEAKER_04]: would be likely because it was already a
strain you liked a lot, but it just wasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: resistant to bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in that case, that's when you really
want to do selective breeding within the
[SPEAKER_04]: gene pool and bottleneck out all the
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by taking, um, that one plant and you
can backcross to it and backcross to it
[SPEAKER_04]: and backcross to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because it's already a consistent
strain, um, backcrossing to that plant is
[SPEAKER_04]: really going to dominate the gene pool
with itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's actually like a really good
time to, um, inbreed and backcross and do
[SPEAKER_04]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you wouldn't want to throw out all the
other stuff because down the line you
[SPEAKER_04]: might realize, Hey, wait, there's another
trait we didn't know because we had never
[SPEAKER_04]: seen this type of wilt before or we'd
never seen this type of mildew or blight
[SPEAKER_04]: or new strain of insect or species of
insects.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you still want to have the other ones,
you know, put in cold storage or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now you have this new line where you
can go, okay, sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not getting eaten by thrips every
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like who's getting eaten by thrips is
obviously a terrible plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got to go ahead and go for this part
of the population, preserve the part that
[SPEAKER_04]: we really don't want right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so that we know we have it in case we
need something from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Later, but now we'll take this new
direction where we have this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the other, the other place would be
okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, well, we grew out 500 or we grew out
10,000 and we didn't find any plants that
[SPEAKER_04]: are not resistant to insects, which means
that in the past, somebody's already
[SPEAKER_04]: bottlenecked these traits into this
population and they're all going to get
[SPEAKER_04]: attacked by insects.
[SPEAKER_04]: No matter what, in that case, you're going
to have to borrow genetic material from a
[SPEAKER_04]: different, um, race of plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to have to say,
okay, we're going to go to this land race
[SPEAKER_04]: over here, or we're going to go to this,
this heirloom breed over here and go,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, look, these ones, they just,
and you grow a big population.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course it doesn't have to be that
they all grow like this, but that's the
[SPEAKER_04]: best way to do it is to find a breed where
none of them get attacked by insects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe if you're lucky, this plant
already breeds true for a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: traits you liked about the other strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way you're making less work for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's say you have a strain that gets
attacked by insects.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a great smell that you really love.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it gets you high like you want the
plant grows like you want it to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it finishes when you want it to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only drawback is that it gets
attacked by insects.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then maybe by some luck, you know,
um, you find another strain that has all
[SPEAKER_04]: those same traits that you really like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even the terpene profiles are similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's similar weed, but you go,
well, this one over here, it doesn't get
[SPEAKER_04]: attacked by insects in any of the
population.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole thing is insect resistant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it obviously has, it breeds true for
this particular trait in this case,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is insect resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you cross the two together,
um, you know, I mean, if, if it's too,
[SPEAKER_04]: if it's so close to being perfect,
like I just said it was, then of course
[SPEAKER_04]: you'd probably just throw away the first
strain because you just found a second
[SPEAKER_04]: strain that's already perfect,
but there's going to be, there's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but I mean, I'm just saying that was,
I, that was kind of the ideal you would be
[SPEAKER_04]: looking for to have a lot of traits that
line up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, they're not all going to line
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's say strain a, uh, yields well,
but strain B doesn't yield well,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it really has the insect resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you go, okay, we do still need
something from the old strain that doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: have the insect resistance and it still is
the one that has the better buds with the
[SPEAKER_04]: better resin and all this stuff to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, okay, so it's worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then in that case, you know,
you're going to make that hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, when you make that hybrid,
you're going to go through and you're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to look for all those traits you
wanted, but you're going to look for the
[SPEAKER_04]: plants that do possess that, that,
that borrowed trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now those are going to be the plants
that you're going to breed to go forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, you know, it, it, it all really
depends on like, you know, the frequency
[SPEAKER_04]: that this particular trait pops out in
the, in the population, like, is it a one
[SPEAKER_04]: in 10?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a one in a hundred?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a one in a thousand?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if, if it's already like the,
the strains really true for that,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's going to be pretty easy to borrow
that trait into the other one because at
[SPEAKER_04]: the very least you're going to start off
and you're going to get a quarter or a
[SPEAKER_04]: third or half, or depending on how
dominant that strain is for that trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, to answer your question in a
simple way, which I never do, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say that, you know, it's not,
it's not really that hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just, you have to approach it in that
way where you go, okay, what is our list
[SPEAKER_04]: of traits that we need for this strain?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then what is, what, what are we
looking to borrow from another strain?
[SPEAKER_04]: And does this strain and does this other
strain really have it to donate?
[SPEAKER_04]: And in that case, then yeah, you'll make
your new hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll find your plants that fit the
description.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as long as they fit the description,
you take them, you breed them together,
[SPEAKER_04]: try some different combinations,
um, of parents.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, at a certain point
you'll find one that has all those traits
[SPEAKER_04]: that you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's kind of just what,
you know, like, I mean, that's not what
[SPEAKER_04]: you do when you're making simple hybrids,
but when you're breeding a strain,
[SPEAKER_04]: that, that really is something that's
going on, you know, like I do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do that with strains a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that that type of approach is
used in many, many, many other fields of
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's certainly effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, while we're on the topic of,
you know, kind of locking in traits,
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember having this discussion with Mr.
Sol about back-crossing and I specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: was interested in why he chose to use the
Shiva skunk male, as opposed to one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: brothers of, you know, the princess and
the genius in the stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said to me, well, it was,
it had good traits, obviously the Shiva
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk that he wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: But more importantly, it was really easy
to see those phenotypes when he was going
[SPEAKER_02]: through each generation back-crossing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that kind of brought up an
interesting idea because I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: one, would you guys consider doing
back-crosses in aficionado?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause a lot of the work is more kind of
F1-y type stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other question is, is that the
type of approach you would take?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you want to use something that was
really different, just such that it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, almost just doing the job of
providing the Y chromosome and then you
[SPEAKER_02]: could easily weed out most of its traits
or would you look to use something which
[SPEAKER_02]: was more similar as you just mentioned,
but the, the, uh, the implication of that
[SPEAKER_02]: is maybe it's a little harder to weed out
exactly what you don't want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, I mean, as far as to be able to
see something outright, I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to always go, okay, you want to
use, if you're going to take, say like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to take a OG and you want to
make an OG from seed, uh, let's find a
[SPEAKER_04]: male that's already almost just like OG in
every way and then we'll do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after a while I went,
yeah, but I can't see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once I did it in practice, I went,
I, it's really hard to see what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, what I realized and I started the
project and I never did anything with it,
[SPEAKER_04]: a dying breed and round table selections
and, uh, geez, I don't know, probably a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple other people did stuff with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I did was I took the, I took the deep
chunk and I put it on the fire OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I gave that to the guy who,
who gave me the deep chunk seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: originally and he called it great balls of
fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, um, what's interesting is deep
chunk is a really trippy plant because
[SPEAKER_04]: it's totally inbred and it is,
of course, um, it, it, it's, it's dominant
[SPEAKER_04]: in breedings for all these traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I would say in a lot of case,
the dark color, um, a lot of resin,
[SPEAKER_04]: broad leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but one thing that it wasn't dominant
for in out-crosses that I did,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, meaning that I guess it's probably a
double recessive trait in its gene pool is
[SPEAKER_04]: that it's height.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not dominant in out-crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what happens when you make deep chunk
cross, um, something that grows fast is
[SPEAKER_04]: you get basically deep chunk plants,
but they're very fast growing,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, I haven't grown out a large enough
population of that, but what I really
[SPEAKER_04]: wanted to do with it was go, okay,
it's going to be easy to see these plants
[SPEAKER_04]: that are the ones that aren't the
broadleafs.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be a lot more likely to
be the OG types.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, it's so dominant for that trait
that I think I'll probably have to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: out a thousand of them to be able to get a
few good plants to try combinations with
[SPEAKER_04]: that have the narrow leafs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, uh, dying breed took that and
they actually selected one that was a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit more narrow leaf and they put
that back on the fire OG again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen that grown out yet,
but I'm curious about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's an example of doing,
um, like what, uh, what Mr. Soul was
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about where you use something
that's really obvious and then it's easy
[SPEAKER_04]: to take out the problem with deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, or it's not really a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that when I do, you know,
you plant 20 or 40 of them and you go,
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, we have a bunch of giant size,
deep chunk with a little bit more THC
[SPEAKER_04]: coming from the OG, but you don't get,
you don't get many that have any kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: an OG smell, um, or an OG look to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, uh, it's kind of a pain in the
butt, but it is, um, it's definitely,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's definitely a valuable thing to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't, um, I don't see any reason
not to do, uh, bat cross projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a plant that you really,
really like, you know, I think it's a,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that, you know, doing
something that pops right out at you like
[SPEAKER_04]: that, using a plant that is different so
that you can weed it out of the population
[SPEAKER_04]: really easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's, you know, that I think
that's smart.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a sharp idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you just touched on this idea of,
you know, popping, you said popping a
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many seeds do you like to pop when you
are going to look through a line for a
[SPEAKER_02]: male for example, and as a little side
question, if you were to pop another
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders seeds, how many would you want to
pop to get an idea of whether you could be
[SPEAKER_02]: like, Oh, that's bunk or they'd do good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'd say it's all dependent on the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't think, I think there's some
strains that the way they're bred,
[SPEAKER_04]: like if you're going to pop something from
Mr. Soul, I don't think that you probably
[SPEAKER_04]: need to plant more than a pack or two
because of the way he breeds, he's locking
[SPEAKER_04]: down traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's using parents that actually mesh and
make the gene combinations that he wants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's, um, I mean, the dude,
he's a, what he's a nuclear engineer or
[SPEAKER_04]: something.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, you know, he's not just going
to be jumping into and doing stuff like
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that in comparison to somebody who
says, Hey, I'm going to take this and
[SPEAKER_04]: throw it together with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, deep chunk cross OG was
one that was, that takes big numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of this interesting interplay
between the genetics where deep chunk
[SPEAKER_04]: basically eclipses everything it collides
with.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing that really can stand out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, um, deep chunk just throws a shadow
on anything in the genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you are going to be able to get ones
out of it, but it's going to take you a
[SPEAKER_04]: bigger population to find them because
there is really true dominance for a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of its traits that it has.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but like I said, height is not one of
those traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then that kind of shows you with my
knowledge of genetics, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like I'm, I'm no rocket scientist with it,
but that, um, that's probably a double
[SPEAKER_04]: recessive because it breeds true in an
inbred population, but it doesn't breed
[SPEAKER_04]: true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, or, or it doesn't dominate anything
when you do out crosses with it at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, you know, there, there's your two
examples of, okay, here we got,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, Cindy 99 seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, or Cindy 99 fem seeds, like,
Hey, grow three, you're going to get a
[SPEAKER_04]: good plant, you know, grow regs,
grow 10, grow 20, grow 30.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have a lot of cool stuff
in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of going to be that because
that's his goal as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there's other people and there's
stuff that I make too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I make stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to make stuff, um, that is really,
really consistent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I try to make stuff that's really,
really wild because in stuff that's
[SPEAKER_04]: consistent, when you go ahead and you
plant a row of it, it behaves just how you
[SPEAKER_04]: want it to.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does everything that you want it to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It finishes when you want it to finish and
all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then, um, if you want to find
something that's really going to be out of
[SPEAKER_04]: this world and it's completely different
than anything anyone's ever seen,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're not going to get that out of your
true breeding seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your true breeding seeds only have what
you've seen from them because that's all
[SPEAKER_04]: they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Deep chunk does deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to grow deep chunk and
go, Whoa, I grew this deep chunk and I got
[SPEAKER_04]: this crazy plant with this crazy terpene
profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be like, Oh, it's just a
variation on deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pure Cindy 99.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get a variation on Cindy
99, which is awesome when you're looking
[SPEAKER_04]: for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, doing crazy,
crazy poly hybrids and stuff is really
[SPEAKER_04]: cool if you're just looking for something
that's really weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I got, uh, I got one called Nubia
that my buddy Braveheart found out of some
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds and, um, it's like one of the only
CBD plants that's at high in CBD,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, two to one ratio.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it makes really, really good full melt
hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not common with CBD plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kind of attribute some of that to
the old genetics, like the dirt perp in it
[SPEAKER_04]: that has, um, it has, you know,
it's terpene rich.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has really nice, uh, resin that's
really, uh, it's really melty anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then, you know, at the same time,
then it's this crazy, this crazy poly
[SPEAKER_04]: hybrid thing that I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you get this plant that you don't
really see this in other populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: People grow out tons of CBD and they're
like, it's great, but you can't make full
[SPEAKER_04]: melt hash with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But through doing some weirdo stuff,
you know, you get these weirdo things that
[SPEAKER_04]: you realize are valuable once you actually
put them into practice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, as far as like for, to get somebody's
seed to know if it's good, it just
[SPEAKER_04]: depends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I feel like with breeding,
it's all about like honesty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you're gonna, if it's wild,
say it's wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's ultra consistent, say it's ultra
consistent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that way, when people go to
select what they want to get from you or
[SPEAKER_04]: what they want to spend their time on to
grow, they have an idea, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: which ride they're buying a ticket for
because you, you don't want to try to
[SPEAKER_04]: grow, um, you don't want to try to grow
something where you want to get all good
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all the same and have it all be
wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some of them aren't even that
great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if someone tells you, Hey,
these seeds are wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not all good.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you find the best one in it,
you're going to have something that's
[SPEAKER_04]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it's like, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you know what you're signing up for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, so it's not so much that maybe a
better breeder is going to have more
[SPEAKER_04]: consistent seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that in my opinion, a better breeder
is going to tell you, um, what is what so
[SPEAKER_04]: that when you get into it, you know,
like, okay, do you want to have,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, you want to find this purple one?
[SPEAKER_04]: One here that's got this really special
terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: It only pops out maybe one in 20.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're probably going to want to plant
about 50 or 60 seeds just so that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you got more of a likelihood
because if it pops out one in 20 in a big
[SPEAKER_04]: population, um, somebody could buy one
pack or two packs and get 20 seeds really
[SPEAKER_04]: easily and go, well, it didn't come this
time because, you know, it's not going to
[SPEAKER_04]: hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, you want to know that when you
buy the seeds, I don't want to get seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: from somebody and have them go,
yeah, they're all this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you plant them and you go,
dude, I didn't get any of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if somebody tells you,
oh, there's all kinds of neat stuff in
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you plant it and you go,
dude, I only got one thing out of like 50
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either one of those is going to be a
disappointment, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really up to, um, for,
you know, for the breeder to be,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, ethical and give you an idea of,
of what you're getting yourself into,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a good philosophy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just on a slightly different topic,
recently we've seen the launch of your own
[SPEAKER_02]: new company, Freeborn Selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what, what inspired you to start this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it kind of a bit like Bodhi's companies
where it's just kind of like a different
[SPEAKER_02]: type of work he wants to do and what type
of things can we expect from it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you what.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like I said, you know,
I was 10 years old looking at high time,
[SPEAKER_04]: seeing people with seed companies saying,
oh, that'd be cool, you know, to have a
[SPEAKER_04]: seed company and breed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I started breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got all these different breeds,
you know, and, um, so, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like when I, when I first talked to,
uh, Leo from Efficient Auto, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: he said, oh yeah, you know, you should,
you should, you should come on the company
[SPEAKER_04]: and we'll, you know, you can do this and
do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, yeah, man, you know,
I go, uh, you know, I'm down to do stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to work with people and you know,
that's, it's cool, but you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still, I'm not just going to be,
you know, I'm not coming in to just be
[SPEAKER_04]: like part of somebody else's thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I've been doing this for,
you know, I've been, I've been,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, improving and creating strains
for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not just trying to just sign onto
somebody's stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, I basically, um, I basically just
thought, well, I have all these things
[SPEAKER_04]: that I've made, um, Efficient Auto,
the way the marketing is positioned is to
[SPEAKER_04]: say, you know, this is basically the best
weed you've ever seen, the best seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: you've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, you know, I feel like when we
have had Black Lime Reserve, I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like this is a game changer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave them to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I gave a lot of lime stuff over the
years to a lot of different people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I always ask them, you know,
is this, is this blowing stuff away?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this what you want to grow now or are
you just going to retire it?
[SPEAKER_04]: You tried it and you don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everyone who I gave it to always said,
this is something that I really want to,
[SPEAKER_04]: that I really want to go with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's like something that,
um, I felt like was appropriate to release
[SPEAKER_04]: and say, Hey, this is, this is good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this is like the best stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that I do, of course,
I'm going to think it's great,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I have to know that, okay,
it's going to match with the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to, it's going to, um,
it's going to be really big, good yields.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be great for this going to
be great for that kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: check all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, um, so I was comfortable to do
that, but honestly like to say,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, I'm just going to make seeds always,
um, to be released as being, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the greatest thing around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe they don't really, you know,
there, there's not really anything that
[SPEAKER_04]: different, you know, I'm not going to sit
here and tell you I'm a better breeder
[SPEAKER_04]: than, than Mr. Soul or Bodhi or,
uh, Inspector or Fletch or any of these
[SPEAKER_04]: guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I'm not going to sit here and tell
you that I'm, that I'm, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's hard for me to, um, to position
stuff that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, I'm like, okay, I just wanted
to do a company where I could say,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to, um, I'm going to make this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stuff that I think is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it brings a lot to the table and,
uh, people will enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, and so that's why I'm really,
you know, making the push on doing,
[SPEAKER_04]: on doing my own stuff, because anytime
when you're, when you're working with,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, people, you know, your visions have to
meet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if, if your visions aren't meeting up,
um, then it, you know, it's not,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not really, uh, conducive to,
uh, to success.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the, in that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, you know, freeborn selections is
just like, you know, my middle name is
[SPEAKER_04]: freeborn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, these are my selections and,
uh, you know, like you see, like on my
[SPEAKER_04]: thing, it's like, oh, it's a company,
you know, it's, it's a new company.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why does it say since 1997?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you know, freeborn has been
selecting since 1997.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the work is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, that's basically, you know,
that's, that's the whole thing of,
[SPEAKER_04]: of it is just going, okay, this is a place
where I can put my work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to worry about, um,
meeting any kind of standard beyond what I
[SPEAKER_04]: say it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I say it's wild, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I say it's unstable, it's unstable.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I say it's, um, if I say it's the best
strain I've ever seen, it's the best
[SPEAKER_04]: strain I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just do whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't all have to fit into the
heading of going, okay, this is the best
[SPEAKER_04]: you ever seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that's, that's a lot of pressure and
that's hard to, um, that's hard to deliver
[SPEAKER_04]: on, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just as a bit of a personal
curiosity, even though cherry lime took
[SPEAKER_02]: first place and black lime didn't,
which one do you think is actually the
[SPEAKER_02]: more stand out of the two?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, uh, black lime is really
trippy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of these ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I know a guy who used to get all the
weed from the, from, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the main diesel guys on the East coast,
the chem guys, and you know, he'd buy
[SPEAKER_04]: their weed for, you know, huge amounts of
money stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like people don't believe people pay this
much for, for weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he used to come over here and get
black lime before I crossed it with the
[SPEAKER_04]: OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, you know, I, I, I didn't ever
know until, um, I was talking to him last
[SPEAKER_04]: year and he are two years ago and he goes,
oh, you're the black lime guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go, yeah, I go, you like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he go, and he told me the story.
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes, man, that was the best weed that
I ever got was black line.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, he goes, I used to get the super
skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to get the diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to get the chem, you know,
I've seen all the OGs.
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes, the black line.
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes, that was my stuff, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that was like, I could kill it on
that back in those days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, wow, I didn't even know
back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't, you know, like you're very
isolated when you're in the, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, in the woods for one,
you're very isolated.
[SPEAKER_04]: But beyond that, when you're not,
you know, you're not really tied in,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was never one of these guys who flew to
Amsterdam or did any of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, um, anyway, you know,
my point being that for me, black line is
[SPEAKER_04]: like, it's like the best weed there is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I crossed it with, uh,
with the PK, the OG back in the day,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, not because I wanted to make any
improvements, but because I took the OG
[SPEAKER_04]: and I hit it with every male I had at the
time trying to get OG seeds because nobody
[SPEAKER_04]: wanted to grow my seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of a sudden they were talking about,
oh, we want to, we want to buy only OG
[SPEAKER_04]: because we can sell this, you know,
we can sell this in LA for $8,000 a pound
[SPEAKER_04]: and all the rest of the stuff we can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, you know, black lime for me was
really like that the heavy, it was heavy
[SPEAKER_04]: hitting, it had all the flavors,
it had fuel, it had fruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had been looking for years for something
that was like lime because my buddy who
[SPEAKER_04]: was from that crew who originally gave
some of my friends some of the original
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds that I got.
[SPEAKER_04]: They, um, they had a thing called lime and
I was always like, oh, I want to find this
[SPEAKER_04]: lime.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to, I want to breed a strain that's
lime, like a lime popsicle, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so once I finally did it, it was just
to me, I was like, here's the ultimate
[SPEAKER_04]: cherry.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I have cherry lime made and I have
black lime and I have a bag of each,
[SPEAKER_04]: say I have an ounce of each and I'm
smoking heavy, I'm going to probably smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: the black lime like 10 to one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, the cherry lime made is
incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just, it's not, it doesn't resonate
with me as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, I think that overall the cherry
lime made is more of a crowd pleaser.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's purple, but it's stony like OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has an incredible amount of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you smoke it, it literally tastes
sweet in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just like, not just like a sweet
smell, but it actually on your tongue is
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of like sweet, like sugary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, it's just really, really good
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really resistant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but black lime for me is just like,
black lime is the king of the jungle for
[SPEAKER_04]: me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, um, and then my other one that I
call root beer, which is, um, which is a
[SPEAKER_04]: headband, uh, with some, you know,
some old Afghanis and Hindu.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's super, that's super dank too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the two for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cherry lime made is totally like a back
burner strain for me as smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I want to really impress somebody
with a bud, you know, I know that unless
[SPEAKER_04]: people have a real relationship with,
uh, like a history of smoking those other
[SPEAKER_04]: things like me, I know that when they
smoke the cherry lime made that knee jerk
[SPEAKER_04]: is going to be like, Oh, that's the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if somebody has a lot of them for a
long time, you know, it's, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: the lime for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the lime is killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was listening to you on the
cannabis connection talk about the
[SPEAKER_02]: creation of the cherry lime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, interestingly enough,
I think you said that the mother was a
[SPEAKER_02]: cherry pie S one and yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I find interesting about this is
we're seeing this happen more and more,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, people are breeding with S ones
as mothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've even seen people breeding with an S
two as a mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like, you know, it's fine to
do as long as you do the necessary testing
[SPEAKER_02]: on the progeny or like, what's your
feelings on this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, um, some strains,
they have exceptional stress causing
[SPEAKER_04]: causes them to seed themselves and the,
um, the progeny from those breedings will,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, it'll take an exceptional amount of
stress to make them seed themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, something like cherry pie doesn't take
any stress at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just seeds itself, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're like some kind of phenomenal
space grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody who I know is like, dude,
you grow cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be picking off some balls
off the bottom of the plant before you
[SPEAKER_04]: flower it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's about day 21, day 25 or something,
day 30.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just going to start getting these
little balls at the bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, if I would have used that as a
mother and hit it with the lime and
[SPEAKER_04]: release cherry lime seeds, it would have
been a disaster.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I would have never done that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even at this point, I'm still,
you know, I'm still having people test
[SPEAKER_04]: them indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm growing them outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm at F4 with a few different directions
and they're all very stable outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, they're even stable indoor for really
good growers, which is better than cherry
[SPEAKER_04]: pie, but they're not, they're not stable
indoor in every, it's not every line is
[SPEAKER_04]: good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the number seven line is,
you know, one out of five, my buddy,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, my buddy Jasper had to do before he
got a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: The number eight, uh, uh, quality over
Kwan just did a few of them and he had no
[SPEAKER_04]: problems whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, the number eight, there's also,
uh, Kevin Jodri has a cut off of that
[SPEAKER_04]: that, you know, I guess does really well
no matter what.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it's a matter of,
okay, what kind of an S one is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in that case, you know,
like, here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you take the wrong road and you get to
S five or you get to S 10 or you get to S
[SPEAKER_04]: 20, you're going to have plants that are
so herm that you won't even know there's
[SPEAKER_04]: females in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just going to all be producing
pollen like mad.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you take the right turn, you're going
to get plants where you're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: dude, I watered it with all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use like everything they use to make
feminized seeds and I can't get these
[SPEAKER_04]: suckers to reverse.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just depends on which road you take.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to take it in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, I honestly, I think that there's a
big, um, lack of people making S one
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason I say that is because
people lose clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like my buddy right now, uh,
has this skunk six.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this incredible plant and everybody
wants it and nobody has it and he has it
[SPEAKER_04]: and he's almost lost it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's my opinion, not that these seeds
need to be distributed necessarily,
[SPEAKER_04]: but that they do need to be made.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I told him, I'm all, dude,
get some of those cuts up there to inspect
[SPEAKER_04]: and have them S one those out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got the seeds to put in the
fridge because, um, you know, as long as
[SPEAKER_04]: you test out a stress test, those S ones,
you're going to find S ones that are more
[SPEAKER_04]: stable than the mother they came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're going to find some that are
less.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the nature of genetics is that
you always get something that's more so
[SPEAKER_04]: and one that's less.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get like, uh, you know,
a more resonant, this plant and you get a
[SPEAKER_04]: less resonance plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a more purple plant and you get a
less purple plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a taller one, you get a shorter
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get all these combinations of
whatever's in the gene pool of the plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I really think that, um,
that selfing stuff is neat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had this Northern lights back in the
day, that one we got an 89 from seeds and
[SPEAKER_04]: it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's still to this day is one of my
favorite plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I underrated it for years because it was a
little plane on the herb side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although the flavor was incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I just kind of didn't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a little bit, um, uh, infatuated
with smells that were a little more crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't really realize how amazing of
just like a hash plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: This thing was, and it used to in cases
where like the generators would die for,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, a couple of days before they
could get back up and running,
[SPEAKER_04]: or it would get heat stressed or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: These different issues are it would seed
itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, these seeds, we always went,
Oh, they're hermy seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we always threw them away.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every year there would be one or two
that would be in the compost pile would
[SPEAKER_04]: come up and we go, Oh, it's a girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go ahead and grow it, give it a
shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'd always be perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, you know, we just thought,
just throw the seeds away.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like, wasn't looking at the evidence
that no, look, these plants are good
[SPEAKER_04]: because we already had the clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I figured I'd never lose that clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we got it in 89.
[SPEAKER_04]: That clone was around to like 2005,
but then that clone got lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only guy who had it, um, he lived by
the Russian river, which is notorious for
[SPEAKER_04]: flooding.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had it in a trailer in a grow by the
Russian river.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Russian river flooded.
[SPEAKER_04]: It washed the trailer and all the stock
was lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and now I go, God, I wish I had some,
I wish I had one of those bags of handfuls
[SPEAKER_04]: of beautiful brown pear shaped Northern
lights, S one seeds that I threw away,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, um, I think it's important that
people do it for preservation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know as much for distribution
unless people kind of let you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like you really got to know the parent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it hermy prone?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it not hermy prone?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause if it's a hermy prone parent and you
know, if it's prone to intersect straight,
[SPEAKER_04]: then you're gonna, you know, you're gonna
have, you're gonna have some problems with
[SPEAKER_04]: those seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for preservation purposes,
I think that feminized seeds and self
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds are, um, are really neat tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, especially in the case where you
have the clone and you don't have the
[SPEAKER_04]: population of seeds to pull a male from or
whatever, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so maybe it's like a little follow up
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that if you have a plant that
doesn't display any hematidic traits on in
[SPEAKER_02]: normal cases, you know, like it's just a
stable plant by all measure, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: but for whatever reason it's exposed to
some serious stress, maybe a light leak,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, and it produces some nanas
and makes some S ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that those seeds are
necessarily more hermy prone, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause the general consensus would be that
like a plant that tends to hermy,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the seeds will likewise tend to
hermy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm interested, like if a stable plant
makes S ones due to the stress,
[SPEAKER_02]: is, is those offspring any more likely to
hermy than the mother?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like are they stable as well, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a crazy stigma surrounding
the whole thing where people go,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, feminized seeds, hermy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the reason why is because a
lot of people take plants that are easy to
[SPEAKER_04]: reverse.
[SPEAKER_04]: They reverse them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They make quote unquote, feminized seeds,
which really aren't feminized.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're usually about 90%.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can go all the way back to
marijuana botany that I read when I was a
[SPEAKER_04]: kid and they tell you, Hey, if a plant
seeds itself, you're going to probably get
[SPEAKER_04]: about 90% female.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to get the rest of them
are going to be like true intersex plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: which means you know, you're going to have
like, uh, you're going to have balls on
[SPEAKER_04]: one side and hairs on the other side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think that because people did that
where they took these plants, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: that go really easy, you know,
like the apple doesn't fall far from the
[SPEAKER_04]: tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a plant that likes to seed
itself and it seeds itself, you're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to have a progeny that are going to like
to seed themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a plant that won't seed itself
unless it's in very, um, unusual
[SPEAKER_04]: circumstances, then you're going to get
progeny where the bulk of those seeds are
[SPEAKER_04]: not going to, um, they're not going to
seed themselves unless they're under those
[SPEAKER_04]: same extraordinary circumstances.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, yeah, I really think that that,
um, I really think that the stigma
[SPEAKER_04]: surrounding feminized seeds, I really
think it comes from people choosing poor
[SPEAKER_04]: parents and that if you use the right
parents, then you know, you're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: get something good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think it's important that
people understand that being that there's
[SPEAKER_04]: no male in the cross and that some of
those plants in the cross are going to
[SPEAKER_04]: represent the male plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, those are going to be the ones
that are like males with hairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like 50, 50.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know, you shouldn't be surprised if
you get a pack, if you get a, if you get,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, you know, 10 seeds and one of those
are two of those seeds in that pack,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, is going to be a full blown,
uh, intersex plant because those are
[SPEAKER_04]: basically the males in the pack.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that you want to use those as males,
but that those are the ones that are in
[SPEAKER_04]: the population trying to, um, ensure that
they make more seeds, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, sorry, go on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, no, no, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say, you kind of
jumped in on the next question I was going
[SPEAKER_02]: to ask in that, yeah, should you ever use
those intersex ones as males?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know that the most notable example
in my mind is, um, and this is not like a
[SPEAKER_02]: bad thing cause I think the strain is
quite good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Paiute Purple by Kanna Biogen,
they said that that whole project
[SPEAKER_02]: initially started by finding what was
essentially a male bubba kush out of what
[SPEAKER_02]: was meant to be a pack of S1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've bred that for several
generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe not the best example,
but overall the work doesn't seem to be
[SPEAKER_02]: super hermy prone, but I mean,
it also has basically no potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as my own growing saw, how do you
feel about using those males?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other little point I'll add is DJ
short once said that he thought they were
[SPEAKER_02]: the best males, like the males,
which had a few pollens, a few pistols on
[SPEAKER_02]: them and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I always thought that's really
weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, was that just like a, an idea he
just pulled out of nowhere?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, I don't think it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that I've kind of been
trying to explore talking to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that, um, I've been able to
read a little bit on forums that Tom Hill
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ short, um, various people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a breeder of a really successful
strain who doesn't actually want to be
[SPEAKER_04]: mentioned by name or by strain because he
used a male like that and he got basically
[SPEAKER_04]: the most stable progeny anyone's really
ever seen out of any of their stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a male.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a, there's a division though.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have ones that are straight feminized.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you, and then they come up and
they, um, or self or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they come up and they're,
they're like 50 50.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's hairs at first and there's balls
at first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those ones to me, those are very
unattractive because in, in, in,
[SPEAKER_04]: in my mind, although I've never seen it in
practice in my mind, that's what they are
[SPEAKER_04]: going to bring to the table is more plants
that are just 50 50 and 50 50 doesn't play
[SPEAKER_04]: for us, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Difference though, between what DJ short's
talking about, which is actually a male
[SPEAKER_04]: plant, which shows male and grows as a
male all the way until it reaches towards
[SPEAKER_04]: the late part of its life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of a sudden starts to grow hairs,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now there's, there's females we know,
and this is where people are going to
[SPEAKER_04]: start to go, Oh, mean jeans lost it here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not saying just as a disclaimer,
I'm not saying this is what I'm going to
[SPEAKER_04]: start doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't actually done any real work with
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not solid stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just something to basically tickle
your brain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can actually go, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, this is, well, this is a,
this is a moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have these plants that grow and
they're completely male and I have seen
[SPEAKER_04]: them and they come from ultra stable lines
like some of my Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, I got this stuff from Kentucky
from a buddy of mine, a Shanti Farms that
[SPEAKER_04]: was really good and really stable and
showed no problems whatsoever with the
[SPEAKER_04]: females ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the males, when they reach a late
stage of flowering, they begin to produce
[SPEAKER_04]: a little bit of female flowers in the male
clusters.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, what I think is interesting is
that we know that there's things like hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: that basically are 50-50 like those plants
we're talking about that come out of the S
[SPEAKER_04]: ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, they're 50-50 because when they grow
hemp, they want it to finish at the same
[SPEAKER_04]: time and males finish early and they begin
to basically break down and you start to
[SPEAKER_04]: screw up your hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't get as big.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have a consistent, um,
agricultural crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's normal.
[SPEAKER_04]: We already know that that's normal and can
happen in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we know that a 50-50 state exists,
um, then we also know that we have these
[SPEAKER_04]: plants where the females, when they go
late, the females start to actually,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, stress or feel overdone or feel
freaked out because they haven't set seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: yet or whatever it is and then they start
to get, you know, some balls late in life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually there's a lot of different types
of it but, um, you know, some of them get
[SPEAKER_04]: just the bananas or some get little balls
up at the top or however they do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's just interesting to, to,
to wonder that, okay, if that is one side
[SPEAKER_04]: of it, could that, could that,
and, and, and it's genetically influenced
[SPEAKER_04]: because we know it is because plants that
are, you know, quote unquote, hermy-prone,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, they are hermy-prone.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is their gene pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not all environment, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so you have to wonder, okay,
is there an opposite state to that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a state where the females,
like, assuming that it's possible that
[SPEAKER_04]: the, the, the females that go hermy are,
are gene pools that are, like,
[SPEAKER_04]: so male that even the females are slightly
male.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could there be an opposite state where the
females are so female that even the males
[SPEAKER_04]: are slightly female?
[SPEAKER_04]: And would that be the most stable form of
genetics for what we want it for?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the females will never produce male
parts?
[SPEAKER_04]: And is that what that would look like?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not saying that that's how it is
or that's the case but that's the point
[SPEAKER_04]: that, uh, Tom Hill, um, DJ Short,
who are definitely not rookies in the
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding game, they're, they were curious
about it and when I read about it,
[SPEAKER_04]: I became curious about it too because,
um, you have to wonder, okay, if we have a
[SPEAKER_04]: 50-50 state and we have a state where the
gene pool is so male that even the females
[SPEAKER_04]: are slightly male, is there, uh,
gene pools where the, the females are so
[SPEAKER_04]: female that even the males are slightly
female?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that, anyway, that's that whole thing
you were just, uh, you brought up from DJ
[SPEAKER_04]: Short.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, that's actually,
um, how should I say, reassuring to hear
[SPEAKER_02]: because I done the same thing with one of
my lines and I too found that the progeny
[SPEAKER_02]: were all extremely stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't found any hermies, but what I
wanted to ask was, have you ever done it
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself in that you had the male?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get males?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I got a female and I'm growing it out
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been told that if you do that,
that you'll get males, but I've never,
[SPEAKER_04]: like I said, I've never done anything with
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all theory for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just that I, I see these guys who
are kind of, who, who, who are,
[SPEAKER_04]: who are, um, experienced and who are older
than me and here they are, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: playing with this idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it looks interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, it's all totally speculation.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's why I was making sure
that people know that, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not on the, I'm not drinking the
Kool-Aid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just am curious, you know, how it
tastes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good phrase, good phrase.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to jump off topic for a moment at
the Emerald Cup, I was really grateful to
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to try some of the skunk you were
playing with.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing I remember taking away from it
was it had this awesome skunky metallic
[SPEAKER_02]: vibe and it made me wonder, what do you
think is the deal with metallic tasting
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes or weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like surely it has to be a terpene
combination, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like surely we're not inhaling,
you know, larger than normal levels of
[SPEAKER_02]: aluminum or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I can tell you, you know,
that because I, because I grew it and I
[SPEAKER_04]: dried it, um, I know that there's nothing
weird in that weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, uh, it's very metallic to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells like blood was kind of my take
on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it really like, it smells like you
have a nosebleed kind of, and it,
[SPEAKER_04]: it smells like skunk, like the animal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of a true skunky smell with a
lot of metal behind it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, that came out of the black lime.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a weird throw.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and you know, I don't really know,
but I do know that there's stuff going on
[SPEAKER_04]: that is separate from terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, we consider terpenes to be
responsible for a hundred percent of the
[SPEAKER_04]: smell in weed, but there is other stuff
that goes on in there that creates smells,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, aside from, you know, things in nature
that create smells like, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: bacteria or fungus or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, you know, I, I, I wonder,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what is, what is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: What is, what's the blood terp?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's really weird,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That weed was so killer though.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really, that was a really
exceptional, um, plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And luckily I made some seeds on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the future, I'll probably go through
them and I still have some of the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I suppose I could get it tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then, you know, that might give us
an answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I need to probably start doing
that, basically filing away, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: a sample of every single plant,
just so that if something comes into
[SPEAKER_04]: question, um, in hindsight, we can go
ahead and test it, even though we kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: missed the boat because I can still test
that now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah, really, really, really,
that's a really weird one, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I don't, I don't know what that is,
but I mean, there's, there's, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, there's like the purple color
and weed, um, has, has a flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, depending on what it is, uh,
you know, there's, there, there is stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might not necessarily be a terpene,
but it seems like it's, it probably is a
[SPEAKER_04]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just weird because I don't ever see
like on the terpene wheel them going,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, this smells like a old dirty nickel
or you know, smells like the gate,
[SPEAKER_04]: the chain on your gate or an old dirty
lock or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how that weed smelled.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was some really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, jumping to the next little skunk
question, the roadkill skunk, long
[SPEAKER_02]: debated, much talked about on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're slowly getting there though.
[SPEAKER_02]: First and foremost, what do you think the
genetics are?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because over time we've had a larger and
larger amount of guests, um, seem to
[SPEAKER_02]: either agree or throw it out there that it
is also their belief that the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the name roadkill skunk is likely just a
namesake for how it smells, but not a
[SPEAKER_02]: reference to the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most people have been thrown it out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think it was maybe an Afghani even.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can chuck my two pennies from
the peanut gallery here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really have, um, you know,
this is definitely not my expertise is
[SPEAKER_04]: what is skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but what have I seen that was skunky?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the super skunk was skunky and
we know that was Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's a cross of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a skunk Afghani years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am, you know, like I said, it's not
really my, not my thing is the skunk,
[SPEAKER_04]: but, um, I have only ever grown one plant
that to me was like, really like a dead
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it from, I got it from Steve,
uh, see money's dad.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was, uh, what he called pissy pungent
favorito.
[SPEAKER_04]: He gave, uh, like Spanglish names to a lot
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where I got the name, uh,
pina for my pineapple strain that I got
[SPEAKER_04]: from those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, pissy pungent favorito,
man, it was that kind of weed where if you
[SPEAKER_04]: have it, you know, you like got to
apologize to people, even if they smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's like, Hey, sorry,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got this in my pocket guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, like, Hey, you need to,
you need to probably wash your t-shirt and
[SPEAKER_04]: go, you know, take a bath in some tomato
juice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you smell like you got dirty laundry
and skunk all over you, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just funky.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funky and raw.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was, here's the thing to me is the
reason why I'm interested in skunk is not
[SPEAKER_04]: because I'm that impressed by something
that smells like a dead skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was because when I had that weed,
which was an Afghani, um, it tasted so
[SPEAKER_04]: delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so hard to describe what it tasted
like.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was this, like, I don't know,
man, like I, you know, it's one of those
[SPEAKER_04]: weird ones where I can only describe it as
tasting like, the color of like a,
[SPEAKER_04]: like a parking cone here in the States,
you know, just like, it was like this
[SPEAKER_04]: orange, not like citrus, but it was this,
it was just this thing that just lights up
[SPEAKER_04]: your tongue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like so hard to describe, man,
but it was such an incredible smell and
[SPEAKER_04]: taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, it was just like my favorite weed
ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had one little plant of it and I
grew that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the first time in 94 that I grew
those seeds that I got.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I never had another thing like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the closest I saw to it, it was what I
called the Arcata super skunk,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I'm not positive if it's the skunk
six or the skunk four or any of these
[SPEAKER_04]: other ones that people have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm excited to see the skunk six cause
talking to, um, talking to a couple guys,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, it seems like it could be the same
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like the closest thing that I
ever smelled to the pissy pungent was a
[SPEAKER_04]: super skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, um, you know, like honestly,
like out of the line, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you smelled that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the ballpark of, of animal,
animal funk skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of skunkiness in the lime.
[SPEAKER_04]: The lime will make your clothes smell like
a skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll make your car smell like a skunk,
but up close it smells, um, like,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, usually like a mix of like,
uh, you know, gasoline, lime peels,
[SPEAKER_04]: urinal cakes, and, uh, you know,
spearmint and earth and moss.
[SPEAKER_04]: And funk and, but, but from a distance,
it smells like a skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was a lot of weed back in the
day that was really skunky from a distance
[SPEAKER_04]: more so than now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then there was some stuff that's
there's another skunk too, that was
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghani based actually there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a buddy up here, um, and,
uh, we called him, we called him a Grimple
[SPEAKER_04]: and the weed that his family had,
we'd call it Grimps grapes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to this day, Grimps grapes is one of
those strains that, um, is one of those
[SPEAKER_04]: lost, lost grail strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if somebody had that, it would be
incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like when you would open it up in
the car, you wouldn't think someone opened
[SPEAKER_04]: weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You would think somebody, uh, drove by a
dead skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you smelled it up close,
it smelled like a skunk, but it smelled
[SPEAKER_04]: like pine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only reason why it was called
grapes was because it was purple and it
[SPEAKER_04]: had nothing to do with the smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was skunk pine and it was skunky
really, um, in, in an amazing way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was super, super funky.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, that was another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was one that you could really
easily look at the weed and go,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, that's Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just a straight Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, and I mean, you can go back and you
can read like marijuana botany and you can
[SPEAKER_04]: read any of these old books and they'll
tell you if you want acrid, skunky,
[SPEAKER_04]: funky weed, you know, it comes from
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I smell a skunk, I smell coffee,
onion, burnt rubber, garlic, and what
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody calls skunk that you think of
when you smell a skunk at a distance.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you've ever had like a house
skunked or a car or ran over a skunk in an
[SPEAKER_04]: old car, it makes your eyes burn and it
smells more like burnt.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells like, it smells like somebody,
you know, put, um, you know, a piece of a
[SPEAKER_04]: tire, a bunch of garlic, a bunch of
onions, and they took that all and they
[SPEAKER_04]: lit it on fire and blew it in your face.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what that, and some coffee beans,
you know, that's what it really smells
[SPEAKER_04]: like.
[SPEAKER_04]: A real fucking dead skunk on the road for
people who haven't actually, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: smelled a, you know, an American skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's a really, really funky smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's the smell we think of
from weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the skunky smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, if anybody's going to have a real
roadkill skunk, I mean, there's those,
[SPEAKER_04]: those are smells that I've smelled come
out of Afghani a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not rare to smell a garlicky,
oniony, a coffee-ish, um, those things
[SPEAKER_04]: come out a burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, someone's going to have to
find the right combination of something
[SPEAKER_04]: that smells kind of like what I gave to
you and then have the heavy coffee,
[SPEAKER_04]: the heavy burnt onion, the burnt garlic,
the burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those, those things are, you know,
when I smell a dead skunk up close,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's how it hits me in the nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's, that's so interesting in
relation to that grapes, uh, the Graham's
[SPEAKER_02]: grapes about how it's purple, but it's not
like skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we also referenced earlier how a lot
of purple stuff tends to smell the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think ultimately the question is though,
is do you think in theory cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole has the potential to generate almost
or including every smell possible,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to speak?
[SPEAKER_04]: I, um, as far as I've seen, I think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know at least at one point it
did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about our current gene pool
and what we've done with it because,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it takes who knows how many
thousands or millions of years it took to
[SPEAKER_04]: reach a point of diversity where it really
produced everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we kind of grabbed it all and did
what we did with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's been bottlenecked out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's interesting with genetics is
that everything's still in there,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's not maybe in their short term.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we, like there might be tons of stuff
with roadkill skunk and I know we could
[SPEAKER_04]: get it back to be that exact thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and maybe it's there right now,
but if it's not there right now,
[SPEAKER_04]: we don't know if it's going to take six
months or 6,000 years to get back to the
[SPEAKER_04]: point where we've opened the genetics back
up to that point because things get
[SPEAKER_04]: bottlenecked out and we think of them as
being completely gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you were to grow millions of these,
then, you know, things would pop back out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, we're not, you know,
we don't have, there's not enough people
[SPEAKER_04]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think to bring back the diversity
that was there possibly at one point,
[SPEAKER_04]: but, uh, just to answer the question,
yes or no, I think yes, I think cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: has the potential to produce any smell
that exists anywhere else in the world,
[SPEAKER_04]: including bacterial and fungal smells.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, I think so as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, yeah, it'd be interesting to
see what it would take to actually do such
[SPEAKER_02]: a thing given like, I mean, certainly like
for me, mango pops up more than any other
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's just the things I select,
but it's like, given that like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, there's a lot of things which must
go unrepresented.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there, you know, there's things that
just really take over gene pools.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really easy, um, for, you know,
I mean, uh, you know, I'm not a,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a terpene scientist, but,
um, you know, if such a thing exists.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as my understanding is that a
lot of times, um, it's like, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, uh, limonene and, uh, and mercine
tend to be kind of the, like the
[SPEAKER_04]: precursors to a lot of the other terpenes
that develop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kind of noticed that because I'll
smell something and I'll go, ah,
[SPEAKER_04]: this one smells like train wreck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'll go over here and I'll go,
ah, this one smells like that sweet
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghani kind of berry grape tootsie pop
kind of smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then later on they develop and I go,
there's none of that left.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not there at all, but it kind of is
there to start.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, you know, I think that those
things, what happens is they kind of take
[SPEAKER_04]: over, they kind of take over gene pools to
where it's like, wow, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you got anything that's got that kind
of train wrecky Amsterdam, Hayes smell in
[SPEAKER_04]: there, or you have anything that has that
kind of grapey raspberry sweet,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, thing, it's like they, they take over
gene pools so much that I think they've
[SPEAKER_04]: given themselves the reputation of being
generic smells at this point, because
[SPEAKER_04]: they're just so dominant, um, in gene
pools.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that, um, you know,
everybody hybridizing things and kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: mishmash and, and hodgepodge and stuff up,
I think over, um, over the years that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: like, okay, well you have this,
you have this real special thing over here
[SPEAKER_04]: that smells like roses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you crossed it with this thing
that smells like train wreck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Rose is not going to overtake
train wreck.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now you just took a gene pool that had
something special in it and you kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: erased it unless you want to grow,
like I said, you want to grow thousands or
[SPEAKER_04]: millions of plants to try to, you know,
recuperate those, those kinds of funk,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's safe to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: One wrong step forward is going to take a
crazy amount of effort to undo it in using
[SPEAKER_02]: those seeds generated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, cause, cause you have
these different genes, they behave
[SPEAKER_04]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't play well with others at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just come in and they just basically,
you know, they just, they just bully the
[SPEAKER_04]: whole yard, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's like, okay, well we,
now we have this, you know, I have one
[SPEAKER_04]: that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it has that smell, but it has all
these other smells and it, it actually
[SPEAKER_04]: keeps the smell and the other finer smells
with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's called candelabra.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it from a friend of mine in,
uh, 2004 and it was, I used to call it the
[SPEAKER_04]: 10,000 smells and some people smell it and
they go, Oh, it smells like train wreck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, dude, smell it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, Oh, it smells like
grape.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, smell it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, Oh, it smells like orange.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has all these terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when we see it get tested,
um, you send it to SC labs where they test
[SPEAKER_04]: for like 35 terpenes and it hits for like
33 of them and there's not many strains
[SPEAKER_04]: that do stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it really does have a lot of,
it really does have thousands of flavors
[SPEAKER_04]: in it, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, but that's a neat one where it
has that thing in it that I kind of turned
[SPEAKER_04]: off by.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of the train wreck smell
because it just is, it's like kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: overly common, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: But it, um, but it has something really
nice to it, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, it's, they don't, yeah,
they don't always ruin everything,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they have a tendency for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, while we're on the topics of
like labs and all the modern kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques that go along with that,
the emergence and growing popularity of
[SPEAKER_02]: these kind of, um, pre-sexing science kits
you can get seems to be growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Initially, I figured it would probably be
something more a breeder would be
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to be just on the rise growing
in, in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this something you would be interested
in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, because I mean, given how many seeds
you run through, I figure maybe not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, you'd be spending crazy
amounts of money on it, but at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: time, it seems to be a growing technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do you think it'll stick around
long-term or not really?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'll stick around long-term.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it has its benefits.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that, um, when new technologies
come around, the price line tends to drop
[SPEAKER_04]: really fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, anything that's based on
technology, uh, it has a big expense to
[SPEAKER_04]: start.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as soon as it's been established,
then the price drops and that price
[SPEAKER_04]: carries from the labs to the consumer
because they want to get everyone's money,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't just want people who have a lot
of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're trying to get their prices
down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, I think eventually it would be
practical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, my joke as a, uh, as a, as a troll on
social media was that I'll do it when it
[SPEAKER_04]: costs less than a pot and some dirt
because, um, I can't and, uh, I can grow
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant till it's a male for cheaper
than I can get it tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they want $8 a test and I can
grow a plant until it sexes and see what
[SPEAKER_04]: it is, um, for less than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in that case, I was like, yeah,
I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna do it myself,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it would be practical and it could be
practical for certain projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you really don't want the males,
I think that it's practical for people who
[SPEAKER_04]: have their areas maxed out and they want
to only transplant their females,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, so that they don't have to grow the
males for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, losing the plants before they show
what they are is just foolish because I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: a breeder, you know, like if it's,
if it's a terrible plant, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_04]: kill it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's a good plant, I want to keep
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's a male, even better,
you know, like I don't want my best plant
[SPEAKER_04]: to be, if I, you know, whatever I can,
whatever I can measure just by looking at
[SPEAKER_04]: it and smelling it and stuff and veg,
I'm hoping that's a male, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: cause I'm like, okay, this is the one in
this breed that I know is killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if I was growing a bunch of deep
chunk and I see the one that has the
[SPEAKER_04]: smaller leaves that taco on the edge is a
little harder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I'm, and I'm looking at that and
I'm associating that with the best type of
[SPEAKER_04]: deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I'm like fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I hope this is a male,
you know, because if this is a male,
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell which ones of the females have
that, but the males are a lot harder to
[SPEAKER_04]: tell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I can see these things that I
really know relate to the traits that pop
[SPEAKER_04]: up in the females, then I'm going to be
going, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad it's a male.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, it's not that practical,
but for people who are, um, who are
[SPEAKER_04]: growing to produce flowers, um,
exclusively, I think that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's something people can do and,
um, you're going to go from being in your
[SPEAKER_04]: little six packs or your little four inch
pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and instead of going, instead of up
potting into all these bigger pots,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're just going to be able to take your
females and stick them right into your
[SPEAKER_04]: final pots, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So number one, you can skip a
transplanting stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can skip a nursery stage, um,
where you're actually building them up to
[SPEAKER_04]: be ready to go into their final homes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can go ahead and get them into
their final homes established,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is, it can be a benefit too,
if you have the right strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think it's practical.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how about on the other end of the
spectrum with the labs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wait for this truck to go past my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you can hear it,
but it's pretty loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's not popping up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so on the other end of the spectrum
with labs, how do you feel about the,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, THC values and I guess the newly
emerging terpene values for someone like
[SPEAKER_02]: you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess terpene values are quite important
given, um, you know, how well your strains
[SPEAKER_02]: do chart on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always been, you know,
the ongoing debate about, um, the validity
[SPEAKER_02]: of the THC values given and how they seem
to be kind of creeping up over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your take on all of this,
you know, and how do you think like the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene values are going to slowly over
time become, uh, more highly valued than
[SPEAKER_02]: the THC values?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, well, to, to start off, like I can
say, that, um, I know there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: people who are, as far as inflated
numbers, I know there's people who are,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, adding resin to their flower samples.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in that case, it's really easy to jump
from 21 to 29 or 27 to 32 or, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: then I know also there's breeders who are
using, um, testing to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_04]: males they're using are the highest THC
male.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is a new thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fem, testing the females as well
as a new thing you didn't used to be able
[SPEAKER_04]: to test.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I think that that will make the
numbers jump up too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think that, uh, for me,
I'm not looking for the highest THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking for the strongest effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my joke is that I test on humans,
you know, you can test it in the lab all
[SPEAKER_04]: you want, but I've noticed over the years
that I, I smoke some stuff from reputable
[SPEAKER_04]: guys that test at reputable labs and the
THC might be really high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and it might be really high in certain
terpenes, but when, you know, people smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: it, they don't really think it's that
strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't really hit you that hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, I think really like labs are neat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I think basically they're a little
bit more, they're more valuable as far as
[SPEAKER_04]: for finished product, like telling what's
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if we already know it's good,
then the lab is cool to tell us why.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we go, okay, this is the most potent
weed I've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we want the lab to tell us why.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we go and we see, okay, well,
it turns out it's only 14% THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how can this be the most potent?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here we got CBG and then it turns
out we didn't know, but there's THCV.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it turns out that there's this
certain ratio of this terpene to that
[SPEAKER_04]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they're all together,
you get this effect that creates the most
[SPEAKER_04]: potent weed with a 14% THC, uh,
content or, you know, however it is,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's hypothetical, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, for me, as far as breeding,
to answer that part of the question,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, you know, I, I, you know, I,
I'm, I'm too young to be a hippie and,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, I'm too not hippie to be a hippie as
well, but I'm kind of a hippie man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I like to look at the plants and kind
of talk to the plants and communicate with
[SPEAKER_04]: them and see which one really,
um, you know, when I smell it,
[SPEAKER_04]: like there's these certain smells that pop
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, cherry limeade and black lime are
bred purely on stem rubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not really something that I can
show people what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this thing where I go, that's that
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen that before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I saw that before, that was
incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, so for me, the labs are cool to
tell me what that means.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I see this, what does that tell me?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if I can see a correlation that
says every time I see this, and then when
[SPEAKER_04]: I test it, it turns out that it has this
in common, then maybe I can test and I can
[SPEAKER_04]: go for the ones that have more of that,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: But at this point for me, it's really,
um, it's really more a question of,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, you know, like what do I like and,
um, and what kind of makes my brain jump
[SPEAKER_04]: when I see it or I smell it or,
you know, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really like it because I know that
all of the good things, like I said
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier, that we see in weed, they've been
there for a long time and, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: all of the genetics that we have are still
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: From people doing traditional breeding
where they basically are doing just,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, um, you know, I'm comfortable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm comfortable, honestly, like with just
picking plants and making seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like as long as I do open
pollinations, um, to preserve the genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: that I'll be all right, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I'm, I'm, I've wised up now because
I know that I know the value of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to think that everybody would have
the seeds that they gave me because it was
[SPEAKER_04]: their stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I know better when someone gives
you something, you might be the last
[SPEAKER_04]: person that has it, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, you know, I'm, I'm into trying to
do, trying to do, you know, use labs to
[SPEAKER_04]: get to new places.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, I've like,
I've really realized like, again,
[SPEAKER_04]: you gotta keep it all, you gotta keep it,
the old stuff intact and you gotta,
[SPEAKER_04]: you gotta take the new stuff in new
directions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for going in new directions,
the labs are cool, but for keeping the old
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff intact, they're worthless.
[SPEAKER_04]: The lab's not going to tell you anything
about your open pollination, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just, um, you gotta keep it all no
matter what.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you're going to selectively
line breed, then, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the lab telling you that this is the
highest THC male that they've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, well, you want the highest THC line
out of that, then that's, that's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be worthwhile, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, yeah, I think they're good to,
to, um, tell you what you're seeing,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is this like this?
[SPEAKER_04]: They can explain that for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some awesome information there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to loop back on one of the points you
made a bit earlier about using humans to
[SPEAKER_02]: test it, this is a great point that I've
always stood by.
[SPEAKER_02]: The interesting kind of counter-argument
to that point though is, is it not the
[SPEAKER_02]: same people who over time have driven the
prioritization of aesthetics, which has
[SPEAKER_02]: led to the loss of certain other
qualities?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I only kind of thought of this idea
not long ago and I, I realized it is like
[SPEAKER_02]: almost a bit of a dichotomy, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the best weed is the stuff that
you've got to try for yourself and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just overall effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, we also knowingly
push for the most aesthetic weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: which we do at least now know is generally
not the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, I mean, you know, like a big fat
bud, a really, really sugary look,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they don't necessarily,
I mean, like the black aphi that I had,
[SPEAKER_04]: sure it had big fat buds and was purple
and pretty, but it looked like it had no
[SPEAKER_04]: resin on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even when I crossed it with a Hindu Kush,
which is a really white looking bud,
[SPEAKER_04]: like incredibly white weed when you grow
it indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, once it was crossed, you'd look at the
weed and you'd go, there's no resin on
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'd break it up and your hands
wouldn't get sticky and you'd roll it up
[SPEAKER_04]: and you'd inhale it and you would go,
holy shit, this is potent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just on the, it was, the expansion
and the exhale and the flavor and then the
[SPEAKER_04]: effect that just immediately got you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it wasn't, you know, to look at it,
you would think this is, this is,
[SPEAKER_04]: this stuff sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And based on looking, based on that,
I would say that probably in test,
[SPEAKER_04]: it probably couldn't have that much THC
because it didn't have that big of a
[SPEAKER_04]: percentage of resin, but the flower was
incredible, you know, and a lot of the,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of the stuff that's all those really
cool sativas that people love so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not good looking stuff, but I'll tell
you what, if you start to think,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, this is my favorite kind of weed is
the sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of a sudden that look is going to
become attractive to you because you're
[SPEAKER_04]: like, Ooh, that looks like that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the stuff I like, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think that, I mean, it's been
documented and a lot of people have spoke
[SPEAKER_04]: on it before that, uh, everyone bred
things to be fast, sugary, fat,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, those, you know, as a smoker,
fast sugary and fat, it doesn't,
[SPEAKER_04]: that doesn't really do anything for you,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gotta have, for me, I've always bred
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like weed to be, you know, all of those
things, but then I want to have the really
[SPEAKER_04]: nice smell, the really nice taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to have a good effect and I'm not,
um, I'm not locked into, uh, a one effect
[SPEAKER_04]: type of thing, you know, like I'm not
worried if it's a racy sativa or a heavy
[SPEAKER_04]: indica, or ultra potent strain or a very
mild strain for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, whatever's special about that
strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to maintain about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, you know, like I really like,
um, I like to laugh.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I love like comedy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love funny movies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love funny people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love funny stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so if we don't make you giggle,
I'm like, Oh, what's that one?
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta try to lock that in, you know,
I gotta make sure I keep that around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, and, uh, so like there's those
little things that really, those don't
[SPEAKER_04]: show up, um, at, on a picture on
Instagram, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, I think that's why right now kind
of the king of everything is, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: like if you look on Instagram and you see
a pretty picture and you go, Ooh,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's a nice strain and you click on it,
you're like, yeah, it's probably
[SPEAKER_04]: something, probably cookie fam,
you know, it's gelato, it's sherbert,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's, um, cookies, or if not, then it's
probably OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, um, you know, cam or something from
that, from the family of, of all those
[SPEAKER_04]: fuels and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, and those are all great strains,
but I think the reason why they took over
[SPEAKER_04]: is because they look so pretty.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you get some and you try it,
you go, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of the stuff over the years,
it did just kind of go down the tubes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's just not, you know,
it's not all that good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I know there was a deal where for a
while people loved the nested calyxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the look where you have like,
you have like the, you have the pod inside
[SPEAKER_04]: the pod, inside the pod, inside the pod.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what happens is there's no room really
for the resin to develop.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you wind up with stuff where when you
break it up, there's really not that much
[SPEAKER_04]: resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: The resins only on the outside of the bud
or in between, you know, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: hairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: People think, you know, the, the,
uh, the stigma of the hair is,
[SPEAKER_04]: is attractive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they breed for their weed to be very
hairy, Harry's burnt, hairs burn hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't produce, um, they don't produce
resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I've seen some where seemingly
they do produce resin, but they certainly
[SPEAKER_04]: don't produce resin like the rest of the,
um, like the flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so yeah, I mean, I, I think it's
definitely, you know, aesthetics and,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, and ease of, of growing have,
have, um, taken stuff down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, down a notch for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not trying to have a jab at you or
anything, but recently in the aficionado
[SPEAKER_02]: catalog, we've seen the introduction of
some crosses with zittles and sunset
[SPEAKER_02]: sherbet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think a lot of people wouldn't
have predicted these ones coming out in
[SPEAKER_02]: your opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what was the reason behind doing
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like those cuts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do you, the zittles is an
interesting one because a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: reference how like it in itself is not a
great strain, but there's so much
[SPEAKER_02]: potential to make something with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, are you of that school of
thought as well?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think that the, uh, the skittles has
a lot of, um, it has a lot of neat,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, stuff to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally, it's not something I'll
grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's difficult to really have do nice,
um, you know, to come out nicely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I saw recently, um, archive just does
doing some stuff with a dot with a dosy
[SPEAKER_04]: dough.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, um, it looks really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a lot, a lot of resin,
um, dying breed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, those guys are the guys who named it,
um, skittles and, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: they, they've done cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the, I like the OZ Kush,
the Eddie lap, um, uh, basically OG seed
[SPEAKER_04]: crossed with the, with the, um,
skittles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that better than the skittles
myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: It, it reminds me a lot of what I call Sky
Cutler Kush that I have.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a cross that has some of the old
stuff, uh, from mine that mixed in with
[SPEAKER_04]: some like Skywalker and PK and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, honestly, uh, for aficionado
people, because people know me from,
[SPEAKER_04]: from, um, from, uh, you know, being at the
booth, putting stuff out, um, with
[SPEAKER_04]: aficionado, the only stuff that I ever
really did with aficionado was,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, I gave Lee, uh, some pollen and told
him that it would be great on the,
[SPEAKER_04]: in the pines clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, that got released as in the pines.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told him I had the black lime and it
would work really good with the chem.
[SPEAKER_04]: He gave me that pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was black lime reserve.
[SPEAKER_04]: I released some F threes of what I call
red Hindu Kush, which is big red cross
[SPEAKER_04]: Hindu cross pure Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, uh, what I gave him some,
um, some of my sky Skywalker cross sky
[SPEAKER_04]: Jaro.
[SPEAKER_04]: To put on, uh, to put on some stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he did that with a Louis OG and we
called that Versailles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, other than that, man,
none of, none of that stuff is my work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, all the Royal stuff is all coming
from Mendelbrot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, given that to Leo to work with,
uh, anything that you see with cookies,
[SPEAKER_04]: cherries, sherbert, Skittles, I,
you know, I, I, I, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't, I didn't make any of that stuff,
so I can't really speak on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so another kind of interesting topic
I've seen is that we've seen both an
[SPEAKER_02]: increase in price of seeds and an increase
in quality or maybe consistency in recent
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we've also seen an increase in
price for some seeds that don't equally
[SPEAKER_02]: have an increase in quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think this is going to continue?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that like, you know,
I think that there will always be a market
[SPEAKER_02]: for high price seeds that are incredibly
good quality and we've got some of that
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also think that, yeah, like we might
get more and more people selling bunk
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds for just more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that's going to continue or
do you even agree with the idea that the
[SPEAKER_02]: price of seeds has kind of increased over
time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, I mean, um, I think the most
expensive stuff that I really saw was like
[SPEAKER_04]: some of that, I guess, like alien stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I heard people were doing those for
like, you know, a thousand and fifteen
[SPEAKER_04]: hundred and of course people do like
charity auctions and stuff and,
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff brings in like ridiculously high
prices, but people, people spend different
[SPEAKER_04]: for that kind of stuff because,
um, you know, it's just a different thing
[SPEAKER_04]: and, uh, it's like buying a thousand
dollar plate of food or something,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, but, um, as far as like stuff
being high priced, I mean like,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, black lime reserve, the donation on
that was 250 and a lot of people said,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, that's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's way too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything over a hundred bucks for 10 seeds
is crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, they were gone and
then everybody was like, oh, where are
[SPEAKER_04]: they?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, well, there's only 300
packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why, you know, they, they have,
there's an added value when you,
[SPEAKER_04]: when you have leverage basically for your
product because it's super limited,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and I don't mean for myself,
but for the people who actually got those
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds, you know, uh, black lime reserve is
a little bit more sought after than
[SPEAKER_04]: something that comes out of a pack of
seeds that you could buy from a huge
[SPEAKER_04]: company.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's millions of packs,
you know, because, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's harder to get, but, um, I think,
uh, you know, there's, there's been stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's, um, ridiculously expensive
and there's stuff that's not ridiculous,
[SPEAKER_04]: of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, you know, sometimes I kind of
wonder, like, um, you know, I see breeders
[SPEAKER_04]: that make certain stuff and I'm like,
wow, those are so that's, that's such a
[SPEAKER_04]: small amount to get for the seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not because the seeds,
it's not the value of a seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: A seed is worth nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the genetics that are inside the
seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is this seed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise it's, you know, a hemp seeds,
a hemp seed, you know, buy it by the
[SPEAKER_04]: pound.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, for me, if there's something that
is really special, I'm willing,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I've, I've given people,
uh, I've given people $200, $300 for 10
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds because, you know, it was something
that I wanted and I, I know the value
[SPEAKER_04]: because I can take a pack of seeds and I
can get a whole ton for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, not for them, but, um,
uh, out of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you can go, okay, well, like right
now I have Bodie's, uh, super snow lotus.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super skunk cross snow lotus.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, well, I just want to buy them
out and see what they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I go, I'm going to keep that one male
and I'm going to go ahead and make sure
[SPEAKER_04]: that out of my one pack of seeds,
I have like a few hundred more seeds out
[SPEAKER_04]: of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like for one pack of seeds,
you can get hundreds of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, and I, of course you could get
thousands or millions if you were to clone
[SPEAKER_04]: them up and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, you know, I think seed value is a
trip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, um, if it's really special enough,
I think stuff is worth it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if somebody told me, Oh dude,
I got chemist stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the stuff you were talking about,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be like, well, what do you want for
them?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, like if I got to trade
somebody, if I got to trade somebody like
[SPEAKER_04]: three pounds of cherry lime aid and they
got the real thing, I'm going to be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: dude, dude, here we go right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me 15 seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you three pounds of weed because
it's something that I really want.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, value is weird, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, what's a dog worth?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's a horse worth worth?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, some horses are worth dog
food and some horses are worth,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, $800,000 or some horses are
worth $5 million.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just depends on how it breeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: What it brings to the table and all that
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, um, I think we're going to start
seeing a lot more seeds that are a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: cheaper because seeds are really easy to
produce.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if people are willing to part with
their genetics for cheap, then you can
[SPEAKER_04]: produce seeds for very cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same process pretty much as
producing hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can buy those suckers for cheap,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, I think also that there will start
to be seeds that are more and more premium
[SPEAKER_04]: as well to where people go, yeah,
these are, you know, this ridiculous
[SPEAKER_04]: amount for this pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, when I did Black Lime
Reserve, I told everybody, hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you don't find what I, you know,
I showed everybody what the weed looks
[SPEAKER_04]: like out of, out of, off of good plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, if you don't get this like this in
your pack, come back to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you two more packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people look at it and they go,
oh, well, that's so out of control.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, yeah, but there's not any,
there's not anybody else who's telling you
[SPEAKER_04]: right up front.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't get what you want,
I'm not saying if they don't germinate,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying if you get something that's
intersex or if you get these issues,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saying that if it just, you don't like
it like a restaurant, like you,
[SPEAKER_04]: you send out the steak and you asked it
for it to be rare and it comes out and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's rare and you didn't realize you don't
like rare steak.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm giving you another steak, you know,
like even if it's their fault,
[SPEAKER_04]: basically I was still guaranteeing those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, I didn't really get anybody who
ever took me up on that and I didn't get
[SPEAKER_04]: any complaints or anything, but I think
that, um, that if people are willing to,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, you know, like I, when I put those
out, people would contact me and they'd
[SPEAKER_04]: say, Hey, uh, is it all right if I make
seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd be like, there's the only,
the only, um, rule is that you make some
[SPEAKER_04]: good ones, you know, make some nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they'd say, well, what do I look
for?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd say, well, what do you want from
the seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a breeder, I would tell them here
is what, here, here's, here's some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: markers for these traits and here's some
of the markers for those traits so that,
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you want the one that's really,
really limey?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me send me pictures of your plants and
I'll tell you which one is most likely to
[SPEAKER_04]: be that throwback to that old lime line
that is, you know, the genetics are
[SPEAKER_04]: basically, you know, locked together where
you get this leaf type.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're probably going to get the lime
smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you get the smell, there it is,
you know, and, um, so I feel like if
[SPEAKER_04]: people want to really put out seeds for
really high prices and they're willing to
[SPEAKER_04]: give you a service that goes beyond just
this little thing of seeds, I feel like
[SPEAKER_04]: they're valuable and they're worth
something extra.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if somebody's going to say,
Hey, here's some seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't ever want to hear nothing about
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: These costs 20 bucks a pack.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but it just all, um,
it all depends on how people want to do
[SPEAKER_04]: their thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it really comes down to just,
uh, being ethical and saying, this is what
[SPEAKER_04]: this really is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if you find out it's not what it is,
put it on your website, put it on your,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, do whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I have my, my root beer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought for years it was 707 headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: It turns out, no, it's the headband they
call LA Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the mother of the 707 headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's in the ballpark, but I'm like,
sorry guys, it's not 707 headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is strange, not even released,
but I've been putting out, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: info about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, you know, I feel like you're
supposed to have the right info.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you do go to breed, like people
are like, don't breed with my stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, dude, you ain't going to live
forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like everybody shouldn't have to
wait for you to die to go, okay,
[SPEAKER_04]: well now I can do these seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, it's just a, it's just a
question of, I think, um, of, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, quality and like, uh,
you know, commitment to what, whatever the
[SPEAKER_04]: thing is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's your difference between your
$20 seeds and your, and your whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: $20,000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows how high prices are going to get
in the future when stuff is, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, whatever's more sought after.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause now there's a bigger community of
people, which causes more demand,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it almost raises another interesting
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: At which point do you think someone can
call, uh, some work?
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't say a cross because maybe you've
just actually line bred it, but at what
[SPEAKER_02]: point can you call work your own?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you took Mendelbrot's Royal
and took it to the F20, do you think it'd
[SPEAKER_02]: be fair to say it's kind of your own at
that point?
[SPEAKER_02]: And likewise, you know, if you make an F1,
do you feel like you can really kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: say it's yours in the sense of like,
it's, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's not just kind of borrowing off
other people's stuff too heavily.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the, I think that where the
line is drawn, um, I think that when you
[SPEAKER_04]: make a hybrid, um, and it's just a fresh
hybrid of other people's work,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it's just a hybrid of other
people's work and you did a selection and
[SPEAKER_04]: that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's like the beginning of a
process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think that as soon as you take it in
a new direction where what you get doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: come out of the things that you started
with, then it's deserving of a new name
[SPEAKER_04]: because otherwise it's almost a
misrepresentation of the old genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like in this case, if I take,
you know, like I have cherry lime made,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I go, okay, here's a black lime cross
cherry pie and I make those seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's black lime cross cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I take a selection out of the F1s
and I breed it in a new direction and now
[SPEAKER_04]: it's got some of the terpenes of the
cherry pie, but it's got the, it's got the
[SPEAKER_04]: strength and the stoniness and the
increased size of the black line.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, you know, I keep taking it in
further and further and further to the
[SPEAKER_04]: point where, um, you can't get those
plants from what you started with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then, you know, that's a new thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I don't think you ever get so far
into something where you don't need to
[SPEAKER_04]: give people credit or, um, you don't need
to give a background of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like that stuff is more of like a
academic thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's more of a, of, of like a thing
for science where you say, Hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: here's what this is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when people know what this is,
if we ever need to recreate it,
[SPEAKER_04]: we can recreate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what if, you know, say like cherry
lime aid, I lost it all, but somebody has
[SPEAKER_04]: one clone and it turns out that it's the
cure for some crazy disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I lose, then they lose the clone
and they're like, well, what was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, well, I don't know what it
was.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, well, then now nobody knows
what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they don't know where to look for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it became really useful and valuable
at a certain point from a scientific
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective, it's like, you just screwed
things up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then now it's not really what it's
supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody can backtrack.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody can figure out what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, you know, so I think like,
that's like why it's really important in
[SPEAKER_04]: ways to have your, have your, um,
you know, your lineages there and,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, and give credit to people because they
did do some work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, for your work,
then you do, then you deserve some credit
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone deserves what they deserve,
but they don't just deserve everything,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like, just because somebody has
a plant doesn't mean now they deserve all
[SPEAKER_04]: the credit for that plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's other people who,
who should get some credit too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if I knew the people who gave the
seeds to dudes who brought them here to
[SPEAKER_04]: California that were in Afghanistan,
I'd be like, yeah, it's dude over there in
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and so he's, he was the guy who had
him in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, but I don't, I only know him back to
a certain place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, and so I'll tell you,
you know, black lime comes back from Heath
[SPEAKER_04]: Ian and goes back to John and it goes back
to, um, this Burmese, uh, and it goes back
[SPEAKER_04]: to Afghani and Oaxacan and Northern
lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that's, that's all I know
about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's as far back as it goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't lose anything by saying that,
um, that it all comes, that that stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: comes from, from places like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, it's like, yeah, the reason why
black lime is black lime is because I
[SPEAKER_04]: chose a sport plant out of, um,
you know, as an oddball.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a, in a population.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I crossed it with something that
was in a completely different side of the
[SPEAKER_04]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I got it to be where it took
something from both places for the flavor
[SPEAKER_04]: and for the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I made it into something and it's
something that's, it's totally different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you can't show it to either of the
people who had originally came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they go, Oh, that's my stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, Ooh, this is nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something new.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so at that point, I feel like now
that's a new thing and sure you deserve
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I deserve credit for what that is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but you know, ethics is, ethics is
weird, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, ethics is a weird subject
because, uh, it all comes down to belief
[SPEAKER_04]: and belief isn't, um, you know,
belief in right or wrong or good or bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like a concrete thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, some people are, some people are
spiritual and they're cannibals,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, or some people are, you know,
it's like, whatever it just, everybody,
[SPEAKER_04]: basically what I, what I think comes down
to with like ethics with what's yours and
[SPEAKER_04]: what's not yours and all that is basically
like, if you have rules or you have things
[SPEAKER_04]: that you hold other people to,
um, you know, you make the rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: So follow the damn rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're your rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, don't be mad about somebody
doing something that you do all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that just isn't, that doesn't make
any sense, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, you know, I think it just,
it just all a matter of, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: do real work, make real stuff happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you get the credit for what you
did.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't, I don't need the credit from,
from Ian.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need the credit from Heath.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get the credit for doing what I did and
they get their credit for doing what they
[SPEAKER_04]: did, you know?
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, on the topic of ethics and
potentially questionable ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember around the time of the Emerald
Cup, or I think maybe even the day after
[SPEAKER_02]: it, you put up a post basically saying,
you know, along the lines of you knew that
[SPEAKER_02]: you weren't going to get placed where you
should have been.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, you know, hinted to the idea
that maybe there was some more politics
[SPEAKER_02]: behind the scenes in regards to the
judging than what the public was aware of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I just kind of misinterpret that post
or is there something a little more
[SPEAKER_02]: serious going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you know, what was going on honestly
was people were saying that I was going to
[SPEAKER_04]: win and they were saying that I was going
to win because it was fixed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason why I won was because I was
going to win no matter what.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my weed probably wasn't really that
good anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the contest isn't blind and all this
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, what I basically was saying
was, look, I've won third, I've won
[SPEAKER_04]: second, I've won first all in a row.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys think I'm going to take first
again when there's going to probably be a
[SPEAKER_04]: thousand entries from all over California,
you guys are tripping because it's just
[SPEAKER_04]: not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no way that I was going to do
that again.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just wasn't possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not like, you know, like,
yeah, I got good weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But even if, you know, there is people
were like, oh, well, I know who's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: win.
[SPEAKER_04]: That guy's going to win.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, you guys really think I'm
going to win again?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and they were like, well,
yeah, of course you'll win again because
[SPEAKER_04]: that's why you won in the first place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, no, I really won in the
first place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can tell you right now that I'm not
going to win again because I know I really
[SPEAKER_04]: won.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now if it was fixed, I'd be like,
yep, I'm going to win.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I'm going to win because it's
fixed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always win.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, that's not why I won,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won because I had, because everybody
entered fuel and everybody entered fruit
[SPEAKER_04]: and I entered fruit fuel and everybody's
purple doesn't get you high.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody's Kush tastes like Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I entered purple weed that gets you
high, tastes like purple, tastes like
[SPEAKER_04]: Kush, tastes like a bunch of other crazy
stuff too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took seven hours to trim three ounces,
you know, and that's just how I did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I didn't touch the weed when I
cut it off the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did all this special stuff and,
you know, it gave me an edge and I just
[SPEAKER_04]: knew the reality was, that's why I put up
the post.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, dude, if you guys really think
that, you know, I'm big headed enough to
[SPEAKER_04]: go in here and think I'm going to win,
you know, I just, I don't believe that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it can be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anybody's going to win.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to win this sucker two years
in a row.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, third, second, first, you know,
I always do pretty well, but it's because
[SPEAKER_04]: of those tricks I use to make my stuff
look unhandled.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know, people's weeds dry in seven
days.
[SPEAKER_04]: My weed ain't dry for 24 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, people's weed is cut down and
put in a wheelbarrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine's cut down and stuck on a hanger.
[SPEAKER_04]: People's weed is touched with hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: I touched the stem.
[SPEAKER_04]: People trim the weed and they put it in a
pile.
[SPEAKER_04]: People pull weed out of bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their trimmers are trimming.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, no, man, this stuff is like,
this is like scientific grade right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's like, these are specimens
of the plant perfectly preserved,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I, I, I, you know, did I think I'd
probably be in the top 10?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I did because I know how much care I
put into those entries, but you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew there was no way I was going to
win.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, that's what the post was about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was, and I was joking.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was tongue in cheek.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was saying, oh yeah, you know,
uh, uh, here's Swami talking to Tim,
[SPEAKER_04]: figuring out how to let me win,
you know, but um, but it was really,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was because, you know, I was making fun
of people who were, who were making fun of
[SPEAKER_04]: me because it, you know, it was just
unrealistic.
[SPEAKER_04]: People basically, if people, um,
if people lose, it's fixed.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they win, it's fair.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how people think, you know,
they're like, well, my friend didn't win,
[SPEAKER_04]: so it's fixed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when their friend wins,
they're like, hell yeah, this is a good
[SPEAKER_04]: contest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause my friend won.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, dude, people's weeds,
not just good cause it's yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's your friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only good if it's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the weed I entered was good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I won.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't mean I can do it every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned that because I was going to
say your online presence in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you don't take any offense to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like semi troll in a lot of
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's like a lot of good jokes
followed up with kind of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, I'm just kidding type of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And no, it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a fun
lover.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm not mean about stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't bully people, but um, you know,
like I said, I like to laugh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to make people laugh.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think like laughing is one of the
greatest things there is.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why, you know, like if,
if people, if people are into the weed
[SPEAKER_04]: community and they don't like to laugh,
like, I don't know what they're smoking,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, just relating to that,
do you think that things in general have
[SPEAKER_02]: gotten a bit uptight and tense in the
community?
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe we could use a bit more of this
kind of just, you know, kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: lighthearted fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's hard to, because everybody's
got a different sense of humor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people take things too far.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people don't know when they're being
a bully.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people don't, they're not really
intelligent enough to actually make a
[SPEAKER_04]: joke.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like a joke.
[SPEAKER_04]: And their joke is just, you know,
calling somebody fat or calling somebody
[SPEAKER_04]: stupid or calling somebody a fag.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they think that's a joke.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like some people just,
they're, they're not, they're,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're, they're missing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, Oh, well you do the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, no, I don't man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I make jokes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, these are jokes, you know,
and a joke might be, yeah, a little over
[SPEAKER_04]: the top and it might, you know,
generally if you see me say something
[SPEAKER_04]: offensive to somebody, that means they're
my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they read it, they know that I,
that I'm joking with them because we have,
[SPEAKER_04]: we, we have a rapport, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people just are just, you know,
trolling strangers and they're just,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I get people on my stuff
sometimes who just come on and go,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and make jokes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, tell mom jokes and they don't
know me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, dude, you know, that's,
you know, you're an idiot.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not, not acceptable.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think as far as like, you know,
like, yeah, as far as like, just like fun
[SPEAKER_04]: loving stuff, I mean, man, this is,
this is, you know, everything's different
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all these people coming in and
they're uptight and they're different
[SPEAKER_04]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: But back in the day, it was like,
if, if somebody smokes weed and they grow
[SPEAKER_04]: weed, you know, they're kind of a smart
ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they're kind of a joker.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of us who are a little more old
school, we can recognize each other and
[SPEAKER_04]: go, yeah, that dude, that dude right
there, he's full of shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's why, you know,
he's funny because he's, he's being funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not, you know, it's just,
it just, I don't know, man, there's
[SPEAKER_04]: different levels to, to, to people's
banter and different stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I, I feel like a lot of
people just, they just basically bully
[SPEAKER_04]: people and they're jerks and they,
you know, people don't know that it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: serious and, you know, it's just out of
context and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's gotta, you know,
it's gotta kind of, you gotta kind of have
[SPEAKER_04]: a context.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mess with anybody who I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, honestly, I, I, you know,
I, I know human nature well enough to be
[SPEAKER_04]: like, no, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna
mess with people who I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to know I'm messing with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, otherwise it's dangerous
and it can be cruel and it just kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: not staying in your own lane, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, talking to, you know, I'm from the
counterculture, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you talk about people, that's like,
you know, that's not cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like snitching, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for me, I, I, I'm not into,
you know, I'm not into being a jerk like
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah, like you said, like,
I'm a little trolly but, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trolling my friends, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I troll round table selections.
[SPEAKER_04]: I troll, you know, I, I, I troll.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I, and we say troll and now it
used to just be called fucking with
[SPEAKER_04]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just messing around.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're having fun, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and that's what I do and I think that
that needs to be like something that hangs
[SPEAKER_04]: around as far as people being able to
laugh at themselves, being able to laugh
[SPEAKER_04]: at stuff that's going on, laugh at
situations, laugh at ideas, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really trying to laugh at people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to laugh at myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to laugh at the joke,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and I think that goes hand in hand
with weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Weed is funny, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Weed makes you giggle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Weed makes you laugh.
[SPEAKER_04]: People look funny when they're high,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: People get high and they look like,
you know, you might have a buddy who gets
[SPEAKER_04]: high and he looks like a tired giraffe or
something, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just like, man, this is,
you know, I think it goes together with
[SPEAKER_04]: the whole thing and I think if that kind
of gets lost and it becomes this,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I see people who are all science
and they're all technique and they're all
[SPEAKER_04]: this and they're all that and I'm like,
man, do you guys smoke this shit or what,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, on the topic of fucking with
friends or maybe just more generally
[SPEAKER_02]: friends, in regards to Freeborn
Selections, would you ever consider doing
[SPEAKER_02]: any collaborative work?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if so, you know, who are the kind of
friends you'd love to jump on board with?
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's like a cool thing about
doing something like that is, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know, like, man, Coastal Seeds,
super cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've already done roundabout stuff with
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bodie, of course, Bodie's just the nicest
guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just super cool dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see, Coastal, Bodie, you know,
Coastal being Bamboo, Mr. Bob,
[SPEAKER_04]: Hannah Bolt, Kagyu, those guys,
they're just, they're really kind of on to
[SPEAKER_04]: like the whole, they understand weed,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, like, let me see,
I, you know, this, every time people get
[SPEAKER_04]: into list, it's like, oh, I'm gonna leave
people out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris at OG, the real OG Cushman at Source
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Kingston at Verify, Verify
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Art at Roundtable Selections.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, I just, I know I'm gonna leave out
half of everybody, but like, these are
[SPEAKER_04]: people who I already kind of work with,
you know, like, I've already, people have
[SPEAKER_04]: already worked with stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Diane Breed has already worked with stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Emerald Mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry if you get a flood of inbox
messages from your friends who are angry.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gonna be like, man, you didn't
give me a shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, I'm just trying to think
of stuff I have going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what do I got going right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course, man, Art's hella cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, Unknown Profit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who else, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, I'm trying to think of like what I'm
growing now that I'm actually probably
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna wind up making something with that I
can just hit them up and go, hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: dude, you know, we wanna do something with
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a good list, to say the least,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a good list.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, man, I really like the people who,
I like the people who go back a little
[SPEAKER_04]: ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the people who are really into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can kind of talk to people and know
that they're into it, not for the scene,
[SPEAKER_04]: but because they're into the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, anybody, man, who's really into
weed, who's chill and who's a smart ass or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever, you know, just like,
man, I know there's a bunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have been probably on my phone
looking at stuff right now so I could tell
[SPEAKER_04]: you.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, you know, I do some work
like with Kevin Jodri up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He pops stuff for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He hooks me up with clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done some stuff with him.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of uh going on, because
that's my brain hitting the wall with all
[SPEAKER_04]: of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll edit it all out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just sound super, super eloquent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super, super slick, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is slick talker.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, man, basically like,
you know, just anybody who's really into
[SPEAKER_04]: doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, most of the people who I
named, it's not because, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: people who I'd like to work with who I
don't name.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people who I did name are people who
we've already done something with or they
[SPEAKER_04]: gave me some stock and said I could work
with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I gave them some stock and said that
they could work with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe they've already made some
crosses or I've already made some crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that, you know, that's the people
kind of that I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's less people who I'd want to work with
and more people who I already do work
[SPEAKER_04]: with, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So as far as people, you know,
who I'd want to work with, of course
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a bunch of them, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, brothers, grand man,
they're super cool people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Geez, just, you know, there's all kinds of
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Duke Diamond, he gave me some
really cool seeds and I'm looking forward
[SPEAKER_04]: to doing something with those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next year I'll probably pop all of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's like a super generous dude who
when I asked him, yeah, can I get a pack
[SPEAKER_04]: of this?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, well, how many would you plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm like, man, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably only like, you know, 35 at a time
or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, oh, cool, I'll give you
like 50 or 75, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can go through them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, shit, okay, right on.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like Bodie, man, I met Bodie
maybe for five minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the next time I saw him, he had a gift
for me for Christmas, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, there's just some, there's some
people, you know, Bamboo Man, super nice
[SPEAKER_04]: guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Kev up there, he always hooks me
up with stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's always looks out for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, all the art, you know,
they're always, it's just people who we're
[SPEAKER_04]: all kind of looking out for each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to see each other do better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we all kind of know where we're coming
from because in the past, everybody was
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of in a, in a certain regard,
as far as like society, we were all kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of like, you know, on the outskirts,
like deemed by society as kind of like
[SPEAKER_04]: being loser potheads, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And now all of a sudden people are like,
oh no, you guys are the, you guys are the
[SPEAKER_05]: best and you guys are good at this and
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad it can turn into something since
I already spent my whole life doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but you know, you can kind of,
you meet those people and you,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know, you know that they're,
that they've been around and they've done
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Swamp Boys, those guys are cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've still never met them,
but you know, I, you know, we troll each
[SPEAKER_04]: other lightly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, you can just tell like
people have been around, they're smart
[SPEAKER_04]: asses.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all kind of on a, on a little level.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all totally different.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: None of us are really, you know,
that's the thing is that's what's the same
[SPEAKER_04]: about us is we're all hella different.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, man, anybody who's, who's really
into doing stuff for the plant sake for
[SPEAKER_04]: itself and not just to, not just to come
up and, and, and look hype, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm interested, you know,
given your kind of, you know, closeness,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put it as with Frenchie through
Holoficionado, has that influenced any of
[SPEAKER_02]: your breeding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, has he ever mentioned anything or
have you ever tried to maybe create
[SPEAKER_02]: something that was more well suited for
kind of, you know, these really high
[SPEAKER_02]: quality hash production methods?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if so, what type of things would you
be looking to do if you were trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: pursue that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's kind of an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Frenchie is cool in that,
you know, he'll take something and he'll
[SPEAKER_04]: make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, he might make a few
different things at once and you get to
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of see, okay, well, this comes out
like this and this comes out like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was making hash for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as soon as I started seeing
people really do it a lot, I kind of got
[SPEAKER_04]: bored with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as I saw people get this really,
really crazy high grade hash, I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, I was just waiting to see that and
they already did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I kind of just stopped doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I really like to give stuff to
people who do take the time to do that,
[SPEAKER_04]: because to me, that's like a whole other
aspect that's kind of like going all into
[SPEAKER_04]: that, where, you know, for me,
it was, you know, I used to make hash,
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to make dry hash, I used to make
water hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, being able to go now and
go, okay, you know, Frenchie, here's some
[SPEAKER_04]: of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he makes it up and it's like,
okay, wow, look at the difference in
[SPEAKER_04]: texture on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this stuff is like liquid.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is water hash, but it's like liquid
or give something to somebody who makes
[SPEAKER_04]: butane extracts, you know, and go,
okay, that does that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at how much terpenes is in this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gives you a little insight into
genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as like steering the breeding,
what's really cool is that I've always
[SPEAKER_04]: bred really for the smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you're breeding for the smoke,
coincidentally, you're breeding for the
[SPEAKER_04]: extract because a plant that doesn't smoke
well, doesn't typically extract well,
[SPEAKER_04]: although I'm sure there's exceptions to it
because some plants don't smoke well
[SPEAKER_04]: because they have a tiny amount of resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once you extract it, the resin might
actually be exceptional.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me, it's been cool with seeing
some stuff that Frenchie does where,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, he makes it and I'm like,
whoa, this stuff just turns into straight
[SPEAKER_04]: liquid or, whoa, this stuff sugars out
really crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, then, you know,
Frenchie's an old school dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, Frenchie's from like the
generation of people who taught me about
[SPEAKER_04]: weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're into different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's into dark pressed hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was making dark pressed hash when I
met him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's into, you know, he's into,
you know, he's different, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's number one, he's older.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two, he's European.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that comes down to, you know,
some different, there's different
[SPEAKER_04]: mindsets.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's looking at different stuff than other
people are looking at.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, and number three, he's Frenchie,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a fucking character.
[SPEAKER_04]: Frenchie's a hilarious dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, he's just like, you know,
he's Frenchie, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a trip.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he's got a lot of charisma.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how do you feel about the topic of
tobacco and cannabis being mixed together?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something we very, very briefly
touched on with Bowie, but it's something
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get into more because I feel
like as time's gone by and there's been an
[SPEAKER_02]: increasing focus on the flavor and the
terpenes of modern cannabis, I feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: tobacco has slowly crept out because it's
almost like it's, a lot of people would
[SPEAKER_02]: argue that it can detract from some of the
natural flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so given there was that focus on
flavor, its usage kind of fell off a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel that's the case?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you feel like it is an overall
negative or maybe it has like its place in
[SPEAKER_02]: the world of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is a trippy one for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a slippery slope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because for years, all right, I never
smoked, I never smoked tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a tobacco smoker.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like, you know, some people are
like, oh, I'm 15.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm smoking cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I didn't ever smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_04]: My mom smoked a little when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hated the smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was never into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, I think maybe we had
a, we got a friend and he, in his dad is,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, Spanish.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had one of these accents where he lives
in like three countries in Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't really pin down his accent
really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like Italian, Spanish and something
else, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was like one of these kind of,
one of these old school hardcore dudes.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was, he was a, he was an outlaw,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he would, he would, we saw him when we
were smoking when I was like 15 or
[SPEAKER_04]: something, you know, 14 and we were really
getting smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: We saw that over there at their house,
they would smoke with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we never really, we never really did
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, I was, I was a dude
who, you know, like I took mushrooms for
[SPEAKER_04]: the first time, man, when I was at like 12
years old at school, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, I'm like, I was like a cosmonaut
at one point, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, one time my buddy,
C Money, he goes, hey, let's roll one up,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's roll one up like those guys down
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes, I'm gonna take a little bit of
tobacco and a little bit of weed and then
[SPEAKER_04]: we're gonna put a little bit of hash and a
little bit of keif in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And man, we lit it up and I think we each
maybe took like four hits and we were so
[SPEAKER_04]: gone we couldn't believe it because we had
never experienced nicotine before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you're not a nicotine user,
it's a really, really intense drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the strongest drugs there is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gives you a really heavy, heavy,
heavy rush in the face and it makes your
[SPEAKER_04]: feet feel light.
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of feel like a spaceman.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was really neat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think it was all the way,
maybe two or three years later,
[SPEAKER_04]: one of my closest friends, man,
a guy named Moise, he was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, let's smoke this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got this Jamaican tobacco, it's called
Fronto, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, oh yeah, and he goes,
yeah, you put it in a bong a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: with some weed, man, it gets you super
high.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like nitrous or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, oh, okay, crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I was like, all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I tried it and I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh my God, this is like
smoking that tobacco, but this is way more
[SPEAKER_04]: intense.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was kind of my experience with it,
but I was always anti-tobacco,
[SPEAKER_04]: like I said, I don't like the smell,
I don't like the fact that I knew a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: smokers who got cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to say it was definitely tobacco,
but of course they're smoking this big
[SPEAKER_04]: tobacco products that aren't probably even
anywhere near as good for you,
[SPEAKER_04]: considering there's like 800 additives,
a lot different than smoking a plant
[SPEAKER_04]: that's growing in the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so then I think it was maybe about
2006.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hanging out with Moise and he's always
smoking Blend.
[SPEAKER_04]: We call him Mo Blend, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Blend, Blend, he's smoking Blends,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's rolling these big Bob Marley cones
all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm always like, man, roll up a
Ital, roll up one with no tobacco,
[SPEAKER_04]: just roll one with weed, roll one with
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, no, man, I want to smoke a
Blend.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm like, all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So after a while I'm like, man,
screw it, let me hit the Blend.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I start hitting the Blend and after a
while I get this real, just like,
[SPEAKER_04]: man, hard to describe, just this feeling
of well-being and not the edge that the
[SPEAKER_04]: heavy weed would give me where I'd get the
little bit of unexplainable paranoia a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so after a while, yeah, I started
smoking, man, I started smoking Blends.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so from 2007 maybe until probably
2000, geez, 2007 to maybe 2010 or
[SPEAKER_04]: something, I smoked Blends.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was interesting was I was
breeding at the time and I don't want to,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I don't condone smoking tobacco
in any way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody who's listening to it,
you know, that's why I said it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: slippery slope.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's very few strains that the terpene
profile can cut through tobacco and
[SPEAKER_04]: there's very few strains that when you are
in nicotine, will boost the effect of the
[SPEAKER_04]: nicotine to a point of giving you a really
heavy head rush even when you smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: tobacco fairly often.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those strains are the really heavy
duty ones that are the very best weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you have a plant and you're a
Blend smoker and it's good in a Blend,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's the best weed, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't, you know, it's one of those
weird things it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like, you know, like a badass jazz
dude like Bird who shoots heroin telling
[SPEAKER_04]: you not to do heroin, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's not the tobacco that helps
you breed, but you know, I can't really
[SPEAKER_04]: say that it didn't help me to develop a
couple of strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, black lime and root beer were
the two strains that no matter what,
[SPEAKER_04]: you could always put them in a Blend and
they would launch you straight to the moon
[SPEAKER_04]: every time and then you try some other
stuff and it just didn't work,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like they're the ones that
really work that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, I can say, you know,
if anybody is going to smoke tobacco,
[SPEAKER_04]: don't smoke any of that big tobacco stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smoke, grow a plant, learn how to dry it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I used to smoke, I know it's big
tobacco still, you know, but me and Moise
[SPEAKER_04]: would smoke American Spirit and at least
it doesn't have the additives in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably still pretty nasty just from
how they grow it, but you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a plant, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, I think it's really got a
bad rap because people use it wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked to my doctor about how I was
smoking Blends and he was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, you know, that's not really a
tobacco user who usually falls under the
[SPEAKER_04]: statistics of people who are going to be
really unhealthy for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're smoking a lot more tobacco than
you're talking about right now,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, I just wound up quitting
because I can tell you it is hard on your
[SPEAKER_04]: lungs, but my lungs do feel like they felt
before I ever smoked tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they do feel like they've come
back to being totally normal again,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you know, I couldn't breathe as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't do as good like trying to run
away in the woods or anything like that
[SPEAKER_04]: when I was smoking tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it is dangerous and it is
harmful, but that doesn't mean that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: dangerous or harmful to take a puff of it
here or there or, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely, it's definitely a trippy
subject and, you know, they're,
[SPEAKER_04]: man, there's tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got this tobacco, I got this tobacco
back in the day and this guy gave it to me
[SPEAKER_04]: and he said, oh, do you blend?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes, oh, just put a little of this
in there and I took it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took it home and I put it in the bong
and I smoked it in the bong and what
[SPEAKER_04]: happened was I woke up, you know,
45 seconds later on the ground asking for
[SPEAKER_04]: a towel, laughing and crying because,
you know, I had snot coming out my nose
[SPEAKER_04]: and I had drool running down my face and I
was laying on the carpet like I was doing
[SPEAKER_04]: snow angels and, you know, I couldn't
breathe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't believe it and what that was,
that was the, you know, the old stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the rustica and that's the
original thick leaf Indian tobacco that's,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, basically for a medicine man to
smoke, you know, or kind of what they,
[SPEAKER_04]: really what they would smoke when you see
people smoking, you know, in a peace pipe
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this thick, hardcore tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like if tobacco is like paper,
it's almost like cardboard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you smoke that, that's not like
smoking a cigarette, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like, you know, it's like something
you'd see in a movie.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's somebody, you know, it looked like
somebody must have blew ayahuasca up my
[SPEAKER_04]: nose or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, that's my experience with
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: If people are smoking it now, every once
in a while I might smoke a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't quit in the way that I went.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm quitting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just quit in the way that I just didn't
smoke it anymore, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: I never got smoking it with weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I didn't get addicted like
other people got addicted to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if there's something to that
or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really strong willed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was able to just smoke tobacco every
day, all day for years and then just quit
[SPEAKER_04]: in a day cold turkey.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did that a couple times.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started smoking again after another year
or whatever and then I just quit again
[SPEAKER_04]: cold turkey, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure a lot of people wish they could
do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think a lot of it, you know,
I was talking to to an old school friend
[SPEAKER_04]: of mine and he said, you know,
he used to smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: He used to smoke some big name tobacco
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when he would quit, he would get
terrible headaches and he would feel
[SPEAKER_04]: really bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he started smoking American
spirit and he smoked just as much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when he would quit, he wouldn't
get the headaches.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he wouldn't be that bad to quit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he associated it with the additives.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he believes that the additives are
more addictive than the actual nicotine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I don't know the anecdotal
evidence, but he felt that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think that's very much, very much
true because a lot of people I know who
[SPEAKER_02]: have tried to use the nicotine type vape
pens say it's nowhere near as gratifying
[SPEAKER_02]: as an actual an actual cigarette.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that should automatically show that,
yeah, like a lot of the other chemicals
[SPEAKER_02]: plus also there's studies that show that
like organically grown tobacco,
[SPEAKER_02]: like non-big stuff, the chance of it
giving you cancer is greatly diminished
[SPEAKER_02]: because all the additives are far more
carcinogenic than the actual tobacco plant
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I can believe it,
you know, and we know there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: those additives and we know that those
additives are related to addictive
[SPEAKER_04]: addiction and health problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of the studies done on tobacco
are done on, they're done on that tobacco,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're not done on pure tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really hard to pin down what is
really the problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you for sure that smoking my
own tobacco that I grow, it's still really
[SPEAKER_04]: bad for your lungs and it's still really
hard on your respiratory system and
[SPEAKER_04]: everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I feel like there's,
I feel like, you know, it's definitely a
[SPEAKER_04]: step up from smoking all that other nasty
stuff they put in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I mean, if we just to take a step
back and take a more macro view of the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole scene, I've heard a few people
describe breeding in general as falling
[SPEAKER_02]: into kind of two categories at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've kind of got, you know, your new
school breeders who are, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: running with, you know, your dosy does and
your girl scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's got its own merit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you've got the other camp,
which is more looking to delve into the
[SPEAKER_02]: older work, preservation work,
land raise, or just working in that
[SPEAKER_02]: general direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think this trend will continue?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if so, do you think the divide will
get bigger between the two schools?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because already I can see that it seems to
be becoming more and more present.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like more breeders are becoming more kind
of known for working with that old school
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff and less for working with the new
school stuff and vice versa for their
[SPEAKER_02]: counterparts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's an interesting thing,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that they both have their place.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the kind of the new school
mindset is what it kind of takes things in
[SPEAKER_04]: that bottleneck direction of things being
narrowed down to these things that
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone can kind of agree are,
you know, good in the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bag appeal, the general, like it's a
crowd pleaser kind of effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then, you know, I think it's very,
very important for people to keep those
[SPEAKER_04]: old genetics around because that's where
everything came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people tend to think of that in a
vague sense, like, you know, well,
[SPEAKER_04]: girl scout cookies, you know, 40 years
ago, you know, there was things that
[SPEAKER_04]: turned into other things that turned into
these things that turned into cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like when I smell cookies,
it's like I said, it's it's an Afghani to
[SPEAKER_04]: me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has a little something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you love cookies, you might be able
to go grab a Landrace Paki or a Landrace
[SPEAKER_04]: Afi and go, OK, well, here's that same
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it turns out it didn't take a whole
lot of work to arrive at this place where
[SPEAKER_04]: this stuff is here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people think of like Landrace and
heirloom and old school as being like this
[SPEAKER_04]: far off thing from our modern day weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in reality, you can take a lot of
those old seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you could go back and get seeds
in 1900 or 1850.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, if you still had those and
they were viable or you had a time machine
[SPEAKER_04]: or whatever, you could pop them now and
you'd go, whoa, look, it's the next OG or
[SPEAKER_04]: it's the next whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've never really been sold on this
whole concept.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of people doing these crazy hybrids that
all of a sudden give you these new things
[SPEAKER_04]: that were unheard of in the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the old genetics really have
them right there, just either just under
[SPEAKER_04]: the surface or just right there in the
same population.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that nobody grows anything,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody grows the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're thinking like, OK, well,
I'm going to use this because it's the hot
[SPEAKER_04]: thing and not going back and going,
well, hey, dude, did you ever think that's
[SPEAKER_04]: why I'm excited to see what Bodhi is doing
right now in Coastal because they're going
[SPEAKER_04]: back into the old stuff to make new stuff
that I think in the long term is going to
[SPEAKER_04]: wind up being there's going to be some
stuff that comes out of there that's the
[SPEAKER_04]: new stuff because there's no one else
doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, it's just basically
regurgitating other people's work.
[SPEAKER_04]: As it's like, you know, people make a
cookies cross and they're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: look how resinous it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, wasn't cookies resinous,
though?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, did anything new happen here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we just kind of doing this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like it's like music, you know,
and everyone's doing down by the boardwalk
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's just down by the boardwalk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, sold records, but isn't this
just down by the boardwalk?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I respect it both, but I really think
that the modern guys really need to
[SPEAKER_04]: understand what the modern stuff is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a good clone or a good cross of
something people have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really want to see people dig in and
find all the old stuff before it's just
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't exist anymore, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, with that in mind, what old school
gems have you got in the works for us?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because you're known as someone
who has, you know, from time to time
[SPEAKER_02]: delved into their bag of goodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, Bodhi even hinted at it saying
that he likes, he likes all the old stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: you pull out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything on the horizon you may be
thinking about popping, maybe some new
[SPEAKER_02]: schools, some old school stuff going to be
coming back.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I got a really, really neat
collection of stuff that I totally did not
[SPEAKER_04]: understand how neat it was because at the
time it was just like these crosses of
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff people had given me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, well, I made the cross,
but I'll just get back the pure one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I didn't store them right because
I didn't want to grow them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody wanted to grow them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, I just, I knew like,
I knew how to store seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew that I should.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and I was just like, yeah,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, I basically thought my stuff was
trash because I was seeing other stuff or
[SPEAKER_04]: the stuff that it had come from that was,
you know, either more consistent or
[SPEAKER_04]: more marketable or whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just the thing of when things are
too close to you, it's hard to see them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to see the big picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you're used to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the, you know, like I tell
everybody, whatever you smoke all the
[SPEAKER_04]: time, that's the Reggie.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's regs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like if you have it,
then you're going to think it's regs.
[SPEAKER_04]: People who only grow OG are like,
some of them still like it, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: them are like, I kind of want to try
something new because this is just OG now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they first got it, it was like,
oh my God, I got OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they're like, yeah, OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same old flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, that's how it was with the
seeds that I had.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it would be like, oh,
this one's prone to PM or this one likes
[SPEAKER_04]: to mold or this one doesn't get tall
enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you make the hybrids and the
hybrids better.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't plant the old seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, man, I got some seeds that
basically are still viable because I'm not
[SPEAKER_04]: saying I like stored them in the attic in
the heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: They came up for 10 years, but then all of
a sudden I hit like 12 years and they
[SPEAKER_04]: wouldn't come up anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: They sprout a tail, but they won't come
out of the dirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I basically need to link up with
somebody who, and I have a couple of leads
[SPEAKER_04]: right now who can do the tissue culture
where they either do the seeds and test
[SPEAKER_04]: tubes with the plant version of
antibiotics that prevent everything from
[SPEAKER_04]: attacking the seeds and forming bacterial
colonies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And stuff while they're trying to sprout
and that give them a little extra
[SPEAKER_04]: carbohydrates to replenish their stores
and hormones to really make them want to
[SPEAKER_04]: grow faster so that they can really get
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's another way you can do it
where you can actually cut the seed open,
[SPEAKER_04]: get inside the germ, get viable cells and
grow them out as a callus in a Petri dish.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can add hormones to make
those effective become basically like
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds or you can also encase the cells
through a process where you make like
[SPEAKER_04]: artificial seeds and that's another way to
bring stuff back.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is practical.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been used for other stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have to find the right way to do
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And man, I have some really neat stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the original F1 pollinations that
were the original black line.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the old dirt per mark that I made,
you know, stuff from 99, 2000,
[SPEAKER_04]: 2001.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have all this old stuff and I have like
a thousand of each and they're totally
[SPEAKER_04]: viable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just afraid to risk losing genetics
out of them by trying to pop a bunch only
[SPEAKER_04]: to get a few when I know that in a
laboratory they can come back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's one aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other aspect of it is that I've been
asking around too for people and saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: hey, you know, what do you guys got?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's got old seed still?
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are some people and some people
don't want to part with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people don't want to share them even
though they have plenty.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, all those, I totally
understand where people are coming from on
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like recently I scored this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you saw the post that was
the Santa Marta Indica red vein.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see those little plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually looking at them now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those ones there are really special
one, you know, I'm talking to the guy and
[SPEAKER_04]: he's like, yeah, 1977 or 78, I get the
Santa Marta gold and I'm growing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in 1980, I go to the bar and these
guys smoked the best joint I've ever
[SPEAKER_04]: tasted with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're, they're like, he's like,
what is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, oh, it's called Indica.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they give him like five seeds and
he crosses that with a Santa Marta.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, a few years,
five years later, six years later,
[SPEAKER_04]: something he puts in the stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like what I call the perp that he
called the red vein.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the stocks get really red.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, you see it like in DJ
shorts, blueberry, except instead of like,
[SPEAKER_04]: instead of the purple of it, it's like
red.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, I think it's different than what I
call perp, but it's that same look of the,
[SPEAKER_04]: where the stems have color instead of
being green.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's what's in my black lime,
honestly, cause it came from the same
[SPEAKER_04]: area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really interesting cause there's
these, all these old things you get and
[SPEAKER_04]: people tell you the story, but they only
have the story they have.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like I can't say without a doubt
that everything is only what is in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just know those things are in it for
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because back in the day it's
like, Oh, this is so and so stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you ask him what it is and he
goes, Oh, it's Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you talk to him years later and he
goes, Oh no, it's Afghani in Burmese,
[SPEAKER_04]: the Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you go, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just behaves like an Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he called it an Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd know what it was cause he thought
I'm just going to grow them and grow dope.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, people don't know you have
interest in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's all these old things that are
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's what I'm trying to track
back down, you know, but that strain,
[SPEAKER_04]: that particular strain, you know,
he's like, yeah, test it 25% THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes, I call it lemon Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, there's other people who have
stuff called lemon Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, well, name it for me,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then people will know what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, dude, you know, I'm on
social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm able to show people stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's, I know it's going to be
the bomb because this guy, he's this old,
[SPEAKER_04]: old school dude who's like an old school,
you know, rock star party animal,
[SPEAKER_04]: bad-ass dude from the area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, you know, he's, I don't know how
old he is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to date him as being older
than he is, but you know, he's like my
[SPEAKER_04]: mom, he's like 60 or something,
you know, maybe older, maybe a little
[SPEAKER_04]: younger, but he, he was a, you know,
he was around growing dope to get seeds in
[SPEAKER_04]: the seventies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he didn't ever go, he didn't ever do
what I did with a lot of my stuff and go,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm going to cross this with OG or I'm
going to cross this with diesel or I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: going to cross this with Urkel or I'm
going to cross this with whatever these
[SPEAKER_04]: clones are that came floating around that
everyone wanted.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you try to make things be
happening for the time, for the market,
[SPEAKER_04]: for the people who want to grow the seeds
and, and, and be able to get, and be able
[SPEAKER_04]: to have a reference, you know,
like people want to be able to tell
[SPEAKER_04]: people, Oh, it's an OG cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they, now people know what to make of
it when they show it to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's old pure stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not pure, of course it's
still a three way cross, but it's a three
[SPEAKER_04]: way cross of strains that were around in
the seventies and the early eighties and
[SPEAKER_04]: he's never changed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's still tests at 25% THC and it's
super resilient and it gets huge yields
[SPEAKER_04]: and the weeds, the shit you smell the
stem, it smells like gummy worms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's starting to develop into like
a lemon peel smell, not like a,
[SPEAKER_04]: not like a lemony, like what people call
lemon and weed generally, but like real
[SPEAKER_04]: lemon peel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's exciting to see when they were
tiny little, tiny little sprouts,
[SPEAKER_04]: they had more resin than anything else in
the greenhouse out of a whole,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like five big tables full of a
six inch pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an exciting one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something that I'm doing something
with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I asked him, I'm like, dude,
do you know, do I need to like keep this
[SPEAKER_04]: tied or what?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's all no, dude, blow it up,
popularize it, put it out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, so, yeah, so that's one of
those ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, so, you know, I've been trying
to find things that are like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, for me, like a lot of
my stuff, it's just worked poly hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I made these poly hybrids and then I
bred them in directions and now they're
[SPEAKER_04]: real strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they could have been, they're like
something you could have got from someone
[SPEAKER_04]: back in the day that was a real strain,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as a lot of the stuff that went
into them, it's not, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not viable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now these, these new true breeding
hybrids that I have, they're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, that's where all the stuff is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, I like the new ones better
than the old ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, I value the old ones because
they had other ways I could have gone with
[SPEAKER_04]: them, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think this brings us to the last
little bit where we just got a few little
[SPEAKER_02]: quick fire questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shall we blast through them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first one, what's your favorite strain
of all time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, I really liked this old school stuff
that we thought was garlic bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it was or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: It came through the hog farm in the mid
nineties.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just the most amazing like
definition of a broadleaf Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: The weed was completely solid white.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was purple on the very inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bud actually was mostly like colorless
because it was so dense that light didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: get in through the outside of the bud
after like a couple weeks in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never got to grow it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grimps grapes was incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pissy pungent favorito probably to this
day is one right up there with my
[SPEAKER_04]: favorites.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as something that like this is
still around, like what, like what's my
[SPEAKER_04]: favorite smoke?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's my, you know, like if I had to only
have one thing, probably something out of
[SPEAKER_04]: the black lime.
[SPEAKER_04]: The black lime is for me, that's like
just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's when I smoke a lot, that's what I
want to smoke, black lime, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Solid answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's one strain that you used to
have, but you've lost and you wish you
[SPEAKER_02]: could get it back?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see, like a seed strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really liked the black Afghani that I
had.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really neat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have a bunch of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just don't quite come up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was a neat one that I lost that I
really kind of am like, darn it,
[SPEAKER_04]: I lost it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, man, the old, my old Northern
Lights clone, as far as a clone,
[SPEAKER_04]: that was, that was really one that I just
am bummed about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can already tell you brought it up
twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must've been special.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it was, it's, it's a lot of what the
black lime is, is that clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you were just a grower and you could
only have one pack of seeds, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: currently on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one pack would you go with?
[SPEAKER_02]: One pack of seeds.
Geez.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I haven't grown a lot of
people's seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's a lot of people's seeds who
I might, you know, if I had that,
[SPEAKER_04]: if I had their stuff, I might throw mine
away, but I, you know, I haven't done a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of them and out of everything I've
seen, I still, I mean, I'd have to say
[SPEAKER_04]: probably like, you know, my lime one clone
with, with something from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just lime cross lime.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but as far as like from other
breeders, dude, I just don't, I don't have
[SPEAKER_04]: much reference.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't grown a lot of stuff from
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, um, it's kind of a loaded question
in that I'm going to say something from me
[SPEAKER_04]: because I'm so, I'm just not that
experienced with seed packs, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure, I'm sure many people would have
picked your lime cross as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could go back to one place,
in history and time to collect seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: what would they be and where?
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, for me, I think I'd probably have to
say like, go back like probably to like
[SPEAKER_04]: the fifties and then go in the Hindu Kush
region and, um, you know, collect,
[SPEAKER_04]: collect everything there that was like
what I know what I saw here when I was
[SPEAKER_04]: growing up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that's the genetics, you know,
it was basically the Afghani before it
[SPEAKER_04]: got, before it got messed around with by
outside stuff and, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, back before anybody really brought
anything over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so final question, which person or
groups do you hold kind of in the highest
[SPEAKER_02]: regard for the overall progression of
cannabis throughout time?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, um, man, hippies for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to put hippies up there because,
um, that's where, you know, a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: happened in that part of the
counterculture coming from the,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the sixties and the seventies
and all those people going through the
[SPEAKER_04]: eighties and the nineties and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but, you know, other than that,
I'd say, you know, like, um, I really
[SPEAKER_04]: think there's not enough value placed on a
lot of what people think of as land race
[SPEAKER_04]: in a lot of cases is from places where the
weed doesn't have to be tended very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people don't really know that people
are, are influencing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in places like Afghanistan and
Thailand and India and Africa,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there was a lot of people,
um, who were, uh, actually making
[SPEAKER_04]: selections in the field, um, and choosing
which seeds got planted over others and
[SPEAKER_04]: cutting plants they didn't like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that, um, I think a lot of the
land race stuff was actually being bred in
[SPEAKER_04]: a sense, although, you know, it's a land
race cause it's wild, but I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: times it's, it's wild because people don't
have to grow it, but they're still
[SPEAKER_04]: influencing the genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, basically the hippies and
all the, you know, those, those,
[SPEAKER_04]: those, you know, kind of counterculture
people and, um, you know, not to get too
[SPEAKER_04]: specific, basically just to kind of say,
yeah, just like people who were like,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, we're going to smoke dope and hang
out and have a good time and enjoy life
[SPEAKER_04]: and nature and the mountains and,
you know, and then the, the, those early
[SPEAKER_04]: people who kind of get left out of the
story, like people are like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was just good though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good weed was just good in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just good in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people influenced that,
you know, to keep it from being hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, I think those, you know,
those ain't more ancient and traditional
[SPEAKER_04]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then these more modern back to the
earth types who moved up into the Hills
[SPEAKER_04]: and Santa Cruz and the Sierras and
Humboldt and Trinity and Mendo and stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I think they kind of,
they shaped how everything is now,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, dead heads and hippies.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, without, without dead heads,
especially, I think, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, for sure, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks so much for coming on the show
and for dropping all that knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have any comments or shout outs
you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, I, um, man, we, we,
we went through so much material right
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I feel like, uh, I feel like we
touched on a lot of stuff and,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, you know, it's the same like,
you know, I can give shout outs right now,
[SPEAKER_04]: but of course I'm going to space out a
whole bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so probably better to just,
uh, shout out everyone, just shout out
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody, you know, everybody that,
um, everybody that, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: is, is, uh, interested in weed and,
you know, all my, all my, my old school
[SPEAKER_04]: friends and my new friends and my family
and, uh, you know, my sons and my kids
[SPEAKER_04]: and, uh, my lady and, um, yeah,
