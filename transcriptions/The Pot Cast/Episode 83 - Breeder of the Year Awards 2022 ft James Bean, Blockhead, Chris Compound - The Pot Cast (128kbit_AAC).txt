[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I'm joined as usual by

[SPEAKER_01]: the Year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who have you picked?
[SPEAKER_01]: Write some ideas down.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if you agree with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alrighty, friends, we're back for another
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as usual, we're joined by the man with
his feet on the ground in the industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. James Bean for our Breeder Awards of
2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, thanks for having me again.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good to be back on the show for
another year down, another year down,
[SPEAKER_05]: another year in the books.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to say we've had a quick one or
should I say probably about eight months.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's been a little truncated because
we did last year's one a little bit late,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I decided, you know, get us back on
track.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do this one a little bit early.
[SPEAKER_01]: But needless to say, we've had a few
notable changes going down in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen a few breeders come,
a few go, a few incarnated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be an interesting awards,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's been going on for you, Mr. Bean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking about that as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking, you know, when we were
talking about Breeder of the Year and
[SPEAKER_05]: whatnot, I was like, huh, this name has
been up there the last two years.
[SPEAKER_05]: This name has been non-existent in the
last couple of months.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder what's going on with that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll definitely talk about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just, you know, I think the whole
industry on the whole is down or I think
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe possibly the seed sales are down a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: This year, over a year over a year,
people got out of their houses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we had two bigger years,
2021, but people actually got out of their
[SPEAKER_05]: houses, got to moving around.
[SPEAKER_05]: So sales are a little bit down,
but we actually made our sales even
[SPEAKER_05]: better, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Even better deals for everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this might be a good point to
review some of our predictions and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: our results from last year, because we
haven't done that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'll be good to sort of check in
and see if they stand the test of time,
[SPEAKER_01]: albeit 8 to 12 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first award from last year we'll
check in was the Clone of the Year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We gave it to Apple Fritter.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: You still stand by it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, still thinking.
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to look back and know now that you
know and not think about that and compare
[SPEAKER_05]: it like, oh, we didn't know about this one
back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Apple Fritter, definitely, I think it
was good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was a solid pick, you know,
for sure, because it wasn't the recent
[SPEAKER_05]: apples, but I think it definitely started
up the apples, the apples phase trend,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something that I was very happy to see
was that it hasn't been adopted by
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely everyone in their breeding
projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not completely oversaturated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it still definitely stands the
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, shout out to LumpStatus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cool one for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the flower is really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it used in a lot of projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing I wanted to mention,
though, was when I asked you last year
[SPEAKER_01]: about the Clone of the Year, your guess
was the jealousy from JBZ.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Leafley's just come out and called it
their Strain of the Year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's interesting is we sort of made
this same point around three years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: when we first predicted the upsurge of
runts when it came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what do you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Leafley's Strain of the Year the following
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess at this point, it's safe to say
we're not doing too bad on the old betting
[SPEAKER_01]: odds, are we?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think if I was a betting man,
which I generally am, I do play the
[SPEAKER_05]: cryptos.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would definitely put our money on us to
pick it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, not to blow my own horn
here, but when you're in the industry and
[SPEAKER_05]: you're in the seed business, you're in the
seed game, you see what's coming in and
[SPEAKER_05]: day in and day out and see all the new
strains and what's on the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's kind of it's humbling and
it's cool to be able to hit things on the
[SPEAKER_05]: head sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we move on and we look at our hottest
newcomer, we had Bloom Seedco really
[SPEAKER_01]: solidifying himself as, you know,
in that tier one breeder list nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can definitely get behind that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Bloom's sort of gone from strength
to strength now doing some co-labs with
[SPEAKER_01]: Boston Roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just had what was his Maple,
Maple... Oh, the Black Maple hybrids?
[SPEAKER_05]: Black Maple, yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: That had that line release.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just sold the last pack of those the other
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were hot commodity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely a big pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He likes fast cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got some nice parts on his Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Bloom for that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of our most anticipated seed drop
last year, we had Crickets and Cicada,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Bob and Hanna-Bolt with their puck
back cross one line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's safe to say we can stand by
that one pretty firmly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a given.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: He happens to be in the running for this
year with his BC3, in fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they've gone from strength to
strength.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, at least for me, that was a hot one
for this year for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost shut my website down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of our Hall of Fame strain,
we had Blueberry from DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it needs too much said
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly, Hall of Fame.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hall of Fame worthy strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, everybody's smoked Blueberry
growing up, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they had it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if it wasn't the true Blueberry,
you were given a bag and it was told he
[SPEAKER_05]: was Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it smelled like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It may smell like hay sometimes,
and it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was clearly Beasters, but they told you
it was Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was one of the first knocked off
strain, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, gosh, must be knocked off more than
basically anything, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you guys ever have Beasters over in
Australia?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking about Beasters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we got the equivalent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it later came out to be like M38
or M27 or something from Canada,
[SPEAKER_05]: but horrible, horrible weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, M39 or whatever, that skunk cross
and fast flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also gave a lifetime
achievement award to Mel Frank for all of
[SPEAKER_01]: his work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, again, that one stands the
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking back, pretty happy with those
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we've got egg on our face in
any real meaningful regards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's move on to the awards for this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always like to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not always, but last year, I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I listened to the episode before this,
so it's just fresh in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, we started with Clone of the
Year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's a good place to start
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do some honorable mentions before we
actually announce the winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, I want to start out by giving
an honorable mention to something that I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't think many people will expect,
which is that I want to give an honorable
[SPEAKER_01]: mention to RS-11, bred by Deep East,
an undeniably popular commercial strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Doja Crew has rep this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've done super well with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on the record of saying that the
clone drop was the most successful in
[SPEAKER_01]: history.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they said it was like one and a
half million or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It beat Jay Beese's Jealousy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a beautiful flavor that really
sort of incorporates the best aspects of
[SPEAKER_01]: the parents, being the Pink Guava and the
Ozzy Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I want to give an honorable
mention to the Rainbow Sherb 11,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, super popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out, Deep East.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I first saw that strain come across
the list, I thought it was Roadkill Skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, somebody's got a Roadkill
Skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: How dare they?
[SPEAKER_05]: How dare they?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I saw Gromar working with the
Thug Buck.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had a drop this year with the PBX.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had the RS, and I was like,
he's got a Roadkill Skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh no, it's a Rainbow Sherb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, good strain, though, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen that everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Exotic's got it coming up,
and a lot of people have even been using
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was Roadkill Skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, fairly not.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, look, I can understand the confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, a shout out to the Doja Crew and
all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another honorable mention I want to give
is to Archive Fletcher for the Rainbow
[SPEAKER_01]: Belts 3.0, the next installment in the
Rainbow Belts series from Archive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people are still infatuated and in
love with the flavor of the Rainbow Belts,
[SPEAKER_01]: and for good reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very terpy with a little something
special on top of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're into that Skittles dimension
of flavor, this has got that plus more,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as super aesthetic, a very popular
clone and seed release.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Archive for the Rainbow Belts
3.0.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had people calling me.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, hey, you got any Rainbow
Belts in your safe?
[SPEAKER_05]: You got any Rainbow Belts?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, no, why?
[SPEAKER_05]: I want those.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, oh man, I need it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So definitely Fletcher always comes
correct with Sirius Strange.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been in the game longer than most
people I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely does it for the right reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's one of those guys that has a,
he's got a rec license so he can run the
[SPEAKER_05]: numbers, find what he wants to run,
find what's good, find what works for him,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then rest on the shelf, so to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the final honorable mention I
want to give is to none other than Boston
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots for the Sherbanger clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one has started to make its way into
many more gardens after being held for a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's been used by many and he's got
some notable co-labs going down with the
[SPEAKER_01]: likes of Bloom, which we've already
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Boston Roots for his
Sherbanger.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to give a couple of shots out real
quick, at least one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be for Exotic and his work
with the Gary Poppins, which is the Gary
[SPEAKER_05]: Payton crossed with Red Pop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I had seen that one do well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we sold a whole bunch of that,
maybe four or 500 packs of that thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was a hot, hot commodity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, he had this year, he also had his
Red Runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people in Australia harvesting
that and it looks great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only have they bought it,
I've seen the flower on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Exotic Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get to the winner this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The winner is... Clone only of the year
goes to none other than Apples and Bananas
[SPEAKER_01]: from Chris Compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apples and Bananas has undeniably been the
biggest clone of the year for the 2022
[SPEAKER_01]: period, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have seen a number of breeders,
not just Chris, using it in their
[SPEAKER_01]: projects, not just as female acceptors,
but also even other people reversing it
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves like Raw and Lit Farms,
just to name a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got an undeniable nose that has the
ability to dominate any bag it's in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seriously reminds me of that sort of
tangy thing where it just fully cuts
[SPEAKER_01]: through the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bud structure, in my opinion,
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That spiraling, calic sort of pyramidal or
fractal looking structure, I really like
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The high is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Composed of some interesting genetics,
now and laters, crossed to Gelati.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one I find particularly interesting
because it utilizes some unique work from
[SPEAKER_01]: Sin City.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who yet again have proven themselves as
the breeders breeder, with their work also
[SPEAKER_01]: notably appearing in Jay Beese's Wedding
Cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Apples and Bananas is hot in every
dispensary you go to, especially Cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not surprising, given Chris helped curate
their menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you'll find it in many of the exotic
style brands, pushing it for good reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really high quality bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of people growing with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of people breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts, Mr. Bean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Agree?
[SPEAKER_01]: Disagree?
[SPEAKER_05]: Agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Apples and Bananas was huge last year in
2022.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a big strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw it coming at the end of the Emerald
Cup with the big lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Emerald Cup went with Chris down
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That whole kind of snap through that
happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, Chris is no longer with
Compound now.
[SPEAKER_05]: He and them split ways at the beginning of
this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: He put a post out.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's now Cypher Genetics, which you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Apples and Bananas, it was money.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cross on it, I've got it as I've
just got the full thing written out on my
[SPEAKER_05]: website.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just like, it's not such a joke.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got it as four, which is Platinum
Cookies, Granddaddy Purple, that cross,
[SPEAKER_05]: the blue power, which gives us now and
later is that cross back to Slotty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that Platinum Cookies, Granddaddy
Purple, that's incorrect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: But instead of saying that, they should
say what it actually is, which is it's
[SPEAKER_01]: Candyland.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what Platinum Cookies, Granddaddy
Purple is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the most interesting part,
which I mentioned before, is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yet again, Sin City sneaking their work
into one of the hottest strains utilized
[SPEAKER_01]: by another big breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Don's a great dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've known him since 2014, probably hooked
up with him at Denver Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: We sell a lot of his gear.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Sin City Saturdays, 20% off down
stock, but he's been putting out a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: good work for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: He usually always does merch with each
release and tests his work and does a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of solid stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Agree?
[SPEAKER_01]: Disagree?
[SPEAKER_01]: Apples and bananas?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you already answered it,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I just too stoned right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, you answered it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was the hottest strain last
year for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, we saw it coming through the
end of the Emerald Cup, the lines,
[SPEAKER_05]: the people and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, it's also just for the entry
books, it's odd how that cut was out
[SPEAKER_05]: before he even did the seed release.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, because I got to deal with
the cool people over that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not being the real deal and it was a real
deal and just a whole bunch of problems
[SPEAKER_05]: there with that whole.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if that good story makes a great
strain, they say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I strongly suspect that the cut
getting out before the seed drop happened
[SPEAKER_01]: is maybe one of the factors that led to
Chris's ultimate split from compound.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if I was, you know, just let's say
I was a breeder working with a tissue
[SPEAKER_05]: culture lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hypothetically, if somehow my cuts started
to get out and I didn't give them to
[SPEAKER_05]: anyone, I would be pissed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would, you know, you got to figure out,
you got to start going backwards and be
[SPEAKER_05]: like, well, if I didn't give them out,
how the hell did they get out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, on to our next award.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do the hottest newcomer on the
scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this award historically does not go to
people where it's, say, like their first
[SPEAKER_01]: year breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: In past years, we've had winners such as
Bloom, Soulfire, AK Beanbrains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the idea of this award is more
to acknowledge that people who are notable
[SPEAKER_01]: names within the industry have very much
established themselves in that next sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of level.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to say tiers, establishing
themselves as the next tier of breeder in
[SPEAKER_01]: a higher status where you know that their
offerings are generally quite high quality
[SPEAKER_01]: and they've made some waves over the past
few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, to start off, I want to give the first
shout out, I want to give the honorable
[SPEAKER_01]: mention is to none other than Tiki Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually think he's had a super
productive year doing a bunch of collabs
[SPEAKER_01]: with some cool people, including the likes
of Raw and Umami Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's had a number of successful
releases in his own, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some friends who have found some
killer stuff in his gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Tiki Man, deserving of an
honorable shout out.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I just saw him have a collab with
Super Seed Co, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did something ahead of release.
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, it looks like he's been killing
it, it looks like.
[SPEAKER_05]: We met him two years ago, I believe,
at Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talked with him for a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seemed like a real nice guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen a lot of his stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like it's coming out like fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Tiki Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Likewise, another honorable mention I want
to give to my buddy Skunk Tech,
[SPEAKER_01]: who's done some great work with both the
headband, doing some feminized hybrids,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as doing some root beer work in
the form of BX2 and the root beer freeze
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really cool work overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So honorable shout out Skunk Tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got one honorable mention,
a guy that I think is up and coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be Nasha Genetics,
N-A-S-H-A.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a really good year with this
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a runs drop early in June.
[SPEAKER_05]: Had their Oreo runs, their rocky runs,
and their runs crashers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then their gushers drop, which happened
late December.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually on the website now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Had the Miracle Gushers, Apple Gushers,
Ivory Gushers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to edit that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nasha Genetics with their gushers drop.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did the gushers drop in June.
[SPEAKER_05]: That saw the Miracle Gushers, Apple
Gushers, Ice Gushers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they just had their runs drop
recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's available on the website right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had the rocky runs, the Oreo runs,
runs crashers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really frosty stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great packaging, great guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did an interview with him.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on the website there.
[SPEAKER_05]: His name is Ran.
[SPEAKER_05]: Real cool guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He sold a lot of gear and a lot of people
weren't really happy with his stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Nasha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love to hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they've actually got a hardcore OG
hybrid or some work they've done with
[SPEAKER_01]: hardcore OG in the past, which has piqued
my curiosity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I was going to mention it,
but I was like, ah, no one's going to know
[SPEAKER_05]: the hardcore.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like hardcore gushers or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hardcore gushers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an OG that I've sort of popped up
more recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been keeping my eye on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this brings us to the hottest newcomer
on the scene award.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, it's going to go to someone who
is in fact fairly new on the block and
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who I think has been making waves
and they themselves may be a bit surprised
[SPEAKER_01]: to hear this because I've never spoken to
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to actually give it to
Blockhead Buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have been paying attention,
you will likely have seen Blockhead Buds
[SPEAKER_01]: making waves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I first heard about him about 12
months ago when I saw a number of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cups being won in either first or second
place, often multiple samples in the top
[SPEAKER_01]: five for a strain called Super Booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, what's this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you sort of start following it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually it got renamed to
Blockberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Blockhead Buds is the creator of this
cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a strain that's comprised of Black
Cherry Punch by Tropicana Cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's obviously boasting like a super
turpy high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the difference and the reason why this
is so popular is that it's also potent
[SPEAKER_01]: with a unique twist on the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very mercy and dominant, but it
translates to like, you know, that typical
[SPEAKER_01]: strong citrus nose, but it's also got like
an earthy cherry-ness to it, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one grabs your attention with both
the nose, but it also keeps you focused
[SPEAKER_01]: and interested in the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much so that it's been winning cups
left and right.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned, it's often taking out
multiple spots in the top five,
[SPEAKER_01]: such as the New York Growers Cup,
where it took both first and third by two
[SPEAKER_01]: different growers respectively entering
their Blockberry samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also been a number of other cups
won.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the most interesting twist in
this saga is that Mr. Blockhead himself
[SPEAKER_01]: thought he had given away slash lost the
last of the F1 stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he wasn't going to be able to produce
any F2s or breed with males.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just had his breeder cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, recently he put a post up saying
he got sent some seed back from a friend
[SPEAKER_01]: he had sent some of the F1s to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's now some more projects on
the horizon, including maybe an F2 line.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's done some cool other breeding
projects, utilizing males such as a
[SPEAKER_01]: Triangle Kush BX1, Lemon Rose,
and Blueberry Frosting, just to name a
[SPEAKER_01]: few.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a big shout out to Blockberry Buds,
particularly for his Blockberry Cross,
[SPEAKER_01]: otherwise known as Super Booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hugely popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect you're going to see it more over
the coming 12 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Bean, what's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen the Blockberry Buds but I
have seen the Super Booth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was like, oh, that's the guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's got all those names.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just kind of like, oh, what's the
Super Booth?
[SPEAKER_05]: What the what?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the cross sounds great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I would love to dab some right now,
if you wouldn't mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, sounds like some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've taken note of it, sir, and I shall be
in contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I like I like all those points.
[SPEAKER_01]: All righty, gang.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're back for another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this episode, we are extremely
grateful to have none other than Blockhead
[SPEAKER_01]: Buds joining us today to accept his award.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to start off, a big congrats Blockhead
for taking out the hottest new breeder on
[SPEAKER_01]: the Block Award.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for thanks for giving me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even know that I was up for the
running.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to I have to give you some kudos
because in past years, the hottest
[SPEAKER_01]: newcomer on the Block Award, it actually
never really went to anyone who was sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of like in their first year or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was sort of people who'd been making
little waves but had managed to really
[SPEAKER_01]: establish themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think you're the first person in the
three or four years we've been doing this,
[SPEAKER_01]: where it seems like you truly have just
like busted down the door of the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: and charged in.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that feel?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that sounds that sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually I've kind of been doing
certain things for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little bit older.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah, so I think it's just kind of
all come to fruition at once.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it feels great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't even know, like, how does this
how does it work with you guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, how do you guys come up with,
you know, the new breeder or whatever?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, because you guys are out in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's only maybe a couple of people
that have had my seeds out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is it for like continental US is just
out in Australia?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like, how do you guys come up with the
with the winners or whatever?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are, largely speaking, an international
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you put me in the hot seat here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Largely speaking, the awards are
determined by both myself and I have James
[SPEAKER_01]: Bean of Seeds here now, one of our
grateful sponsors.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also helps guide the selection a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think together, we were both so
blown away by how well Superbooth aka
[SPEAKER_01]: Blockberry has done over the past year
that it was sort of undeniable that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, amongst all the people who were
not already really well known breeders,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you you certainly have elevated
yourself to that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a quick caveat, one of my one of my
buddies on Instagram, Oz Grown,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's been he's got this beautiful cut of
the Blockberry F1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to acknowledge he was part of
what put me onto that, because I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: this looks interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it just all exploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you found that sort of organic growth
has been the reception you've got?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the thing that guy I'm pretty
positive I know you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was like one of maybe two people out
in Australia to get the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So initially, that whole project wasn't
supposed to be a project.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just something for me personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So going back to what you and I were
talking about a little earlier is that
[SPEAKER_03]: when I first started, I bought some seed
packs, I just wanted to kind of dip my toe
[SPEAKER_03]: in to see if I liked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've grown a little bit as a kid,
we just throw bag seeds out in the yard,
[SPEAKER_03]: but all my plants would always get stolen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little kid, I talked about it,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So somebody do is rob your house,
steal it, steal your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I never ever got to actually harvest
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in in California, I'm in Southern
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in California, it went like fully
legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, all right, well,
now nobody should be stealing my plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So bought some seed packs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, man, this is crazy to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were 150 bucks for a seed pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, basically saying for free,
like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody wanted seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, well, I'm gonna I'm gonna
I'm gonna buy these about two packs about
[SPEAKER_03]: a was like papaya og from ony seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I bought triangle kush from seed
junkie.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I bought those and then planted them
with my whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, piece by piece got
bigger and bigger, started growing more
[SPEAKER_03]: and more and then went indoors because
outdoors was just a, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: bug fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just it was just a lot of work
wasn't given, you know, grew kind of boof,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't have a market for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So but based on the fact that those seeds
were so expensive to me, I was like $15
[SPEAKER_03]: for one seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe on my second or third pack about
Tropicana cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I bought the black cherry punch
from in house Tropicana cookies,
[SPEAKER_03]: another ony and hairy palms creation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I bought those found a mail of the
triangle or excuse me of the of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Tropicana cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I'm just gonna make my own
seeds that so that's how that whole
[SPEAKER_03]: project happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, this is so expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're frickin $15 per seed, I'm gonna
make 1000s of them for free.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically just, you know, found this
banger mail through it on this like,
[SPEAKER_03]: to me, it was like the terpiest black
cherry punch that I had, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I had them do their thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just got, you know, however many
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's how that project happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't supposed to be anything other
than just like a personal fun project.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just like, cool, I'm just gonna
bank these and I probably was never gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: pop them.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest with you, I was just I just
had them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that started my whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started like, I would collect all
kinds of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of like a, I wouldn't say
Pokemon, but like a record collector for
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds, you know, I was a true seed junkie.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started buying all these seeds and
all that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that guy mobile Jay, and I were
friends on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would trade seeds, essentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so one of those trades, I gave him
like five of my little project didn't have
[SPEAKER_03]: a name or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he actually popped them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it wasn't for him, I would have
never popped them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he popped them, threw them in the back
of like his warehouse or his basement,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he's like, bro, you got it,
you got to check this out, dude,
[SPEAKER_03]: these things are these things are crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he just he forgot about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he started sending me videos,
like, holy shit, and looked like a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: better than a lot of the stuff that we had
been going through and growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, God damn, so I got to pop my
seeds, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he kind of started the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like, he would I kind of liken it
to like a Doja and me being like do farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was like the hype man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the guy that started selling all
the clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: He named it super boof.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never named it that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just a little side topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he called it super boof.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like a joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like razzling me a bit, you know,
and then he started cutting them out,
[SPEAKER_03]: sending them to everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he started the whole thing in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was just like, you guys got to get that
he was selling clones and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of how it spread.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from there, I popped my own seeds
in my own little hunt, got my breeder cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's kind of how the whole
thing started.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the seeds coming to you guys,
like I like I said, I didn't have I only
[SPEAKER_03]: had like one plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't like a, you know,
it wasn't supposed to be a project per se.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then like, people started seeing all
this stuff on Instagram and mobile J
[SPEAKER_03]: started getting a bigger and bigger
following.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like all kinds of people started
hitting me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're just gonna sit in my
fridge anyways, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, might as well get these out
to the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time I go through these.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be 100 years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there was no way I was ever gonna
have time to pop all of them plus all the
[SPEAKER_03]: stacks of seed that I collected.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how I started.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I remember the guy in Australia
was like two guys, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, he actually popped them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he has he has his own phenos,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So his aren't super booth and his aren't
my breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep telling people Mike, there's so
many bangers in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jay, he found his super booth cut off
of five seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also did five seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got my breeder cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I got like two or three males
one was and then then mine was by by
[SPEAKER_03]: default.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a female that hermed and then that
was it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other one was the breeder
cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then his he he had mobile Jay had like
three females, two males.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said all three were bangers,
but he only kept the one because he didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: have room or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: What an organic story.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys have your you guys actually
have your own stuff out there that's
[SPEAKER_03]: different from mine and from the super
booth cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys have your own stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm excited to try it, too,
if I ever get up to Australia,
[SPEAKER_03]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and goes that saying,
huge shout out, I was growing the homie
[SPEAKER_01]: down under who's growing those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that story so much about that,
which is so organic and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it speaks to the fact that,
you know, some of the best strains are not
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly all fully planned out on paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, sometimes they're just
these sort of little happy accidents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to quickly ask you what
stimulated you to change the name from
[SPEAKER_01]: super booth to Blockberry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Never changed the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually called it Blockberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he didn't like that name.
[SPEAKER_03]: He being Mobile J.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he and since he was like the the the
what's his name?
[SPEAKER_01]: The DJ Khaled.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, yeah, so he's like the DJ guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, him being the hype man,
him being you know, he already had like
[SPEAKER_03]: way more followers than I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like, that was the what he was
doing just for his career.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the one that named it super booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never named it that it was never
supposed to be that initially it was a
[SPEAKER_03]: joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the name stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's kind of in the lexicon now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at this point, I don't have any ego
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you can call it whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I just want to make sure
that people know that that actually wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: He named it that as like a Raz.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then but yeah, so Blockberry was the
initial name.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said he's like, that name sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because like we were like, he was like a
little brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's kind of like a little, a little
bratty brother, like when we first
[SPEAKER_03]: started, like, yeah, hanging out kicking
it, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so he named it that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never named it that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would love to ask you, I saw
recently you put a post up talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: having gotten some of the F1s back and
maybe doing some future line work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me a bit about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you sort of accidentally lose them and
then get them back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how did that all work?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I sold, you know, basically the bulk of
them off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because like I said, they were just
sitting in my fridge and I was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I already have my winner.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I don't really need to do
anything besides this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know, so from the Black Cherry
Punch, there was, it had blueberry bread
[SPEAKER_03]: turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like blueberry muffins.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of the Blockberry, I guess,
spinos from what I have, they have tangy
[SPEAKER_03]: turps, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but I know that they're the blueberry
outliers because Jay had one.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, dude, he's like, I had one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I should have never tossed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm looking for the blueberry turps,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyhow, so I gave and sold out pretty
much all my seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I kept like 30 or 40 for myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then those 40 that I got back or those
ones that I got back were from a homie in
[SPEAKER_03]: the Bay Area that I sent to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because like I said, at first,
it was just, it was just a passion
[SPEAKER_03]: project.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was just giving them out to homies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, here, dude, pop them, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I sent him like 40 seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he hit me up and he was like,
hey, man, I still have those seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, if you want to do a hunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then he sent him back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how that happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: So currently, just so you know,
I'm doing a FEM release right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're, they're baking right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to do some S ones of the
Blockberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and then a bunch of other FEM crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because everybody's asking for FEMs,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the F2, I got a couple FEM
projects on the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after that, I'm going to be
looking for some F2s.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'll be probably next year,
by the time we find something,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, certainly seems like there's a
lot of demand for FEMs at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you, you gave me a perfect segue
because I wanted to ask you, I noticed you
[SPEAKER_01]: did work with some other males.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them that caught my eye was the
blueberry frosting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us a little bit about that
one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's from a guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's, his handle on IG is party time
farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we've been kind of homies through
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what happened, but somehow we
started chatting and I was talking to him
[SPEAKER_03]: about getting blueberry turps,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Blueberry are great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he was like, Oh, I got this mail
that he was basically just telling me
[SPEAKER_03]: about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, he's like, I'll send you
some, I'll send you some pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, no way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he ended up sending me some flour,
some pollen, and like a shit ton of his
[SPEAKER_03]: new blueberry frosting crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, dude, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he's such, he's such a badass.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just sent it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people talk a good game.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this industry, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But they never do shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this guy actually did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and then, you know, anyhow,
so that's where I got the pollen from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the blueberry frosting, I believe is
like wedding crasher crossed with
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry cookies, form cut or something
like that, but that's his creation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just did it as like a collab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, here, I'll just give you
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was kind of real.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really loose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, crazy part is he just took off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's in like Columbia now.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not even, I've been hitting him up
like, Hey dude, where can I send you these
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ghost.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, that's, that's how that,
uh, that project kind of started.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, turns out I crossed the Halle
Berry, which is ice cream cake cross with
[SPEAKER_03]: blockberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I crossed that with the blueberry frosting
and it does have blueberry turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm like super excited about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I still have some, uh, some of that
pollen I'm going to do and use on some
[SPEAKER_03]: other strains, but, uh, yeah, I'm excited
for that one for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've, you've got me wondering,
as time has gone by, I've realized more
[SPEAKER_01]: and more that largely speaking,
you can divide people into sort of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, this is very simplistic,
but two camps of flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are either more into the gassy
stuff or more into the fruity stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like you're like myself and you're
more into the fruity stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that how you would put it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it not quite that clear cut?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, I did a full gas line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it hasn't taken off because people
haven't popped the seeds and I'm like at,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, I keep doing more and more seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I haven't got to hunt them myself,
myself, but, uh, I did this whole triangle
[SPEAKER_03]: Kush cross line and it was from the actual
triangle Kush from my very first seat back
[SPEAKER_03]: from sea junkie is a T, uh, triangle Kush
BX one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I do have some super gnarly gas
right now, uh, that I did hunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got, um, I don't know if you've
heard of the soap.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I crossed the soap to triangle Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like super gnarly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also have a, uh, it's gorilla butter F2
AKA white truffle cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I crossed it with a blockberry and then I
only got a couple of seeds out of it,
[SPEAKER_03]: popped that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I crossed that to triangle Kush
and then I only got a couple of seeds out
[SPEAKER_03]: of that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just heavy, heavy gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, no, I don't just like fruity.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just kind of is something that kind of
started off that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I still have a lot of,
uh, gas shit that I'm working on right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so it's not, yeah, it's, it's
basically what I'm going to try and do is
[SPEAKER_03]: honestly, now at this stage, I have it all
mapped out in my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I need to make strains that everybody
can grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to make it to where they're
hard or finicky, or you have to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: do A, B and C to get it to yield or look
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the strains out there,
especially the hype strains, either they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't yield or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always something, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't check all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm working with a local facility here
in San Diego and, um, they're,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, professional facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're, they're on the legal side and
they actually hit, almost for a light with
[SPEAKER_03]: my, with my breeder cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: The, the, the main guy there is like,
dude, I've been growing for 20 plus years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never had anything like this in my
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I can get something to get three ish
per light, three pounds per light with
[SPEAKER_03]: every type of turf profile, like that's
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I look for certain things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make it so like, and if you talk
to anybody, blockberry slash super roof,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, it's like the easiest plant
they've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: It yields super heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got great vigor, structure,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: The flower is great, tastes great,
smells great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically what I'm trying to do at this
stage is make, I already got the orange
[SPEAKER_03]: turps, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's already or tangerine,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got the tangy turps down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I got the grapes or the, or excuse me,
the blueberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try and do some grapes,
uh, maybe papaya, and that'll be pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: much it for the fruits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm just going to do a bunch of
different gas ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if everything works out the way I hope
it will, then you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it's going to be like production
strains left and right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's going to be stoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, that's the plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see if it happens because breeding,
you never really know what you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: get.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that that's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've sort of got me thinking,
you know, it sounds as though you're
[SPEAKER_01]: helping step us out of the metaphorical
corner that some people believe we're in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of like, you know, the hype
strains are just getting smaller yielding
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're not great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wanted to know, do you think
that, um, the sort of strains you're
[SPEAKER_01]: making that are, you know, yielding better
and easier to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think they're going to become more
popular or do you think that's just
[SPEAKER_01]: something only you will probably be able
to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, here's the, here's the thing that I've
been seeing too, exactly what you just
[SPEAKER_03]: said.
[SPEAKER_03]: All I see a lot of people doing that are
current breeders are they just cross hype
[SPEAKER_03]: strain, hype strain, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all these pictures that I'll see
there to see tiny little frosty buds,
[SPEAKER_03]: like satellite sites, gangly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just like, I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for me, I want to grow best strains
of what I want to do personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I do is like, I'll look for
the beast, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That like has a big old frame structure,
et cetera, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to check pretty much every single
box.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I want to pair it with something
that has maybe a little bit of different
[SPEAKER_03]: turf or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll look for something that has a
weakness and oh, this one has that
[SPEAKER_03]: weakness in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I'll breed those two.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of the way I look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So blueberry frosting, I don't think
anybody's ever heard of this because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: not a hype strain, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Halle Berry, I created, um, there's,
I'm not breeding hype strain to hype
[SPEAKER_03]: strain, although I'm going to have to,
uh, at some point, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sell some seeds if I want, cause that's
what people want, but I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: basically have to use a bunch of shit that
nobody's ever heard of or that nobody
[SPEAKER_03]: gives a fuck about because I know that
it's going to contribute.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to answer your question, yeah,
eventually, um, in terms of on the list,
[SPEAKER_03]: the legal side here, everybody needs yield
prices of tax here in California and
[SPEAKER_03]: America in general are going down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the days of these one to two pound a
light, super frosty little buds are going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people can't get by anyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they need to maximize their space.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I want to make it so it's like
they can grow it because here's the other
[SPEAKER_03]: key thing as a breeder, people will look
at your shit and they'll, they'll,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe they suck as a grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like if I can make it shine and I beat
it up cause I go through all this testing
[SPEAKER_03]: and whatnot, make it, you know,
try and fuck it up as hard as I can to
[SPEAKER_03]: make sure it's stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if I can make it shine and I want
everybody to make it shine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so certain people will start talking
shit on the breeder, even though they may
[SPEAKER_03]: or may not know what the fuck they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so I want to make it to where it's
virtually impossible for them to fuck it
[SPEAKER_03]: up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, cause they're always like,
Oh, it hermed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe, maybe it's cause you made it
herm, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or did this or did do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like maybe it's cause of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's cause of me, maybe,
you know, but I want to make sure before
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's going to be like as easy to grow
as possible so that everybody can have
[SPEAKER_03]: success from the small hobbyist tent
grower to the, you know, facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in the production strain world,
they're going to need these heavy yielding
[SPEAKER_03]: strains that check all the boxes to stay
afloat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brilliant stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That there's a specific conscious focus on
trying to make it easier for the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every point you said is, uh,
a totally relevant, but it's interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: because as you said, you know,
other breeders may recognize some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: issues, but maybe not necessarily actively
trying to combat them through their
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, don't see, I honestly don't see
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I just saw a clone drop today from,
um, compound genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like their, their picture that they're
showing, it just looks like a little baby
[SPEAKER_03]: bud looks like a side branch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, damn, that's like the best
picture that they have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're putting that as like,
you know, here's our cone drop,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, damn, like to me just already,
I just wouldn't get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I don't, cause I know it's not
going to yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, and everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, but yeah, you're right,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think anybody, I don't know what's
in everybody's head, but from what I see
[SPEAKER_03]: from the end products, it's literally just
hype strain to hype strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of it is not even like,
I don't know what they're thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people are just throwing
shit against the wall to see if it sticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they have plans or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I don't, I try to just stay in
my own lane.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to do, you know, what I'm
doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but yeah, a lot of hype to hype.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I'm trying to stay away
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're going to have to
definitely get you on for a sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: extended show on, on your, your work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to chat more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that pretty much sums up the
questions I had for you in regards to this
[SPEAKER_01]: award in terms of the final thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to know, what do you think is
going to be the next big flavor that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to dominate the industry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's a, yeah, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically from where it stands now,
at least here, everybody likes gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, and nobody likes, or everybody
has their own flavors of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's, let's just say that everybody likes
their own flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what everybody I think wants currently
right now is a, is a gassy candy strain
[SPEAKER_03]: that also heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but those don't really exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually there's going to be like the gassy
strains are usually like lower yielding
[SPEAKER_03]: from, from my experience, harder to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they don't look that great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they basically want the best of both
worlds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So somebody wants, I think the newest
thing will be whoever comes up with like
[SPEAKER_03]: this candy, gassy, super heavy yielding
covered in trichomes that also has power,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the other key thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a lot of these strains, they tend to
say, oh, they're not, they're not that
[SPEAKER_03]: powerful or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll check like three boxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So in terms of the turf profile,
I would say a candy gas, like a still
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit, but like heavy gas, if that's even,
I don't even know if it's possible though,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like I've had some stuff or it
kind of almost checks those boxes,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it doesn't, it doesn't check them all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's going to be the next
wave, but I don't know, man, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: like asking like, you know, does everybody
like IPAs, you know, some people like
[SPEAKER_03]: crisp beers, lagers, some people like
IPAs, some people like stouts,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, or ice cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see though.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what takes off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, a huge congratulations on
winning the hottest newcomer on the block
[SPEAKER_01]: award to blockhead of blockhead genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did I win?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll send you a, I'll, I'll paint
something up in Microsoft paint for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we wrap up, did you have any
general comments or shout outs you wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to make?
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, shout out to mobile Jay,
uh, for basically popping the seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start off there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I, without him and he, and I've had
these conversations multiple times without
[SPEAKER_03]: him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably would have never popped them
without him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably would have never even started
anything that I've started.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, big ups to Jay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, shout out to, uh, man, shout out to,
uh, Harry palms, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause without him, there'd have been no
Tropicana cookie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to in-house.
[SPEAKER_03]: There would have been no black cherry
punch for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's just, let's start there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a ton of shout outs,
but, uh, yeah, I'll just, I'll just kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of leave it in the, in the, uh,
in that for the blockberry, you know what
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to those group, uh,
for starting what they started and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, for letting me fuck with
it, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And creating blockberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like a very well-earned shout
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much blockhead for joining
us today and congrats again on the award.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congrats hottest newcomer on the scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out blockhead buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So onto our next award.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the hottest seed drop of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to start off, let's give some honorable
mentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give, as mentioned earlier,
an honorable mention to crickets and
[SPEAKER_01]: cicada for their puck back cross to work,
which has garnered a lot of success
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing males such as the puck to create
the BX or the DC three also using a skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as an alternative shoreline skunk
clone, two different sensei star cuttings,
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubba Kush and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've done really well on the back of
last year's breeder of the year award and
[SPEAKER_01]: building a continuation of the puck line
work they've been doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So huge shout out, honorable mention to
crickets and cicada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Likewise, I want to give an honorable
mention to exotic Mike, his power Sherb
[SPEAKER_01]: work, definitely causing some waves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being popular, I know Mr. Bean's a big fan
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike breeds with many of his own
creations, which I give him credit for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many breeders line up comprises mostly
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were likely gifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, Mike does phenohunt his own work
and breed forward with it, which is a cool
[SPEAKER_01]: feature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Bean got any honorable mentions for
the hottest seed drop of the year?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for me, I'd definitely shout out to
Mike on those.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cool to have been with him from the
start, so to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were distributing for him since 2013
and not from the start.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to start breeding like 2009,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've been with him for a long time
anyhow, and it's cool just to see his work
[SPEAKER_05]: evolve and now start to see it in a lot of
other people's work.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not surprised.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, wow, he's using Mike's cut of
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you're not surprised, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd be surprised if they didn't have one
of Mike's cuts in their lineup,
[SPEAKER_05]: so to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is kind of cool to mention that
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then for me this year, Mike had a lot of
good drops with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had those two drops that went really,
really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: The red pop drop and the red wrench drop.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for me this year, it definitely is
going to be the crickets and cicadas.
[SPEAKER_05]: The buck PC3 drop.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't keep that thing in stock.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was calling old Bob every other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was sending him emails.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it was sold out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You crashed my site.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I get some more of those?
[SPEAKER_05]: Check your mailbox.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I get some more of those?
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I felt a bit like two gums.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tommy at one point, hey man, you got any
more of that BX3?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were happy to have that in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it helped.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, I met him last year and he
gave me a big jar of that shit and it just
[SPEAKER_05]: kept knocking me in.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kept knocking my dick in the dirt every
time I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't figure out what the hell was
wrong with me for like a month.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh, it's probably this weed
that's on my desk now that I've been
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just couldn't function.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just serious.
[SPEAKER_05]: Serious weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one of the ones that I most
looked forward to and I put a bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: packs aside.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one, and then of course shut out the
thug bug.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's back.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's over his surgery now.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's feeling a lot better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still honoring his health, but feeling a
lot better.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had his peanut butter BX drop.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are actually doing a presale of that
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was re-dropped because he ran out of
the first one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he did another one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been two months and three months in
the making.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll have that.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has that RS11.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rainbow Sherb, not Roadkill Skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those were two really good drops.
[SPEAKER_05]: But where are you going with this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was going to say shout out Groma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to hear you're doing well after the
surgery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that overall for this year,
the winner for me was pretty obvious and
[SPEAKER_01]: it feels like almost sandbagging a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the hottest seardrop of this year,
I think is undeniably Chris Compound's
[SPEAKER_01]: Apples and Bananas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its success was simply unparalleled.
[SPEAKER_01]: The compound drop garnered a huge amount
of support and attention, even featuring
[SPEAKER_01]: NFT drops to accompany them and some top
shelf pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drop sold out extremely quickly and
from what we both saw at the Emerald Cup,
[SPEAKER_01]: had people lining up around the corner for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: High Times has in fact recently named Pink
Certs its Strain of the Year for 2022,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was included in this Apples and
Bananas drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other notable strains from the drop
included Gastropops, which has garnered a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of popularity utilizing the White
Runts mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the overall success is a testament not
only to the power of good marketing,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has undeniably played a role in the
success, but also to how when good
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing combined with quality genetics
will make for something truly special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having tried the Apples and Bananas
myself, I can say it's some beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grapey, berry, sort of hard to describe at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It dominates a bag and these hybrids are
offering growers many of the best
[SPEAKER_01]: qualities of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts Mr. Bean,
Apples and Bananas?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, it goes back to what I've
always preached and said.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the best guys, the guys that can
run the numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a numbers game folks, it really is.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can all go by the same clone and we're
all going to have the same kind of the
[SPEAKER_05]: same clone of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or we can run from seeds and we're
guaranteed something uniquely ours,
[SPEAKER_05]: something that nobody else has.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like baseball cards, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You could have the first five pack,
you could get that Babe Ruth, but Hank
[SPEAKER_05]: Aaron is always out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you could collect cards for 10 years
and pop 10,000 beads and never get it,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always out there floating around.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always that better one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these breeders at these giant
facilities, you know, they have the
[SPEAKER_05]: opportunity to run 5,000 at a time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when you're using that kind of
numbers for phenol hunts, you're able to
[SPEAKER_05]: find that something that's something
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always heard breeders say that,
you know, if you look for it, it's in
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't keep doing the line.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's in there, just keep looking.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you want to find is there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think that, you know,
they have the ability to run these giant
[SPEAKER_05]: populations and see these plants and see
the subtle differences in them to see that
[SPEAKER_05]: one that really sticks out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think that's truly special.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think all the guys that have that
ability definitely shine.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge shout out and congratulations to the
apples and bananas drop by Chris of
[SPEAKER_01]: Compound Genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Chris Lynch.
[SPEAKER_05]: So because now compound, the other,
there's two Chris's.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Chris Lynch and there's the other
Chris, which is also one of their
[SPEAKER_05]: scientists guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so now they're like, they just did a
thing on Future Canvas Project.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were like, they said Chris with
compound.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris with compound?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he's along with fucking compound.
[SPEAKER_05]: And look at the TV and it's, they keep
saying Chris with a compound, but it's not
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris compound.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the other Chris.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Chris from Node.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris from Node Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So up next, we've got the Hall of Fame.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your predictions?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got anything coming to mind for you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when you talk about what you want it
to be, but I was thinking about that,
[SPEAKER_05]: like what would be my Hall of Fame strain,
but that's just giving it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would just, I don't know what I would
do like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be, you know, like ruining a
future strain for us to talk about,
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I like that angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Hall of Fame strain for this year
is, Haze by the Haze Brothers in all of
[SPEAKER_01]: its incarnations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have certainly seen a recent resurgence
of popularity for Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this initially got some momentum
probably around the time Neville passed
[SPEAKER_01]: and the NL5 came back into the limelight.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more recently with the advent of
things like the Colombian Black Haze or
[SPEAKER_01]: the PIF, as well as work by people like
Tom Hill and Mr. Bob's reproduction,
[SPEAKER_01]: we are seeing Haze yet again more the
focus of attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the cannabis community Zeitgeist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a strain that I think is well
worthy of the Hall of Fame.
[SPEAKER_01]: Work done by Sam and then the work of
countless others around the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: the likes of Oldtimer One and many other
unsung heroes, Haze is a truly special
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I can do it justice in
just a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope I can cover some of the main
points, but Haze gave birth to a wave of
[SPEAKER_01]: smokers who pursued the euphoric and
cerebral effects that Haze has become
[SPEAKER_01]: iconic for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is certainly a white whale in its own
right, claimed by countless OGs to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: pinnacle of smoking and combining some of
the oldest building blocks the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: genome has to offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haze truly is unlike any other strain,
having countless incarnations varying from
[SPEAKER_01]: mixes of pure Colombians through to Thai
hybrids through to NL5 Haze hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made its mark on history without any
doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: A recent resurgence has been brought on by
several people in the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Notable OGs, the likes of Tom Hill have
launched into massive Haze-Feno hunts to
[SPEAKER_01]: show everyone just how kick-ass the Keeper
Feno is that many have spoken so fondly
[SPEAKER_01]: about, as well as others, the likes of Mr.
Bob, who has carried on the preservation
[SPEAKER_01]: work by continuing the Tom Hill's Haze and
releasing it commercially, as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: making a Haze hybrid featuring Oldtimer
One's Haze, Tom Hill's Haze and original
[SPEAKER_01]: Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Descending originally from the Haze
brothers to Sam and then to the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: Haze is truly something unique,
something in its own category and
[SPEAKER_01]: something clearly worthy of the Hall of
Fame category.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe more simply put, Haze rules
everything around me.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts, Mr. Bean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought, you know, I thought we were
going a different direction with that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you were going with the blue
dream, which is, you know, a Haze
[SPEAKER_05]: derivative, you could say.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Haze is a classic, wonderful
choice.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Haze brothers got that thing 12 to 16
week strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people don't grow it out or won't
grow it out because they don't have the
[SPEAKER_05]: time for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super, super huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: It stretches like no other.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's very, definitely like that strong,
super cat pissy smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's definitely something that's been
worked by many people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know that many people nowadays
have smoked the Haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the new smokers I don't believe
have because I don't believe that shops
[SPEAKER_05]: pay for the Haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: And today's growing economy of,
you know, that plant has to pay for its
[SPEAKER_05]: way.
[SPEAKER_05]: A 16 week strain or 12 week strain doesn't
really pay its bills to be there next to
[SPEAKER_05]: an eight week strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to pay the same price.
[SPEAKER_05]: Price per pound, price per gram.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but the Haze's are phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, it's just, I just,
I don't know many people that can grow
[SPEAKER_05]: them or that have them because they do
take so it's such a long time,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's worth the wait for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those who are patient are rewarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to try to get into some of it
myself in the near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, a big congrats to the strain
Haze and all those associated with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people, so many unsung heroes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not doing it justice, but everyone
who's played a role, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, I mean, cause those guys weren't,
they weren't pheno hunting in the sixties,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause that's where, I mean, we can talk
the Haze goes all the way back to the
[SPEAKER_05]: sixties.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anything that's led, that's held the
test of time for like 50 years,
[SPEAKER_05]: people still have it or still talk about
it, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's gotta be something special there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause these guys weren't doing pheno hunts
back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were just, you know, or they're
smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just, so it's for something to work
and spread that far and wide.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's gotta be all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stand the test of time for good reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our next award, we're going to do the
Hall of Fame Breeder next.
[SPEAKER_01]: So following the same principle as last
time, I guess I won't get you to spurt out
[SPEAKER_01]: what could be next year's suggestion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll get right into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for this year, the Hall of Fame Breeder
we want to induct is none other than Bodhi
[SPEAKER_01]: of Bodhi Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I really need to say any more?
[SPEAKER_01]: Truly a name that needs no introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bodhi is a pillar in our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most iconic yet simplistic seed
packaging the community has ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you see that green bag and that
gold label, you know straight away what it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bodhi's worked with countless cannabis
lines, countless proven males that have
[SPEAKER_01]: yielded amazing clones that the community
has benefited from.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Snow Lotus has given birth to famous
lines such as the Goji Oji, the Ancient
[SPEAKER_01]: Oji, Tranquil Elephantiser, so many more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his beloved 88 G13 Hash Plant male has
given birth to some undeniable legends,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Black Triangle, as well as the
infamous entire Deep Line Alchemy Range,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is paired to other Old World
Indicas.
[SPEAKER_01]: His preservation work with Norica Seeds is
up there with some of those who dedicate
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves exclusively to that sort of
preservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has countless lines from Afghanis to
Africans, Colombians to Nepalese and Thai.
[SPEAKER_01]: This work is utilized by many other
breeders, both for selection and for their
[SPEAKER_01]: own reproductions, ensuring future
generations can continue the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Furthermore, his creation stemming from
Supernatural Selections, where he makes
[SPEAKER_01]: raw F1 hybrids with land, race and
heirloom varieties, remixing like a DJ,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to give the people a new unheard
sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's involved in countless charity
projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: He supports the community through still
using testers, which most breeders have
[SPEAKER_01]: faced.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's also more recently taken an active
role in trying to facilitate the broader
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis community to experience a new and
enlightening cannabis effect with his
[SPEAKER_01]: assignment as the head of genetics at
Cookies, something I'm extremely excited
[SPEAKER_01]: to see happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Truly one of the most standout humans I've
ever had the privilege of calling one of
[SPEAKER_01]: my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 2022 Hall of Fame Breeder goes to none
other than Bodhi of Bodhi Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for everything you do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bodhi is an icon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another one to knock it out of the park as
far as Hall of Famer for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's an icon in the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had the pleasure of meeting him a few
times.
[SPEAKER_05]: He does have the simplest packaging out
there, but that goes to show you it's not
[SPEAKER_05]: about the packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about what's inside the packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know of any of my breeders,
like 70 of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think everybody has a packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bodhi Seeds in their collection.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they don't, they should.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't buy them from me,
buy them from one of his guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bodhi is an amazing breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: He says he's not a breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: He says he helps plants have sex,
but he's got for sure lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got a seed collection that people
would die for for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't definitely surprised when Cookies
wanted to get the best out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got the best collection, best
library.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely, if you've seen the baggie,
you've seen it once, you've seen it twice.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, crack baggie with a gold label.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you said, simply iconic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge, huge, huge thank you to Bodhi for
everything you do, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're so appreciative as a community and
it is with great sadness.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bid farewell to our friend,
Jaime Chiba, aka James Schenk,
[SPEAKER_01]: aka the Alaskan Santa Claus, one of the
kindest people you would ever meet and a
[SPEAKER_01]: man who dedicated himself to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The head honcho of the Alaskan cannabis
seed cache.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sadly, we lost Jaime just before our last
episode and we are truly devastated to see
[SPEAKER_01]: him pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's associated with countless strains,
such as the roadkill skunk, the mud blight
[SPEAKER_01]: delight and the Alaskan thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: He specialized in older strains,
often from the 80s and 90s and focused his
[SPEAKER_01]: work on preserving genetics for future
generations to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Truly a gentleman of the highest quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm deeply sad to have lost a valuable
member of our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jaime Chiba, thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ride on into infinity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and then I have an RIP as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: This year also, we lost Matthew DeSale of
goat monkey seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Goat monkey did like a chocolate dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did the triangle Kush S1 sire runs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Matthew, I first met Matthew about six
years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: He, you know, actually one of my ads to
work a booth in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come out and work the booth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, later I was, it was
cornbread Ricky's suggestion that he,
[SPEAKER_05]: he worked the booth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, well, that's as bad as good as
resumes anybody can have.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he worked for us a very little while as
our East coast rep and worked out in the
[SPEAKER_05]: East coast with us every time we'd hang
out with Kim dog and started breeding and
[SPEAKER_05]: real, real good guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did a lot, a lot of good work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but, uh, he passed away, uh,
on September of this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, RIP to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A huge, huge shout out to his family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: RIP Zochi, a valued member of the
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb of CSI has recently done a
reproduction of the sterling skunk,
[SPEAKER_01]: which comes by way of, by way of,
uh, both Bodie and Zochi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully his work can live on through
that line, but that's a, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: another sad farewell.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to say.
Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: that must bring us to the big award for
the end of the year, the breeder of the
[SPEAKER_01]: year award.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few people in contention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's only right to give some
honorable mentions and one that we've done
[SPEAKER_01]: a few times already.
[SPEAKER_01]: None other than Mr. Bob Hemphill and
Hannibal of crickets and cicada.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've had yet another super successful
year coming off the back of last year's
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder of the year win.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've continued to blaze a trail forward
with their puck line, this time working on
[SPEAKER_01]: the back cross too, making a range of
hybrids, including the shoreline skunk,
[SPEAKER_01]: the sensei star, the bubba cushion more,
as well as doing a haze preservation
[SPEAKER_01]: project among it, the Tom Hill haze F3,
as well as a hybrid haze project,
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporating old timers haze,
Tom Hill's haze and original haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: So well, well done crickets and cicada.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, crickets and cicadas definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had, uh, you know, it was really
happy there that Tom Hill's haze drop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then of course the puck PC3,
uh, was, like I said, crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was burning up his phone, trying to get
more of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, also for, for me and honorable
mentioned, uh, one of my guys that I
[SPEAKER_05]: liked, you know, that exotic, you know,
he had, you know, at least three drops
[SPEAKER_05]: this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, each of them sold over a hundred
packs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, he's a good, good guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, he's good, good breeding technique is,
is gear.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was solid as hell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I've been repping this stuff for a
while now and, uh, uh, always,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, never had a problem with any Mike's
gear, really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will give a third honorable mention
to someone, not too many degrees of
[SPEAKER_01]: separation related to Mike, none other
than Soulphi.
[SPEAKER_01]: He too has had a very productive year with
a number of releases, the Bahama triangle,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, uh, hood candies and the mind flayer
series all dropping within the past 12
[SPEAKER_01]: months.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's certainly blazing a path forward,
not too dissimilar to exotic Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the breeder of the year going to
none other than Chris Lynch of compound
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our runner up breeder of the year for last
year has gone on to take the head spot
[SPEAKER_01]: this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's worked his ass off doing compound
drops, cookies, collabs, NFTs,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing deals and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's undeniable that Chris has been one of
the biggest movers in shakers in the scene
[SPEAKER_01]: over the past 12 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much so that all of it, uh,
sorry, it's undeniable that Chris has been
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the biggest movers and shakers in
the scene over the past 12 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, all this has been mirrored in
recent with the reveal that he has sold
[SPEAKER_01]: and left compound genetics to start a new
venture called Cypher genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear more from the man himself now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alrighty, my friends, we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this time grateful to be joined by the
man of the hour, one of the hottest dudes
[SPEAKER_01]: in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big congratulations to Chris on winning
several awards this past year,
[SPEAKER_01]: including most anticipated seed drop
breeder of the year and clone of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off, thank you so much for
joining us today, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so grateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine you must be a very busy man
given everything I just said.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're very grateful to have your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it feel to win these awards?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like you've had a big year the
past year?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mixture, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels good to get the recognition from
the industry and from my peers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always very humbling to receive
awards like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the recognition and the
award.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel this year has been a big year for
me with all the wins I've had and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: new obstacles I've had to overcome with
compound and with my own place in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to where 2023 takes me
and what's next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that all of your fans are equally
excited for what you have for us over the
[SPEAKER_01]: coming few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the clone of the year
award.
[SPEAKER_01]: So apples and bananas took out clone of
the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'd probably have to be living
under a rock to have not heard or
[SPEAKER_01]: experienced apples and bananas at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the place I'd love to start is
maybe going back to the genesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember that pollination where you
made it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was it about those two parents
that drew you to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think something I really like
about apples and bananas is that it
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizes genetics you don't see as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that helped made it special.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd love to hear your take on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I made it across back in 2019,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working in a small basement I had
access to in Portland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I received the nalinator cut from my
friend Clearwater Genetics in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I traded him some cuts for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a Gelato 41.
[SPEAKER_00]: I traded him for the nalinator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I received that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I immediately put it to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really expect anything special to
come from the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really awesome to see how far it's
come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was really cool to see that
recognition I received.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember giving the phenotype and
the selection to Berner when I started
[SPEAKER_00]: working with cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's the one that really put apples
and bananas on the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to give him all the credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, all the credit, but part of the
credit for basically creating the branding
[SPEAKER_00]: and helping with the recognition that this
cut's received and the momentum it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really cool to see where that
comes full circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know you had made it that long
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's cool to hear the backstory on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something which grabbed my eye about it is
that this is the second big cut that has
[SPEAKER_01]: utilized work from Sin City Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they largely speaking sort of
fly under the radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people may know that JBZ also used
some of their work in the wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we now got two nice clones that
sort of illustrate some of the quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: their genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this a thought you've ever meditated
on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe Sin City's like secretly the
breeders breeder?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think like a bit of a
coincidence?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a coincidence in some
aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But definitely note, Sin City does lots of
solid work in the blue power they created.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a big part of JBZ's genetics
in his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, they definitely have an eye and a
taste for quality and good genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a reason their work is
known as backbones for so many pre-flip
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that recent answer, you mentioned
working with Berner and how he helped
[SPEAKER_01]: promote the strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to ask, what's that like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because obviously the media powerhouse
that is Cookies is undeniable,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the ability to really market
strains better than 99.9% of people can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a bit surreal to see your work get
showcased so well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how did that come about, I guess?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's very humbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still taken aback by it every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very awesome experience to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grateful to work with Berner and the
whole Cookies team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when we first linked up about
around 2019 in San Francisco, he was
[SPEAKER_00]: asking for some jars of flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Apple's Benes cut, which didn't
have that name at the time, I had in a jar
[SPEAKER_00]: and I gave it to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he immediately gravitated towards
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to give him props for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a very strong eye for a taste and
for what's going to work in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think without him selecting
that Fino with me and giving it the name
[SPEAKER_00]: Apple's Benes, it would be recognized
where it is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really cool to be able to work
with someone like Berner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas that ability to basically put a
strain on or off and have him select
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that I created, and obviously
decide to put them on the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really cool experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to hear that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to ask you about something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been grateful to have received a few
samples of apples and bananas while I was
[SPEAKER_01]: in the States recently, and they were
gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something people said to me and that I
also experienced myself is it has this
[SPEAKER_01]: quality to it that is similar to some of
the citrus strains in the sense that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not citrus, but it cuts through.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have one bud of it in a bag of stuff
and it's like, that's all you smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really cuts through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering, because you look at the
genetics and I wasn't really sure where
[SPEAKER_01]: that trait was coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any speculations on why it's
got such a dominant profile to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not exactly sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was back to the work Sin City did
and that blue power or it could be the
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture of the GDP or just a combination
of all the genetics in the crust together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to get more of a gassy unique
profile from it, but everyone has their
[SPEAKER_00]: own kind of trait there or they're
tripping, they pull out from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's definitely something that makes
it unique with the cuts through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's definitely a strong one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should clarify.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say, I don't think it
smells like citrus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually can't describe the flavor
profile, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of people say that as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mixture of, yeah, gassy,
unique berries, grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something about those genetics just seemed
to really work well, which is lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So next thing I wanted to ask you is one
of the other awards you won is the hottest
[SPEAKER_01]: seed drop of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I had to do a single one,
I would say probably the apples and
[SPEAKER_01]: bananas drop, but I want to give equal
props to the grape gas drop, which I think
[SPEAKER_01]: also did really well, had some standout
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your recollection on those two
drops and is one of them more memorable to
[SPEAKER_01]: you than the other or you think they're
both sort of equal?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both special in their own way for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the grape gas created more of a
wave on its own because the grape gas
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't really have any recognition going
into that seed collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of its own strain that didn't
really have a wave from cookies prior to
[SPEAKER_00]: the release.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm grateful and surprised at the whole
momentum that Pink Surge has received in
[SPEAKER_00]: other strains from that collection,
like the mellows, Pink Surge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all very strong strains that
have done well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of that collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the apples and bananas is also
unique on its own because it kind of was a
[SPEAKER_00]: culmination of all the work with burner
and with cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was special in a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're both really good
collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they both have unique profiles
that adds something to the gene pool and
[SPEAKER_00]: will be here for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you just touched on, the Pink Surge
has done really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: High Times recently named Pink Surge as
the Strain of the Year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you anticipating that to be the one
that stood out of the grape gas drop or
[SPEAKER_01]: was there another one that you maybe
suspected might have done a little better?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually surprised by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still awesome to see that success
that Strain's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So props to the Surge guys and everyone
from the Surge family who's kind of been
[SPEAKER_00]: on board for this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made that whole branding and naming
on my own and didn't really reach out to
[SPEAKER_00]: those guys prior to doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of cool to see that whole
thing come full circle and create the way
[SPEAKER_00]: it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely a unique and strong
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an idea from the get-go that it
would be a powerhouse, but the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: momentum it's received and where it's gone
is nothing I expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very cool to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incredible, incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm going to put you in a hard spot
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could only pick one pack out of the
apples and bananas drop and one pack out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the grape gas drop, which would be your
pick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, that's a tough question, very tough
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the grape gas, I have to pick Pink
Surge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from apples and bananas, I'm thinking
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either the Goofy's, the Jover's 31 by
apples and bananas or the Exotic Squared,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Red Pop by apples and bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are both very strong ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool to hear the Red Pop hybrid in
there getting a mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would love to know, because I think
you and a few other people would have a
[SPEAKER_01]: good idea of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you predict will be some of the
big flavor profiles we see roll in over
[SPEAKER_01]: the coming year or so?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any predictions for what might come back,
so to speak?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the purple gas is here to stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to go away anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll see more of mixtures of old
lost strains or more unique profiles mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: with the current strains, like purple gas
mixed with some unique cultivar that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of been forgotten about or was hot
five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to come back as a new version
mixed with purple gas or mixed with runs
[SPEAKER_00]: or mixed with some hot strains or mixed
with z-terps, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new mixed to old, I kind of see that
as a new wave for the next wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some more skunk-terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find some more original
skunk-terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always been a desirable thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, just a mixture of new and old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it will be possibly some new stuff
we'll see coming forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just things that aren't on the radar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's so much of the same right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are looking for things that are
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything that's different that stands
out, that checks all the boxes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think will do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too true, too true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're seeing that in the industry
for sure, that some of the old is coming
[SPEAKER_01]: back, but there's definitely some new
staples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like that term purple gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to adopt that term into my
library because I never heard it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon as you said it, I knew exactly
what you meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or purple candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both purple candy, purple gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both very hot right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so final question for this little
award segment.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can we hope to see from you over the
coming year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we think we might see a seed drop at
some point or we just need to wait and see
[SPEAKER_01]: what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm working on some new projects
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see too much at the moment,
but you'll see some seed drops coming soon
[SPEAKER_00]: in the next year, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we're trying to work on some
stuff with Berner and the Crease team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some new projects I'm working with
Berner as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see some new stuff from me on my
own and some collaboration with various
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot wait to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, thank you so much for coming on
and chatting to us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were there any general comments or shout
outs you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you to the community and for
everyone recognizing my work and
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting me throughout this journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been awesome to see the amount of
feedback and love I get from the
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as shout outs, shout out to Berner,
shout out to the SIRS guys, shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: Runs, shout out to RN from Greenhouse and
the Strahan Tors crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Deep East, shout out to
Wizardry, Julio the Seaplug and everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: that supports me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all your support and love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much again, Chris, for coming
by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big thanks to Chris for giving us that
insight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, a Breeder of the Year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris Lynch for Compound Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2022 absolutely crushed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Bean, what's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was Chris your pick?
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have gone with Exotic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have gone with Exotic just because
I think he had more of those drops.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Chris also did the Joker's line,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what happened to Joker's line?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't come out through Compound yet,
has it?
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you go on my website under BreederX
and you look at the mail I was used in all
[SPEAKER_05]: those trains,
[SPEAKER_05]: that might be the hidden Joker's line
unreleased.
[SPEAKER_02]: What sort of fell off a truck vibe are you
given here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't know that the community
would really go for somebody else using
[SPEAKER_05]: that many of somebody else's work,
so to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, if you look at what was used.
[SPEAKER_05]: But all that media and all that hype just
goes to nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be a shame.
[SPEAKER_05]: So check out BreederX website.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get yourself a phenotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Gastropop, I have heard, is something
special for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the pink shirts.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great here.
[SPEAKER_05]: High times, you know, on a strain of the
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And their packaging was on point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those guys, that's how they got that
special thing is by running numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you're going to get when you
run numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to find just because you have
a pack of something doesn't mean it's the
[SPEAKER_05]: best something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or sometimes you might need two packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that just about brings us to the end
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, as always, for joining
me, Mr. Bean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate your audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love listening to all your stuff
over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to get Bogg Jr. on with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to sit down and have him talk
with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that you did an excellent,
great podcast with his dad.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it'd be really cool to get you
and him going on a follow up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got him and Duke talking as of last
Saturday together.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to do their first collab
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because as he mentioned, as Bogg mentioned
on your show, he mentioned that I had set
[SPEAKER_05]: him and Duke up to do a collab.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he unfortunately passed away
before they got it started.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this just kind of finishes that
project up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's lovely and cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to follow up with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can check out my YouTube channel,
Get Real Seeds here now, YouTube.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've got the interview with Bogg on
the DUNN show that he just, we talk about
[SPEAKER_05]: basically the gear that I have that I'm
selling, came from his dad and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then hopefully we'll get the full sit
down, the three hour in-depth interview
[SPEAKER_05]: with Dad with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it'd be cool to cover that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to everyone who's made it to the end,
we appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's us signing off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hey, by the way, anybody that will
listen to this show, if they use hot cast,
[SPEAKER_05]: free ship, gets free shipping on their
order.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a stackable coupon.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that works with any other coupon.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not usually, it's usually either or,
but this just works with all of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all your listeners, podcast,
