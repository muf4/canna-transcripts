[SPEAKER_01]: One of my absolute favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bodhi, here to get into it in the
two-parter, without further delay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello and welcome to another episode of
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: On today, we have a big one, a follow up
from what has to be one of our most fan
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite episodes from a few years ago,
an absolute titan in the breeding world,
[SPEAKER_01]: a real breeders breeder who's prolific
both in their output, as well as the wide
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of strains they work with,
from land race to hype beast.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the most kindest, most empathetic
and loving people I've ever met and
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who I'm honored to call a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big welcome to Bodhi of Bodhi Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, my friend?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: My super powered cannabis comrade,
you got me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm like blushing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't start off like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm stupefied.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're very kind and generous with all
that you said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I was going to say a man who needs
no introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I thought, nah, stuff it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does need an introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look, I guess, you know, the question
we ask everyone recently, what are you
[SPEAKER_01]: been smoking on recently?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, to be super honest, I haven't really
been smoking for the last maybe two
[SPEAKER_03]: months.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, ever since my son Bodhi passed,
I've been really trying to cultivate my
[SPEAKER_03]: clarity and really kind of rest in the
emotions and the rest in this place of
[SPEAKER_03]: really feeling it and really trying to
understand it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, grief is such an incredibly
powerful substance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I feel like it's the ultimate kind of
solvent in a way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just completely dissolves you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like I'm in a place where I can
do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But cannabis is such an emotional like
substance too, in a way it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's tied to smell, which is emotional.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much in it that I was also too
a little bit scared but I just needed a
[SPEAKER_03]: break.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like you've been swimming and
you just want to jump on the raft.
[SPEAKER_03]: So but the good news is I'm feeling good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like this weekend, I'm going to
start back on the plant medicines.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the next journey in my healing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I will probably be I think I'll
try for the first one, maybe I've been
[SPEAKER_03]: enjoying this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called a Kongoji Mana.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like Goji, Congolese, and then
Hawaiian Afghani together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has this really, I mean,
I have to do it when I don't have to get
[SPEAKER_03]: up for kids in the morning for school,
but it has this really clean like,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like some, you know how some plants
are kind of like spirit nourishing,
[SPEAKER_03]: they just kind of take you on this like
soft, buoyant ride through all the things
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're interested in and all the
things that you want to give gratitude
[SPEAKER_03]: for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just, you know, and I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was smoking it before and I really love
listening to music on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, even better is like
searching for music like I'm a treasure
[SPEAKER_03]: hunter at heart and everything I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I go one of my most favorite things to
do is get super blazed and then go like on
[SPEAKER_03]: the band camp or something someplace that
you can kind of follow the tidbits and
[SPEAKER_03]: look for new music and you know,
go from like crazy world music to
[SPEAKER_03]: electronic to, to field recordings like
they have like Maria Sabina chants to
[SPEAKER_03]: like, there's so much cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is super enjoyable and kind of
makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's coming up really soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to answer your question before that,
you know, I was smoking that and I was
[SPEAKER_03]: been working on a kind of like this Lao
pure Kush that was really, had a really
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of good experience for me as a little
bit just kind of too edgy.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing this one called blue
camphor.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like an OG KB orgasmatron.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then even before that, the best stuff
was all of the samples from the big Hayes
[SPEAKER_03]: Valley grow out, grew out with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the land races and Sativas,
and there are so many amazing samples in
[SPEAKER_03]: that, but you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really been smoking as much as I
used to, and I'm really trying to get back
[SPEAKER_03]: into it because you know, it's just been,
it's been a wild ride the last few years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know, but I feel good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel cannabis is truly one of my
best friends and teachers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sorry for the long rolling answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I just love to start off by
passing on both mine and the listener's
[SPEAKER_01]: sincere condolences for the loss of your
son.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I was, I was fortunate
enough to have met Bodhi a few times and
[SPEAKER_01]: it was immediately clear to me how loved
he was by his family and how important he
[SPEAKER_01]: was to you, his mom, his brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, again, our sincere
condolences and I'm, I'm glad to hear that
[SPEAKER_01]: you feel like you're sort of coming out
the other end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's obviously, obviously something
that we can't even imagine, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's cool to hear that you've
been getting back into music, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: while we're on the topic, one of the
little Easter eggs of the show is that if
[SPEAKER_01]: you go to, if you go to the show,
SoundCloud, and you look at the favorites,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's my little secret random SoundCloud
treasure trove for the listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should put up my band camp.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what I've been thinking recently,
I'm trying to think of what the only time
[SPEAKER_03]: I get to listen now is like when I'm in
the car, taking the kids like back from
[SPEAKER_03]: school.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it that's so, I know like one that
we've been, what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like a, is it Moroccan or Algerian
band?
[SPEAKER_03]: Less fits it woman with one guy,
like less filiers do something like,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just, it's kind of like Nawa-ish and
it has this really cool female kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: chanting drone, but with, and I think they
use a Gimberi or something, that goat skin
[SPEAKER_03]: base.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like a dork though, cause all my
friends are like, Oh, what are you
[SPEAKER_03]: listening to?
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I'm supposed to be kind of a,
I think, I think I've just been,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like the whole process of going
through all these challenges has really
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of just brought me to like a base
place of like surrender.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like my mind hasn't caught up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely hard being put on the spot,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, look in your, in your last answer,
you referenced that you've, you've been
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoying some new sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd love to hear like, how,
how do you think we can try to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: sativas back into the picture?
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the ideas I heard recently that
resonated with me was Shanti when I
[SPEAKER_01]: interviewed him, made this sort of comment
about how Neville's haze is like the
[SPEAKER_01]: champagne of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sort of thought that's actually like
quite an interesting and possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: innovative way to market some really
hardcore sativas, you know, because they
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of are like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you experienced them, what's your
thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do, how do we bring it around back to
sativas and what have you been enjoying
[SPEAKER_01]: lately?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativa wise?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the problem with sativas is the
pro is the profitability and the duration.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think if we can try and capture some
of these highs and package them into a
[SPEAKER_03]: shorter flower time or like empower farms
and growers to really find sativas that
[SPEAKER_03]: they love and they can cultivate well and,
and somehow get those out to the people
[SPEAKER_03]: and then also get sativas out to
everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like my whole thing right now is I
realized like we're in a pickle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the state of the nation is just so
messed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, we realized that when
anytime Babylon gets involved,
[SPEAKER_03]: it never turns out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of going back to our roots,
like of overplanet of just making seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: giving out seeds, trading seeds,
finding people in your community or
[SPEAKER_03]: finding websites, finding forums,
finding any way you can to connect
[SPEAKER_03]: Facebook groups, you know, discords to
make these, these connections and trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I mean, with the hoplite
that throws a little bit of a thing into
[SPEAKER_03]: it, but trade seeds then like,
and really, you know, people coming out of
[SPEAKER_03]: the woodwork, like that's one thing that
inspires me is going on to different
[SPEAKER_03]: forums, even though I'm not really active
because it's just been a little
[SPEAKER_03]: overwhelming for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do love to look at it and see what
people's doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even on Facebook, there's some wild
like forums, even on their people trading
[SPEAKER_03]: and people coming out from different parts
of the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, as, as things are getting
more and more polluted and more and more
[SPEAKER_03]: people are getting interested,
the education levels is gone down too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so things are getting, that's going to
be problematic as well, because you have
[SPEAKER_03]: all these people that are so excited and
are getting seeds from people in other
[SPEAKER_03]: parts of the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they may think they have something,
but it may have already been five
[SPEAKER_03]: generations down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was mixed with something else,
you know, kind of like Mexican genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go in and you're like, Oh,
actually the narco force already
[SPEAKER_03]: hybridized that one, like, you know,
25 years ago with skunk or, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's, it's really difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, the best place to ask your
grandparents, ask your friend's uncle,
[SPEAKER_03]: ask that crazy looking guy at the gas
station, ask everybody like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_03]: do you have any old seeds grow them out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a sativa thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is problematic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think, you know, maybe things I love,
there's like a, I'm kind of mumbling,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, but the whole New York city PIF kind
of revival and those guys kind of bringing
[SPEAKER_03]: that all back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, with all those older
hybrids, when people getting interested in
[SPEAKER_03]: that way, there's these new kind of
outcroppings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I call them almost see like the era of
land race or pseudo like heritage farmland
[SPEAKER_03]: race is kind of over.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's almost this new hype haze kind of
thing of people coming together and
[SPEAKER_03]: creating new, new sativas with older
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If, you know, if you listen to the plants
and you go deep, you can coax out all of
[SPEAKER_03]: the attributes that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and then as far as sativas that I
really enjoy, you know, I, I used to like
[SPEAKER_03]: edgy ones and then, you know, and now I'm
kind of in this category, I call it like
[SPEAKER_03]: spirit nourishing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking for sativas that you don't
even really feel like, you know what I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I've had a few smoke and just
like your day is better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe your music sounds cooler.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it makes you friendlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it just puts a little magic tinge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I was going through the
Vietnamese beams that I found the
[SPEAKER_03]: Vietnamese seven, and I think Doc D got to
smoke some of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one we kept was like a classic
psychedelic, beautiful Vietnam,
[SPEAKER_03]: old school Vietnamese, but all of its
sisters, there was ones that had the
[SPEAKER_03]: weirdest effects, you know, like ones that
would just make the music sound better
[SPEAKER_03]: ones where you would think you were high,
but you weren't, but your day just went
[SPEAKER_03]: better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost lubricated reality or almost was
put out like a field around you that
[SPEAKER_03]: brought in new experiences.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm all about finding these like
magical plants that are almost,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not just, you're not just getting
high or stoned or think you're creating,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, you're creating like an ally to let,
let it guide you through the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and if you have enough of these,
it's like you're each day, you could go
[SPEAKER_03]: walk with one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could go out into the world and you
know, and you see what it brings to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, but traditionally I like,
if we want to get back to the thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, I love Himalayan hand rub sativas,
like your classic, you know, Nepali and
[SPEAKER_03]: North Indian, like those are something
about the bright, joyful energy that they
[SPEAKER_03]: bring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I love some, some like, uh,
like maybe like Highland will hawk in kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of like from either up higher above or
kind of the coastal mountains that have
[SPEAKER_03]: that kind of really sunny kind of fun,
but psychedelic highs.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else do I like?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the Vietnamese.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had, I love that Big Sur Nigerian was
such a cool one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so strong and like, but it took you
and it was strong, but like in a friendly
[SPEAKER_03]: way, kind of like a big brother or
something like you were never like scared.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: At this point, there's, there's broad now
that we're kind of moved into this new
[SPEAKER_03]: nomenclature of narrow leaf and broad
leaf, it kind of frees you up a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: because there's a lot of, uh, narrow leaf,
like traditional kind of Indica style
[SPEAKER_03]: plants that have that experience to that
high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the beauty of the,
uh, the broad leaves is some of the most,
[SPEAKER_03]: like one of my favorites, I call them like
a, um, I used to have a term I used to
[SPEAKER_03]: call it, but it was, uh, when you smoke a
certain broad leaf that completely relaxes
[SPEAKER_03]: your body and euphoria and let your mind
and then let your mind go free.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, it's almost like these dreamy,
like traveling, journeying broad leafs
[SPEAKER_03]: where, you know, your head is completely
liberated and you're, and it's just so
[SPEAKER_03]: exquisite and beautiful, but you're
completely relaxed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I almost am again, I'm getting older.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really love that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, it's not so much sativa Indica,
it's finding these special effects and
[SPEAKER_03]: each person's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, some people smoke Indica and
they can't sleep for the next two and a
[SPEAKER_03]: half weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and then, you know, some people smoke
sativas and it totally chills them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's, you know, it's about
growing plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about planting seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about experiencing all these
different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can find these plants, just like
your friends and family, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you can't choose your family,
but you can choose your friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can choose your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can, um, find your niche.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find what really, um, nourishes
you and, and share that and, and also push
[SPEAKER_03]: it farther.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's something, a plant that just
you love, then work with it and try and
[SPEAKER_03]: bring that out and bring and let people
experience that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, long-winded answer on what my
favorite sativas are, but that's kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just that just enjoying the plant
spirit of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like just really just it's, you know,
it's our, it's our plant ally.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the dog of plants, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know, especially in this day and
age, it's like, we have a lot of these
[SPEAKER_03]: kinds of scientists breeders telling us
that we're doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're not using the right words.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, we've been doing this for
10,000 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Humans have been working with cannabis for
10,000 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not doing anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like a cannabis human love affair
that's gone on for thousands of
[SPEAKER_03]: generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't let anyone tell you you're doing
something wrong that you're not calling it
[SPEAKER_03]: the right thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's for everyone, whether it's
a grandma, I'm trying to make CBD auto
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers so that she can walk down the
street to visit her grandson.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it the guy that wants to shoot out
to meet the dogon, you know, it's about
[SPEAKER_03]: finding your heart and your connection to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me some of that spiritual
nourishment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so many things I have to
follow up on with that statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first one is that V at seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's still possibly the most
memorable, all, all of my most memorable
[SPEAKER_01]: weeds are coming from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the V at seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember if it was the lowland or
the highland.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the Pearl one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That the NL two, you know, so many of the
things you've given me are so,
[SPEAKER_01]: so, so memorable, but some of our fans
also were really interested in that V at
[SPEAKER_01]: seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, it's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most common question we got was where
did you get that seed stock from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I guess people were so impressed at
like, is it, is there an interesting story
[SPEAKER_01]: or is it just like, no, just, you know,
got some cool seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there is an interesting story.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is like something like,
if you're a good person, you put out a
[SPEAKER_03]: good vibe, like good things happen to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this, it was like, I think it was on
like icy mag forever ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this old guy, I'll be, he was like,
you know, and I've looked for him
[SPEAKER_03]: recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't find any of his postings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe someone knows him or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: He kept seeds from like the seven,
eighties on or eighties on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whenever you would go someplace and he
would bring them back and he's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I'm getting older.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have these really cool seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like them?
[SPEAKER_03]: I see that you preserve seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see that you have a good rep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, do you want these?
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I'm like, yeah, I would love
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do my best to preserve them,
to, to do whatever I can to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: carry this, you know, all the time and
energy putting it into collecting them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got them from him and I still have a
lot of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't cracked too many, but the
Vietnamese was the first one that I
[SPEAKER_03]: cracked into and that plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is that classic kind of like,
I guess it would be like that late
[SPEAKER_03]: seventies import.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got it there, but it's different than a
lot of the new stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it really still has its original
vibration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I always, you know, cause nature is
the ultimate selector, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: through its time and environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what it's, that's its hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it works with cannabis, it's
utilizing its environment and it's time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, that's, that's a lot of
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's so many unique inputs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's the latitude, the longitude,
the dirt, the people that tended it,
[SPEAKER_03]: the dew and the inhale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's a whole, and so it's like a time
capsule.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a teaching.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like it's song.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's, it's, it's almost like
it's living artwork.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like an access point,
like a vibrational access point where we
[SPEAKER_03]: can explore that culture, that time,
if we really open up into it and really
[SPEAKER_03]: feel like what it was also putting out,
you know, it's like a piece of art that
[SPEAKER_03]: you get to experience those, those really
timeless undiluted plants and their pain
[SPEAKER_03]: in the ass to work with their pain in the
ass to get their pain in the ass to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, and you know, a lot of times they
don't always, when they grow in a new
[SPEAKER_03]: environment, they don't always have
they're there, but you know, it's
[SPEAKER_03]: something about point of origin cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really encourage people to,
to travel, to experience these.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's traveling is a lot more
difficult these days and expensive,
[SPEAKER_03]: but if you can even travel on Facebook by
finding people that are also just trading
[SPEAKER_03]: seats is yeah, it's open your palette,
like grow all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can really understand what you
enjoy and how to work with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the basic story on the Viet 7
and this courageous and amazing guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be, you know, I'm going to,
I think now that I finally have a place to
[SPEAKER_03]: start up and work again, I'm going to
crack into some of his other seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had some Nepalese, he had some stuff
from Jamaica, a lot of Caribbeans.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had some Pakistan, he had these
Pakistanis that he said, Oh, these are
[SPEAKER_03]: better than that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: The kids are growing now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've tried to pop those and I can get
them to crack, but I can't get them to
[SPEAKER_03]: come up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but I still have a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm excited to, you know, I have so
many seeds I realized, and this is
[SPEAKER_03]: problematic too, because it's time,
you know, I keep them in the fridge,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'm right now, I'm trying to figure
out ways to not only preserve them,
[SPEAKER_03]: but to share them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I got a whole, I think I got a plan
brewing about opening up my collection to
[SPEAKER_03]: people, you know, I might, um,
you know, where I've been kind of thinking
[SPEAKER_03]: about this kind of like, even before we
were talking last night, like looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: my fridge, I can never, my kids,
my whole family, this entire town
[SPEAKER_03]: couldn't, couldn't sprout all these seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, maybe doing them through
Norica and people can, if someone wants to
[SPEAKER_03]: choose at once really that they've always
wanted to do, then they can grow it,
[SPEAKER_03]: make seeds and maybe send half back to
Norica.
[SPEAKER_03]: And drift to distribute them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if there's some kind of Bodhi seed
strain that's really old that everybody's
[SPEAKER_03]: wanting to try that, you know,
extinct, how lovingly give packs for
[SPEAKER_03]: people to F2 or, you know, I also might
dig into all the seeds that I've gotten
[SPEAKER_03]: from other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have so many different breeder packs and
thinking about maybe auctioning some of
[SPEAKER_03]: those on Great Lakes genetics,
just to kind of be able to afford a hoop
[SPEAKER_03]: house for next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to get my collection out before
it's too late.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also because I know a lot of these,
I know that kind of provenance and I can
[SPEAKER_03]: know where they came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know how I got them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can be reasonably sure you can ever
know really, but I know I can be more sure
[SPEAKER_03]: from stuff that I got 20 years ago or 10
years ago than I can now, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's a lot of seed reselling place
to get my own receipts from all over the
[SPEAKER_03]: world, but it's, there's no kind of,
there's no checks and balances.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I applaud everybody that does that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, I'm like,
Oh, this is kind of, this is another
[SPEAKER_03]: problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a beautiful problem, you know,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so exciting to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm sure there's a lot of people
out there who would be very down to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, sort of open populate or F2 in
some capacity, some seeds and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and give back and gosh, we're going to
have to loop back and talk about Norika,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I just wanted to quickly ask,
cause we had a few people interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: asking, and you're probably the only
person who I trust to give a good answer
[SPEAKER_01]: for this one, but you kind of touched on
it there, but like what, what advice would
[SPEAKER_01]: you give to someone who wants to be for
lack of a better words, like a modern
[SPEAKER_01]: ethical cannabis adventurer?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they want that land race
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: A, where would you say is a place they
could do it, but B, what are some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things they should keep in mind about,
you know, making sure that they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: inadvertently doing more harm than good,
so to speak?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all depends on if it's for personal use
or if they're going to spread it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I wish there were, you got a
little certificate with each time you,
[SPEAKER_03]: you got one, but no, I think the number
one thing is find a place that you've
[SPEAKER_03]: always wanted to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a connection to make sure that
they actually grow cannabis, but pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: much everywhere does except the North pole
or, um, and then make friends,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, spend some time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't just go, Hey, you got seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, um, like make friends with
the family that you get the seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: like make it a lasting relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring, bring pens for the kids,
bring antibiotics, like topical
[SPEAKER_03]: antibiotics being, bring some non
hybridized seeds that are safe for that
[SPEAKER_03]: area.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, share, just do whatever you
can and make them know that this is
[SPEAKER_03]: something special to you and it should be
something special to them and work from
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's not, I mean, there's so
many great places.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I, you know, if number one place,
if any, I tell anyone to go, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: a jaunt, but it's not super expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get there, go to Nepal,
like go, go trekking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: You hike four hours, you get to a tea
house.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are like, these are like beautiful
pathways going through the Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been there for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: You stop at all kinds of cool places.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's so much incredible ganja.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you don't have to have a tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always a place to stay and you
just get to blaze and just see the beauty
[SPEAKER_03]: of nature and be in these places and meet
cool people and make lasting friendships
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, smuggle some seeds back
wherever you need to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And um, yeah, Nepal, I would say great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, North India,
like the whole Parvati Valley,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's cool, but it's kind of,
it's got a, it's got an element that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that I don't think that's maybe seasoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really want to blaze, I think Nepal
has the biggest heart, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's so many cool places like
Thailand is opening up so much or so much
[SPEAKER_03]: cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: La Jolla, Vietnam, Mexico, Guatemala,
Belize, um, the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the only places that I would kind
of go that I've always wanted to go to
[SPEAKER_03]: like Mali in, you know, um, or maybe
certain parts of the Congo where it was
[SPEAKER_03]: like more pygmy tribes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, where else?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think of any place maybe if
you could, China's a little rough right
[SPEAKER_03]: now, but Xinjiang, the, you know,
on the other side of the stands,
[SPEAKER_03]: like Afghanistan, all those on the other
side of the mountains, um, used to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: big part of the Silk road.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's still some ancient stuff
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, there's not a lot of
places, but two, another thing is if you
[SPEAKER_03]: make friends with people that have their
interest in cannabis in Africa and South
[SPEAKER_03]: Africa and Guatemala, wherever you make a
friendship with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they usually, Hey, why don't you next
time, why don't you come visit?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, hell yeah, go make some
friends somewhere and, and smoke it there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, proof's in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's a feeling that you really enjoy
and you've never felt it before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the regular stuff you smoke,
it probably has a pretty good amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: heirloom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Genetics in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we're also reaching a point
where things are getting rapidly turned
[SPEAKER_03]: into a giant, uh, treasure chest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've never been one been able to do
like a selection at, at scale or field
[SPEAKER_03]: field scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel like at some point that's to
truly find unique things work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to get to that level because
there'll be like 500 different strains in
[SPEAKER_03]: one strain, which is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You imagine looking through like 2000
plants to find the most ultimate plant
[SPEAKER_03]: that just popped out of like a,
a cookies, gelato, GMO, Sherbert rents,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, strawberry, um, Manchi Chi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pakistani land race.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like throw that in there too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stick them all in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like that's what you find out in
the, you know, the, uh, the Kiva pass
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's, it's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, look at like greenhouse and they,
some of their exploits, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a little colonial and it's a little
bit, um, they're just goofballs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like, I don't even think they
have necessarily like, they're not being
[SPEAKER_03]: malicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just kind of like, do you like,
it's a totally different mindset.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I wonder, I'm like, okay,
but where did all those seeds go?
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys gave them some really cool,
um, gelato hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you bring back?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just such a strange new world and
it's beautiful and amazing, but it is
[SPEAKER_03]: really hard to navigate.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's people, uh, almost I just
wanted to give big ups to all of the
[SPEAKER_03]: people, you know, like Deepak and,
um, all these young people that are so
[SPEAKER_03]: super passionate that are in, you know,
it's like, there's the guys that Kevin
[SPEAKER_03]: Drogy went with in Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's that Babakoo in Afghanistan,
all these people that are really going to
[SPEAKER_03]: these places that we would never going
with a huge passion and a huge dedication.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really doing the work and writing
things down, trying things, saving things
[SPEAKER_03]: in places that are probably the last
places on earth that we can still get pure
[SPEAKER_03]: lines, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really think that it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, there are people are popping up
all over the place and they're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do this too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that is really noble pursuit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it is quite amazing and
beautiful that we have these, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: these other kind of expressions popping
out of this current situation that is,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's almost like a, a saving grace in a
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of the things that really
resonates a lot with what you just said is
[SPEAKER_01]: the, uh, the importance of those organic
friendships.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually remember it was, uh,
I think maybe mid 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was talking to Deepak, uh,
Urizen for anyone listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, man, I'd love to go walk
around Nepal a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, we started chatting about it and
then, you know, sadly COVID-19 hit just
[SPEAKER_01]: shortly after.
[SPEAKER_01]: So never came to fruition, but it speaks
to what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you were saying, like, you know,
those organic friendships are often what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to help sort of get you to,
you know, I love the idea of doing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's such a foreign idea, but to have
someone there on the ground, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, what an awesome thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, uh, that, that's really cool to
hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just reminded me the last time we
spoke, it was so long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was before you did that really cool
Indian trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember much?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it was a minute ago, but gosh,
it seemed cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was, um, so that was the ARD
Kumbh Mela.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like the half Mela.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the crazy thing is, um, in January is
the Maha Kumbh Mela again.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the 12 year one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm doing everything I can to try and
get me and my wife there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's finances are a little, um,
skit, but, uh, if anybody wants to go,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a great place to go experience,
but okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll cycle back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the last half Mela, um, I met,
um, uh, Deepak Erzin and his amazing and
[SPEAKER_03]: super cool friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like deep, um, snake magic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's means like deep snake magic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always so bad with names.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's yet such a cool friend, like,
uh, Naga spirit realms or how it gets one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know his handle, but it's like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has snakes in it and deep and ancient.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I met those guys at the Kumbh Mela,
which is for people that don't know it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's considered like the world's largest
spiritual gathering.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of, I think it's like 250,000
times, no, 250, 2500, 2500 times bigger
[SPEAKER_03]: than Burning Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, I literally had to buy a bike last
time I was there to get around because it
[SPEAKER_03]: would take me like eight hours to walk
into the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it has 150 million people come
during the event.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just, it's the most incredible
place because people are there at such a
[SPEAKER_03]: high vibe because it's the place all
everybody in India is like the Kumbh Mela.
[SPEAKER_03]: It supposedly it you bathe on these
certain bathing days and the rivers,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's three rivers that kind of meet up and
it's all astrological and it removes all
[SPEAKER_03]: of your, your karma and really infuses you
with, with deep like, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: transformational magic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I met up with those guys at the Mela
and we stayed in the same camp and they
[SPEAKER_03]: were so cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would go out and go hang out with
the Baba's and look for a new tents.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they brought the most insane hash
ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was blowing Baba's minds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like these people didn't know what,
like that casual, all the stuff you saw
[SPEAKER_03]: them post, like the Kashmiri and stuff,
just a big bag, like their place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our camp was a put on by a guy named Rade
Baba.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was this amazing old Sadhu and he was
so stoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had all of his Baba bubbies come and
they would just get, they would blaze them
[SPEAKER_03]: up and we'd be singing and, um,
yeah, it, it was, it was such a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mela itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was doing kind of like, I know people
are going to be like loses kind of a,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, how do you know when you collect
these seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would do like Baba, we would go to
Baba camps and we'd smoke chill them with
[SPEAKER_03]: them and share.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we smoke something good,
they flick the seeds all over the place
[SPEAKER_03]: when they're packing their things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be like, where are you from?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your name?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are you from?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I would pick up the seeds and I
would write their name and write wherever
[SPEAKER_03]: they came from because they're from all
over India places and they usually don't
[SPEAKER_03]: come out of the Hills they're using.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they usually have pretty good stuff
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's way, way out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I came back with maybe 20 different
Indian seed lines from all over India from
[SPEAKER_03]: each from different Babas who that was
their own personal stock or their own
[SPEAKER_03]: personal best stuff from the area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like this massive like
collection point and just the experience
[SPEAKER_03]: of just going around and at night it's so
wild and amazing and smoky and there's
[SPEAKER_03]: thousands of these camps and all different
kinds of spiritual pursuits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like there's, I don't even know how to
explain it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's really unexplainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you could watch a video on YouTube
and see it, but it's literally like the
[SPEAKER_03]: most ancient burning man you could ever go
to.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's been, they've been doing it for
like, I think 1500 years and it is
[SPEAKER_03]: incredible and wild, but it's intense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, everybody you have to
poop, everybody's pooping everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to use your hands as toilet paper,
use mud, which my, uh, my kids always give
[SPEAKER_03]: me a lot of hassle for, Oh dad,
did you really use your hand?
[SPEAKER_03]: And like it told it super works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you would use mud instead of soap.
[SPEAKER_03]: It pulls everything off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's like, it's kind of like using
charcoal on your hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's a little TMI, but um,
you know, and you got to watch out what
[SPEAKER_03]: you're eating and drinking and you know,
there's a lot of chill them cough going
[SPEAKER_03]: around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was, that was that experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was kind of like the best big
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we went on a couple, I think I
went to, um, Oaxaca with the Adams stray
[SPEAKER_03]: and doc or no, we went to Guatemala after
that, you know, we've gone on a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: trips together, us three doing
collections.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to Guatemala and then we went to,
uh, Mexico on two different trips to
[SPEAKER_03]: collect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's always fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that last big India one,
that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I posted it on a breed Bay and
maybe a can of cabana and a few others to
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of give people, keep people by,
but I got to bust into those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I have so many seeds I collected on
my own that I just popped some purple chit
[SPEAKER_03]: tree that are 20 years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was surprised that they popped,
but I still have Nepali seeds from 20
[SPEAKER_03]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's time to everybody that's
got old seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, get them going or give them to
someone that can, because now's the time
[SPEAKER_03]: we're reaching in all the old,
you know, all the, all of these incredible
[SPEAKER_03]: old timers are leaving our, this reality
they're beaming up, you know, it's time.
[SPEAKER_03]: For their time, you know, bodies are,
are finally letting go of their spirits
[SPEAKER_03]: and with them, all those seeds,
all of that notch is leaving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I feel like this is the time
that shake up a big kind of transition
[SPEAKER_03]: point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we really need to, as a community come
together and create something for the
[SPEAKER_03]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I too am looking at cracking into some
old seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage everyone to do the same and
beautiful to hear about.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the pilgrimage that sounds like it
was a blast and a bit of a culture shock
[SPEAKER_01]: for some people like myself, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to follow up on that, I saw on your
Instagram, you'd posted some photos and
[SPEAKER_01]: you said, Oh, these are some Rajasthani
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were they from that trip?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what, what would they like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think of all the land races,
Indian, they're, they're so like
[SPEAKER_01]: undocumented.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like a lot of people, including
myself, it's like, I just don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: know what they're like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, well, that's the cool,
like if we were talking about spirit,
[SPEAKER_03]: nursing plants, um, some of those
Rajasthani plants are really unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are duds and some of them are
really incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, um, the, I think the last time there
was a Baba that was, uh, Rade Baba is one
[SPEAKER_03]: of his good buddies that lived in the
area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he brought an entire, he got a car,
he brought an entire truckload of this
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff called Mount Abu.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they call it like Mount Abu mango.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what they would smoke all day
long.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just sat here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somehow he made it all the way there like
Cheech and Chong adventure, but they don't
[SPEAKER_03]: really mess with Saudis, but isn't
basically the whole back of his car filled
[SPEAKER_03]: up so he could share because, you know,
at the Kumbh Mela, you want to bring your
[SPEAKER_03]: best stash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also like the, you know, Babas are
like kids, you know, and there's,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, 99% of the Babas are just,
uh, basically Shaggy from Scooby Doo.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't do anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: They become Babas and there's only like 1%
that are super like you know, that have
[SPEAKER_03]: cities that have powers that have these
connections to states that we don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so it's, it's pretty fun, but this guy
had a little bit of everything and he
[SPEAKER_03]: connected, but he loved his ganj.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Mount Abu mango was from that,
that's that batch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Deepak got some too,
but I got some seeds from another Baba
[SPEAKER_03]: called Rajasthani Sikar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made that Rajasthani space probe with
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the strains I made, I think that
was like a supernatural selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk about like spirit nourishing that
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't, it wouldn't knock you down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't make you super high,
but it just had this clarity to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, and it had such a delicate smell,
like this kind of floral insensi,
[SPEAKER_03]: almost like, I like Nag Champa,
but like, um, if you ever smelled like
[SPEAKER_03]: Magnolia, like a red Champa, like just
this beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's such a beautiful fact effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very feminine and very like,
um, it just was a day brightener,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it wasn't, you sometimes almost not
know if you smoked it or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that, you know, I'm thinking that
some of those, they're pretty much,
[SPEAKER_03]: and Rajasthan is pretty much a desert that
that's a totally untapped kind of,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, genre or like our, our section of the
Indian, uh, cannabis gene pool that needs
[SPEAKER_03]: to be explored.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know when in India, there's a place,
I mean, sorry, Nepal, there's a place
[SPEAKER_03]: called the Trites, Lilland jungle,
they have rhinos and all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like kind of like Africa in a
way, like the Savannah's and they have a,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, the people that live in the Chitwan
and Bardia national forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I forgot what they call, but they
trace themselves back to gypsies from
[SPEAKER_03]: Rajasthan and they brought their ganja
with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's like a super narrow leaf,
um, like, uh, uh, almost jungle ganja
[SPEAKER_03]: plant that actually at one point was a
desert plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And over time and environment,
that plant that you would get in like just
[SPEAKER_03]: an arid environment has now turned into a
total jungle plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was really amazed with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, that plant also has a really
unique effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know how things work,
but then this is a whole nother subject
[SPEAKER_03]: about, you know, old plants in new
environments, but there are some really
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing plants out there just in spots
that people haven't really looked,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and it's a lot of times they
don't get you super roasted.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like, you know, that's what hash
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they just give your life something
special, you know, they're just a little
[SPEAKER_03]: gift.
[SPEAKER_03]: They become part of your culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that gives them a lot of
magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess it sort of goes without
saying that you don't know what you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stuff that we haven't
given enough attention to, and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: just probably not aware of how,
how interesting it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you were talking about the spirit
nourishing stuff or like, one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that jumped to mind straight away
was last time I saw you, I was lucky
[SPEAKER_01]: enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gave me some pink boost goddess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a, what a soul nourishing herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you, can you tell me a little more
about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I only recently learned a little more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, I still feel like it's
criminally underrepresented and under
[SPEAKER_01]: known within the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I, I don't know a tremendous,
but I can tell you what I do know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's, it's one of those
cultivars that's, that's super rich in
[SPEAKER_03]: THCV and this amazing woman up,
I believe she was in the triangle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ava would probably even know, sorry,
no more.
[SPEAKER_03]: She found, this is kind of the story I was
telling you for, she, she found a plant
[SPEAKER_03]: that she really liked and she didn't
worked with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she not only was kind of doing a
plant, uh, she, her breeding process was
[SPEAKER_03]: based in science and spirit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like she would connect to the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like talk to the plants, do kind of
like a plant spirit communication and work
[SPEAKER_03]: in that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, and she would also test your
plants as kind of a, as a backup queuing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way she did that, as she moved and
she progressed, she created this
[SPEAKER_03]: incredibly high THCV cultivar,
um, using her, her in innate like sensing
[SPEAKER_03]: abilities and connection to nature and
cannabis, um, along with science.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it's an amazing, it's amazing,
amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I don't know, you can call it cultivar
strain, whatever it is, is really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had a little bit of a hay day
because people kind of got smoked and
[SPEAKER_03]: like, wow, but it, I haven't heard as much
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those things you would think
would be everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, big up to, to people that,
that find their passion and their niche
[SPEAKER_03]: and make incredible things for the
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that stuff's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for me, I found it like,
it just felt like the perfect sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had just this awesome raciness to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if that's what THCV is
like in general, or if that was just the
[SPEAKER_01]: way it affected me, but it was,
it was so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I was lucky enough to be talking
to Mojave Richmond just the other week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know they offer it with the breeders
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was hoping maybe it would make its
way into like some facilities or
[SPEAKER_01]: something, but I guess we'll just have to
wait and watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this whole topic, it gets me thinking
that, I think even, even now really,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the sort of innovative strains,
you know, the new strain to become the
[SPEAKER_01]: next big popular thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like even though big facilities
have been around for quite a while now,
[SPEAKER_01]: it still comes from like the small time
producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the thing that jumps straight
to mind is I know that it's been around
[SPEAKER_01]: for forever, but like, you know,
things like Mac and, um, some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: strains like trop cookies and all the
stuff over the past sort of 15 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all just come from small home
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it doesn't seem like the facilities
are, you know, putting out new strains
[SPEAKER_01]: like you'd expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I thought if you're going to
have a big facility and you pop a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, you're bound to find something
really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess my question is I'm now starting to
think that it'll probably stay that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That the new cool things will come from
the home grower, the passionate,
[SPEAKER_01]: the smaller operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think facilities will ever actually
start putting out new stuff like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the next big GMO strain is like
from a facility or do you think it'll stay
[SPEAKER_01]: with the passionate smaller guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I mean, all we have to do is kind
of look back in time and see where all the
[SPEAKER_03]: best strains have come from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it's bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's like electric Larry down
the street who's been selling since the
[SPEAKER_03]: seventies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's, it's these, all these
little growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's these people that took two packs of
their favorite stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And today it's like, I think it's always
going to come out of these little pockets
[SPEAKER_03]: of, of care and creativity.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I know there are like mid-level
producers that do do phenol hunts and are
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of chasing your lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, like JBZ, he does all of
his own things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think cap, he, they do a lot of
phenol hunting and testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you find that, but I still think
like the new, new or all, or anything
[SPEAKER_03]: that's truly unique is going to come out
of just the most, the places you would
[SPEAKER_03]: never think because, you know,
because that's how it happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just, it, it high it's a treasures that
are just needed to be hunted and they hide
[SPEAKER_03]: in different spots and creation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't always think it's, it's a field,
a field selection kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, you know, maybe if, if scientific
reading was so cool, then why is there not
[SPEAKER_03]: any cool scientific strains?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, they've call come from people
that buy seeds online or her traded.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's always treasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have to look, it's like panning
for gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone can go down to the river and get,
and if you have a little sleuth and you
[SPEAKER_03]: find a cool spot, you'll get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's not, it's, it's for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like cannabis has been like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if you just have your heart turned
on and your mind in a, in the right place,
[SPEAKER_03]: like it's, it's ripe for picking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would hope that new things are going
to come along.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope that big facilities will do
these, these hunts, but all I see is like
[SPEAKER_03]: the bigger kind of seed companies and the
bigger facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just kind of do goofy things like
make triploids or things like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's like, why do we need all
these things?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we've been doing this for 10,000
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said that before.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, we have a love affair with
cannabis, just make out with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's like, do your thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's there, you know, don't listen to all
these other goofballs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just find your niche, open your
heart, blaze your way into a new world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree with everything you've said.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's certainly the passionate ones that
are, that are driving things forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, it's undeniable,
but something I wanted to ask while we're
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of at that intersection of,
uh, you know, spiritually nourishing
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and, uh, modern hype stuff,
is there anything recently, even gosh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the last time we chatted was about
seven ish years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got a long time for recently that
sort of impressed you or maybe something
[SPEAKER_01]: you didn't expect to be impressed by.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that I get lots of messages from
people who are still surprised that Tom
[SPEAKER_01]: Hill said he really liked gelato 41.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there are certain plants do
amazing things for certain people,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that the hype strains,
it's, I think there's great benefit in
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like it's, they're really good
for enjoying video games.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really, they're like an MSG for a
modern urban, um, life, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they take the edge off, you know,
they're fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hang out with your friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of, it can be competitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can have a little gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you can go to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's a whole pop art kind of
situation taking all different strains and
[SPEAKER_03]: putting them together and doing the thing
and hanging out with your friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I see the benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's kind of a soul multipurpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I think hype modern hype strains go
for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I think that's super cool that people
are finding joy and finding solace in this
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of, of emergent kind of, uh,
ultraviolet kind of glossy pop art.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how many different kinds of noodle
soup cans can you make styled the same
[SPEAKER_03]: string?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and now, but to loop back,
what were we, what was the question?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just went into, I just went totally into
the hype mode and lost my whole train of
[SPEAKER_03]: thought there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what, what are some strains doesn't
even necessarily have five strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's some stuff that's impressed you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe unexpectedly impressed you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me think.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did I see that I thought was kind of
cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Oreos, um, is, uh, you know,
it serves its purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It helps people grow in, in conditions
that are harsh and it's quick and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: very frosty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the smell isn't necessarily my
favorite, but I got to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I sometimes I get to go over to when I
live by the ocean, I got to go to Hayes
[SPEAKER_03]: Valley a lot and I get to see some of the
new stuff and some of the Oreos.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hybrids were really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was, I was pleasantly surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they had the frost level,
but they had new smells.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I like some of the, like, um,
the burgery stuff kind of like skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: master makes some fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what else?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can of ore had some cool ones,
like karma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I got to see a lot of neat stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like just people that are finding
their niche and not just smashing things
[SPEAKER_03]: together and throwing it out, but kind of
finding that plant that they really dig
[SPEAKER_03]: and then kind of introducing that plant to
all of the hype.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like taking your nerdy friend
who's super good at something and bring
[SPEAKER_03]: them to meet a bunch of cool kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they all, you know, they all kind
of hang out and something new happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to think of what I really liked.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one, what was it called?
[SPEAKER_03]: It had a Spanish name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I, to tell you the truth too,
I've been kind of a hermit these last
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of years and it's been a little bit
challenging.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I haven't had to expose her that I used
to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I haven't had a garden for the
last two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I'm trying to think of what really
inspires me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should go back down there and see what
was the one that was really cool recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last time I was down there,
it was getting to smell some Orioles
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrid, but actually it was a really good
use of, of hybridization, like showing
[SPEAKER_03]: that you could take a plant that had
everything except the smell and taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: And fusing them together and actually
getting a plant that's, that's better than
[SPEAKER_03]: the two parents combined.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you can get two things and put
them together and you get something better
[SPEAKER_03]: than the two, like go for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you just, you're a big winner there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you did it, you know, and I think
that's what it's all about is,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, making a mountain out of a
molehill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can definitely find some
really nice crosses in, in anything
[SPEAKER_01]: really, but yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Orioles got big for a reason,
you know, it's obviously got some stuff to
[SPEAKER_01]: offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Earlier on in the answer, you referenced
the work you do with Hayes Valley Nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure people have seen it on your
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool to have the collaboration
ability with them to see what you can do
[SPEAKER_01]: at scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, do you have any plans to give
them any stuff to see them run through it
[SPEAKER_01]: or how, what's your thoughts on future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to try to get any,
anything in particular you want to see on
[SPEAKER_01]: big scale?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, well, they're rerunning a lot of
the stuff that was the best, like the
[SPEAKER_03]: cream of the crop from last time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I gave them a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's harder since I, I moved to kind of
get, it's, it's like four hours away now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a little bit more difficult,
but I would love to go down soon and see
[SPEAKER_03]: how the new trials are coming along.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do those late season trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, they are so kind and they're
such amazing, beautiful people and they
[SPEAKER_03]: have their heart in the right place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just do it for like the love and
passion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's this huge Bay and it pretty much
they don't can't do it's just the labor of
[SPEAKER_03]: love growing all these old and ancient
plants that are barely finishing,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like just getting to see them
and experience them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's a huge financial issue,
but they do it for the love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's the way I think it should be,
you know, and there's so many things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I pray that I always work with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're good friends and good family and I
love what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and they kind of saved me
in a way, like when I didn't have a
[SPEAKER_03]: garden, that was one of the few places I
could go and be with the plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and really, and people,
good hearted people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just be there and look, you know,
around, put, you know, where you got the
[SPEAKER_03]: little piece of colored plastic that they
tie around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I was pink and someone else's
yellow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can mark the plants that you
liked and kind of watch them progress.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like it is so, you know, it's,
it's such a mental health boost to be with
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you get all the oxygen,
you know, it's like plants are healing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you hang out with a lot of cannabis
plants, like it's like going into a
[SPEAKER_03]: hyperbolic oxygen chamber and just the
vibe, like it's so soothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And calming.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's so much, so rich with volatile
essential oils that are just doing,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, who knows what they're doing to
your system, but you feel good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know, the, the notion of a,
the Japanese have that forest bath where
[SPEAKER_03]: they go on hikes through the like high
pine forest and they just come out and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like, it's better than Prozac for
these people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go in having a hard day.
[SPEAKER_03]: They walk out the end of their hike and
they feel great because they're getting
[SPEAKER_03]: the oxygen.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting the piney, which is all
stimulating and enlivening like getting
[SPEAKER_03]: around plants is just, you know,
I think that's one of the greatest gifts
[SPEAKER_03]: that we have as humans is to be able to
tend gardens to, you know, going back to
[SPEAKER_03]: the original garden, that's the garden
planet where the stewards, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it could be Adam and Eve.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, or Adam and Steve, whatever
you're into, but just make it,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's so cool to hear that you
were still able to get that fix,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, shout out to Ryan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was lucky enough to hang out with him a
few times when he's been down under.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome to hear, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, while we're on the topic of plants,
tell me a little bit about what you've
[SPEAKER_01]: been doing with plants lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: You referenced earlier that you've had a
few around after having a break.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you at?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you sort of looking at going
forward?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well now, I mean, it's kind of like,
I have to kind of do the backstory and to
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to sell the front end of the
story, but I'll try and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try and make it quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take your time.
[SPEAKER_03]: How I'm going to explain this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been about three years and,
you know, massive transformations and
[SPEAKER_03]: challenges for Bodhi seeds and friends and
family.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we had to leave the farm
and we did a mass exodus to the Sierra
[SPEAKER_03]: foothills, which is about four hours away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we used to be in the Santa Cruz area in
the Redford forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're up in the Oak forest,
you know, and there's a lot of trials and
[SPEAKER_03]: tribulations, a lot of losing plants,
losing hair, losing my eyesight,
[SPEAKER_03]: losing dogs and kids farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?
[SPEAKER_03]: My musical equipment, the Bodhi Seeds
computer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there was a lot of surrender and a
lot of, I don't know, it was kind of like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost felt like some of the families
that felt that would go start in like
[SPEAKER_03]: Oklahoma and make that trip in the covered
wagons to California to pay them for gold
[SPEAKER_03]: or go to gold country.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're in gold country.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after all these trials and tribulations
and not having a garden and doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: unique things along the way, like the
cookies experience that was brought on by
[SPEAKER_03]: that whole exodus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So through many trials and tribulations,
we made a massive exodus to the foothills
[SPEAKER_03]: of the Sierras.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're here now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We moved here with my mom, who we took
care of while she was passing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we have this beautiful piece of
land.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a diamond in the rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: We grew our first little outdoor fruits
and veggies garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quite hot here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I definitely have never been in this
kind of heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I thought hot was 85 degrees down in
Santa Cruz, but we had some days that were
[SPEAKER_03]: in the hundreds, 110s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, the joys of that is like,
I really dug it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, plants, that's hard to keep
bugs at bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's hard to keep things going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, canvas loves hot
temperatures, but it was something I
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't super ever experienced or exposed
to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a workshop now and some tents in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The workshop stays about 99 degrees,
which is, you know, I get a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: a it's like a sweat lodge combination.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I sweat out a lot of toxins
while I work, which is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just got our first little first round
of kind of test plants gone off and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, haven't had a haven't had a
space in two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only times got it really had a had a
space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, someone just texted me right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically, Diamond in the Rough got a
great new spot and hopefully next year
[SPEAKER_03]: will generate enough income to create like
some outdoor space, like a little hoop
[SPEAKER_03]: house or to really get some projects
going, because before we moved there was
[SPEAKER_03]: so many visions and dreams and projects
that were ongoing just about to kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: kick into gear and everything we want to
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, life changes and life
progresses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And life takes you in so many amazing
places you never thought you would.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would take you and that's it teaches
you things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes you a better person.
[SPEAKER_03]: It creates the the the, you know,
the true essence of who you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I feel so honored to be someplace
where I can find me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Start and restart all those visions and
dreams and projects and yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I'm sorry to hear about
your your mom passing six months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just sounds like, as you said,
a truly a transitionary sort of time for
[SPEAKER_01]: you in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess we're all just so appreciative
that you're sort of feeling that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: coming back to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know everyone would be more than
happy to get on board with any projects
[SPEAKER_01]: you launch in the near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: In consideration of how it would fund
future project goes without saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to hear, you know, what might be
something people can get excited about in
[SPEAKER_01]: the near future, because I'm sure even
even just beyond the fact that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: hearing it's going to go towards further
projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people are just keen on your work
just just for the inherent genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: What sort of stuff would you have in mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do you have some of the old
faithful males or have you moved on from
[SPEAKER_01]: some?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I lost a tremendous amount
of plants trying to take them from Santa
[SPEAKER_03]: Cruz here through the different houses
that we had to inhabit on the way here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was a it's always hard to lose
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I always feel like losing
plants is an opportunity to move on and
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe move into something that is that's,
you know, just way too exciting for you,
[SPEAKER_03]: like just a thing that's truly going to
inspire you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always think, you know, if you lose
parent stock, it's time to move on and
[SPEAKER_03]: there's and it lives on and all its
hybrids and stuff, you know, so most all
[SPEAKER_03]: the males are gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: The old males, which is good, too,
because, you know, they were getting old
[SPEAKER_03]: and I was a little worried about the HPLV.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can never tell when plants are
getting super old what unless you test
[SPEAKER_03]: what's really going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you think what, you know, a few plants
have made it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The funny thing is the plant I think I've
had the longest Stevie Wonder,
[SPEAKER_03]: I call it Stevie's Wonder or now I call it
Saints Crossing just so I don't get busted
[SPEAKER_03]: by Stevie Wonder's estate because I like
Stevie Wonder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll mess with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had that one for 20 plus years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I think it got made in 2005.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one of my that's my oldest clone
that I still keep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: But not really.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of the old males make it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all new males and all the new stuff
that I'm going through.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what like I think I'm trying to think
of like what we're really the basis of
[SPEAKER_03]: what we're trying to do is to kind of
preserve and inspire like preserve all of
[SPEAKER_03]: those special plants that there may be in
the fridge or and then also inspire people
[SPEAKER_03]: to to utilize those plants and to really
follow their path, because I always feel
[SPEAKER_03]: like it's like I'm you know, a strain or
cultivar is kind of like an Afghan rug.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like it's a weave.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you start it and you kind of
pass it on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone works on any other family part and
someone else.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like we're a big family.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all working on everybody's working
on each other's work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just tapestry that moves through
lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I've done a lot of line
work and I make a lot of tools for myself,
[SPEAKER_03]: but predominantly I always would make
hybrids, you know, because I thought it
[SPEAKER_03]: was the best way for people to kind of get
involved and get involved with it is just
[SPEAKER_03]: is grow this out, see how cool it is,
if you like it or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't let it go.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do, then move forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take it to F2, like really break it down,
see the parents, see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like what you're seeing,
then move it in the direction that you
[SPEAKER_03]: really love and get it out like
experiences like take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like it put your own outfit
on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like make it yours and really,
I don't know, just just go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think cannabis should ever be
there should be no limits.
[SPEAKER_03]: There should be no shackles.
[SPEAKER_03]: There should be no one saying,
oh, you can't do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's fair if you sell like
F2s for profit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you sell F3s, go for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, you know, it's like just put your spin
on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm having my, you know, when you get in
your head so much that your your mind,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like when the mind opens,
the mouth closes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess, look, just just a quick one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like is it is it the case that if there's
a certain strain out there from say,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the 88G13 mail that someone was
really fond of, like you should probably
[SPEAKER_01]: go buy that if you can find it because
it's it's not it's there's no more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's a limited stock that left.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I don't I think most a lot of strains
that are extinct.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like on Oprah and Grow and stuff,
they have a whole this is like big up to
[SPEAKER_03]: all these people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this is incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like a bode co-op F2 group that
F2s all kinds of rare packs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, that is the raddest thing I've
ever heard, ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like it's so I think that's one of the
most awesome things I want to like send
[SPEAKER_03]: old packs and be like, hey, are you guys
looking for this?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to fire up this pack,
go ahead, preserve it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I think that's the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can ask for a better compliment than
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people wanting to preserve work that
that I've done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just I'm just one hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm literally it's like I made it's
almost like making rice and saying,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, now it's your turn to like add the
curry or, you know, it's like it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: that's kind of a weird analogy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's it just feels good to know that
people want to preserve something you
[SPEAKER_03]: made.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then with that, be able to give that
out, give it out for free, do whatever you
[SPEAKER_03]: want trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then people make new stuff with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's the very essence of what
our cannabis culture should be.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be this caring inspirational
cooperative, like working together to to
[SPEAKER_03]: give everybody everything they need to
create exactly what their heart desires
[SPEAKER_03]: and their creativity affords, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course, that I think that's the
best way to to get noticed as well for
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone out there who's like looking to
build their rep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder then, have you have you got
anything that sort of piqued your interest
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of males you've got at the
moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it just still very much in that
initial phase of, you know, nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: standing out quite yet, still searching
through things?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, today I was in the mail room and
I was going through all this stuff and I
[SPEAKER_03]: counted I have about 15 new males.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I need to whittle them down
to about 12 or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's so many cool things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing a lot of work with all the
I like kind of like DLA ask stuff like old
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghani hybrids, like there was an M8
which is the Hairspray Kush Pakistani.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing this triad with my three
favorite ones, the A1, the Angel Wing
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghan and the Big J Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that male is incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like Jurassic Park, like
dinosaur, like don't get too close to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like feed me, see more.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to it's going to I think that's
going to be really special.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?
[SPEAKER_03]: I did a bunch of like non released DLA's
that I might make for as F2's like the M8
[SPEAKER_03]: Hairspray Kush Gash or 88G13.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?
[SPEAKER_03]: I even I think I even wrote that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I did like a UW A1.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did a HP 13 A1.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did a like a DSP that ages Afghan A1.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been getting into the pipeline stuff
that's where the blood like the dragon's
[SPEAKER_03]: blood was kind of derived from.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a beautiful Vietnamese black I have
this really cool old Big Sur Holyweed
[SPEAKER_03]: Congo Counted Hearths from Vision Creator
that are so amazing, beautiful kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: like that really smell like the old Big
Sur Holyweed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's so many what I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did a bunch of Lavender Lemonade hybrids
just to kind of check them out so I could
[SPEAKER_03]: make sure see if they're ready to kind of
filter out for release.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an old 90s hash plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff from Charlie like Mextiza.
[SPEAKER_03]: I busted out the chocolate trips.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did the Afghanistan gold stars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to think of all the things that I
just they're just about to get flowered in
[SPEAKER_03]: the new room.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of on the tip of my brain
what's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some killer orgasm stuff which I like a
lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the work I did for Burner believe
it or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took I took an extra step to try and
find I want you know it's and let's see
[SPEAKER_03]: what the what was it was that Skittles
Lavender Lemonade and I took it to F2 and
[SPEAKER_03]: did a big hunt to find something that I
really wanted because I would like to have
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to get that that seed line to
just get lost in in the shuffle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you know I decided that I'm going
to find a really killer specimen and let
[SPEAKER_03]: it out into the wild so people can
actually I think that was a really cool
[SPEAKER_03]: line.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just it just you know it had a hard
release and to get that out I think I
[SPEAKER_03]: might even offer it back up to cookies
saying hey this is here's your baby you
[SPEAKER_03]: know this was a special time in history so
they can have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else have been doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh I've been doing the new dragon soul
work which I really like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the pine soul dragon's blood.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think all the different
weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of older lines like Tskinti
I have going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some Purple Kush Old Mother Gani.
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did some Purple Kush King's Cross and
then the next round is more kind of like
[SPEAKER_03]: preservation like the purple chit trees
from Nepal and then getting into some of
[SPEAKER_03]: my old stock that that I found with the
app you know with Docty and Stray when we
[SPEAKER_03]: went on our two hunts like a lot of some
of the Guatemalans and some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Oaxacans and then so much cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been going through my seed collection
like breaking it down like what I think
[SPEAKER_03]: people like to use that I might not use
like so many cool things you know all
[SPEAKER_03]: kinds of old J's that people like I've the
original cap you know Mac I have so many
[SPEAKER_03]: packs of Billy Goat stuff like all the old
stuff all the all the old breeders from
[SPEAKER_03]: the overgrow days you know like I think we
have three little birds and Jojo Rizo and
[SPEAKER_03]: so many old lines that are just so we're
so cool that just need to come back so
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just been a big you know whenever I
get down I just go and I big take out the
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds and I like to just dig through seeds
and I get excited when I see some of those
[SPEAKER_03]: packs I haven't seen in a long time but
it's like I don't want to be like Gollum
[SPEAKER_03]: like seed Gollum like my precious like you
know I might I'm gonna keep like a tenth
[SPEAKER_03]: of my collection to work on but you know I
want people to be able to find cool stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think that was the whole the whole
reason that that that I went through the
[SPEAKER_03]: cookies experience like that wasn't that I
thought that was going to be the coolest
[SPEAKER_03]: thing ever like extreme possibilities like
f1 hybrid where it's taking the best the
[SPEAKER_03]: best infrastructure or the best whatever
you call that like whether you have the
[SPEAKER_03]: most reach there's a name for it well
cookies is a marketing force and I thought
[SPEAKER_03]: if I could bring in these plant these
totally new plants we could basically kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of like a gravitation only blast away from
this conglomeration of plants that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: just taking over the planet and we could
create something really special new yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: we could talk more I know people always
want to know about that I'm sure we could
[SPEAKER_03]: talk more about it and I know a lot a lot
of street cred on that one but yeah I had
[SPEAKER_03]: to see beyond the whole experience or
maybe we'll just talk about that in a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit I can start from the beginning
because I know that's something people
[SPEAKER_03]: always ask me about but back to the
original question of what I was doing yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the current stuff and then I have a
lot of cool medicine mountain lines and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's kind of my likes it for work also
working on a secret new company called I
[SPEAKER_03]: guess if I call tell you what it's called
it's not secret but it's called yab yum
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's kind of gonna be like it's like a
hype company like I'm gonna try and make
[SPEAKER_03]: really cool new hype things out of totally
different plants than anyone else has and
[SPEAKER_03]: try and squeeze them into the the general
populacy community and see if we can like
[SPEAKER_03]: get some new flavors and fresh new funky
stuff happening you know that sounds super
[SPEAKER_01]: exciting is it is it just yourself in that
one is it is it pronounced yab yum yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: yab yum is like it's a I like it's a funny
word it's a it's in kind of Buddhism it's
[SPEAKER_03]: the it's the the mixture of wisdom and
compassion and you usually see it as as
[SPEAKER_03]: it's usually like a female yogini and a
male and they're sitting on each other's
[SPEAKER_03]: laps kind of like in that in like a
lovemaking position I don't know if you
[SPEAKER_03]: seen it's like it looks like a you'll see
like a lady Buddha sitting on the like in
[SPEAKER_03]: there in lotus and he's kind of sitting on
her lap and they're in this kind of it's
[SPEAKER_03]: basically it's like a coital metaphor for
the fusion of wisdom and compassion so and
[SPEAKER_03]: it has such a funny and fun name so I
thought that's great yab yum I love that I
[SPEAKER_01]: love that ooh so we've got something to be
excited about then yeah and that's like a
[SPEAKER_03]: little side project I think the first I
might even send out some testers of those
[SPEAKER_03]: two people like in the community just so I
could you know get some really good
[SPEAKER_03]: feedback on that edge because we haven't
had a tester program in so long and I tend
[SPEAKER_03]: to like think every plant is cool so I
always try and find there's always a
[SPEAKER_03]: redeeming character in every plant I look
at I'm like oh wow I love the smell it'll
[SPEAKER_03]: be like you know it'll have like you know
you get like a gram out of a whole plant
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like oh this is really cool but it's
like you know there has to be a balance
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah I think the first the first seeds
are already done I made three different
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrids with this male that is kind of
going to be the first flagship of this new
[SPEAKER_03]: endeavor and then and more medicine
mountain does just take forever because
[SPEAKER_03]: you're working with like these long
flowering sativas it's a little bit more
[SPEAKER_03]: of a labor of love and I think this year
next season if I can break the heat a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of those will be coming out and I also
want to do a lot of preservation work like
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a few Charlie's lines I bless his
heart I guess I don't know I haven't heard
[SPEAKER_03]: from him in a long time I mean he I
thought he might be in Colombia or stuff I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know if he's still around but I
would love to let people try some of those
[SPEAKER_03]: you know like to skinty and mextiza and I
have a bunch of different lines from him
[SPEAKER_03]: you know the Vietnamese black from Billy
Go is an amazing line I have so many cool
[SPEAKER_03]: things that I'd love to just you know
people that I respect that I feel like
[SPEAKER_03]: their their lines are kind of disappearing
you know the people never in fact it kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of got like a gray area you know where
people if people weren't around in the
[SPEAKER_03]: like early 2000s they don't really
understand or even in the 215 era how much
[SPEAKER_03]: more cultivars and how much more variety
we had it's kind of like a the fruit
[SPEAKER_03]: market fruits and vegetable markets at the
turn of the century like it what it was
[SPEAKER_03]: there like 126 apples in 19 or 1895 or
something and now we have six to eight
[SPEAKER_03]: apples in stores you know because they're
the ones that don't bruise they they stay
[SPEAKER_03]: on the shelf longer they think they're not
the tastiest of this we've totally totally
[SPEAKER_03]: eliminated our gene pool for convenience
and capitalism so I'd like to just bring
[SPEAKER_03]: back some variety and really allow people
to experience like it I think that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: best education is experience and I pray
that you know I see a lot of other people
[SPEAKER_03]: doing it too and I think this is one of
the ways that we can progress into the
[SPEAKER_03]: future where we have a very vibrant and
magical cannabis gene pool again yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: totally totally and I think something that
really resonates with what you said at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end there is you really do have to
experience it because a lot of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: memorable experiences that have really
changed my perceptions and thinking wow
[SPEAKER_01]: like some of these land races can can
actually be just so otherworldly it can't
[SPEAKER_01]: be articulated really you know and you're
trying to explain it to someone but you
[SPEAKER_01]: just you know words words aren't enough so
I agree that's that's awesome on on all
[SPEAKER_01]: fronts and I want to ask you you mentioned
a few times we'll we'll loop back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: cookie stuff but I want to ask you you've
mentioned the Big Sur Nigerian a few times
[SPEAKER_01]: we had a few people who were really
interested to hear a little more about it
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's Australian that's shrouded in
a lot of sort of mystery can you just tell
[SPEAKER_01]: us a bit of the backstory and what it
smells and looks like because I know you
[SPEAKER_01]: made a few hybrids with it so maybe for
anyone who's ironed those off yeah so
[SPEAKER_03]: another good resource for this too is
Mojave because he grew up there and he
[SPEAKER_03]: knows all about these things but basically
I had a friend Mike who kind of uh was a
[SPEAKER_03]: friend of a grower down there and what was
that other guy I don't know I'm supposed
[SPEAKER_03]: to say his name but there was a lot of
people amazing growers that grew down on
[SPEAKER_03]: the ridges over Big Sur and Mike got these
seeds in the I think mid 80s and he had
[SPEAKER_03]: them forever and he he's an older guy I
think he's probably in his 80s now he
[SPEAKER_03]: found these somehow in his old stuff and
he had three seeds he got two up in his
[SPEAKER_03]: little house he has a little low rent
house he put them under like a little
[SPEAKER_03]: fluorescent light and I think one of them
went up and then another one went up it
[SPEAKER_03]: said it said he took him about a month in
a little flower pot and he one of them
[SPEAKER_03]: died shortly after but he brought me down
this one to kind of preserve he's like hey
[SPEAKER_03]: I have this this this Big Sur this
Nigerian see that we used to grow in the
[SPEAKER_03]: 80s and I've got it up it's like it's a
miracle it's like I don't know how I did
[SPEAKER_03]: it like and so he gave it to me and I kind
of nursed it back to health and nursed it
[SPEAKER_03]: up and it was one of the coolest plants
like it was it was relatively quick you
[SPEAKER_03]: know I think like 12 weeks maybe you know
you could take it at 10 it was such a
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful amazing structure like so loves
outside so beautiful like you could tell
[SPEAKER_03]: like it loved my area because I'm pretty
close to Big Sur and just this wild kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of like metallicy kind of herbal meaty
herbs de provence kind of sagebrush esque
[SPEAKER_03]: smell but just kind of smell dangerous
like it just smelled powerful and it was
[SPEAKER_03]: like it just had the greatest effect like
it was so powerful was so great in hybrids
[SPEAKER_03]: like it would really just take over in a
good way and you know when anytime I
[SPEAKER_03]: really wanted to kind of get out there on
like on a ledge I would I would smoke it
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know I had it for a while and it
you know did a couple different hybrids
[SPEAKER_03]: and using a lot of different things
because I loved it so much and you know I
[SPEAKER_03]: tried everything I could but eventually I
lost it you know along with the v7 and a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of plants lost I had the house that we
moved from after the farm was in this
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing beautiful house and it held
everybody in and we could have the animals
[SPEAKER_03]: there and stuff but it was the worst place
to grow there was this little garage it
[SPEAKER_03]: was so damp and it was so funky and it was
so impossible to clone and do anything
[SPEAKER_03]: there and I think it died in a tray like I
would take like 20 cuts of all my
[SPEAKER_03]: favorites just so that I'd know I'd get
like one out of the deal and I think that
[SPEAKER_03]: was one of the times that some kind of it
got infected or something but I lost a
[SPEAKER_03]: whole tray of like my favorite it was just
like it was really tragic so it lives on
[SPEAKER_03]: in hybrids it's just one of those original
old 80s Big Sur Africans you know they had
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that they grew quite a bit of
Africans and Mexicans I mean there's a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm you know I didn't grow up there and
there's people that know a lot more but
[SPEAKER_03]: from what I've heard you know strings like
Dolores and Chamba and this Nigerian and I
[SPEAKER_03]: know what we used to get a silver pearl
that came out of there and they had a
[SPEAKER_03]: Durban that came out of there when I first
moved to Santa Cruz like you'd always get
[SPEAKER_03]: really special stuff that came from Big
Sur it was people that really did it for
[SPEAKER_03]: the for the love and you know it had it
was a very special environment you know so
[SPEAKER_03]: it made really cool plants but basically
the gist is it really cool old African
[SPEAKER_03]: that acclimatized itself in Big Sur
brought back to life by a really great guy
[SPEAKER_03]: who lived in that area in that time that's
some really cool backstory and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: people have to pop those seeds it's got to
live on for sure and yeah another question
[SPEAKER_01]: that you know you sort of referenced it in
the past answer when you were talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about various males we had a lot of people
who were keen to hear more about this
[SPEAKER_01]: lavender lemonade male what can you tell
us about it well that's kind of cool like
[SPEAKER_03]: you know when I started to get you know as
I went to more and more to wallflower I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean Torito Ridge which turned to
wallflower and it turned to Hayes Valley
[SPEAKER_03]: all the same people just that that that's
that journey of sharing with them and
[SPEAKER_03]: sharing clones and getting to understand
nurseries and everything it was so
[SPEAKER_03]: fascinating it really opened my eyes to
the whole world of like commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: production like my brain was never really
in there I was a hermit like I wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: creating plants for nurseries or for
commercial production I was just kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: following my bliss and trying to bring out
the best possible plants from where my
[SPEAKER_03]: connection to the plant was but I got
fascinated with like you know plants that
[SPEAKER_03]: had to finish in a certain time that had
to look a certain way that had to be
[SPEAKER_03]: resistant to these things that had to be
able to even though one thing that really
[SPEAKER_03]: blew my mind is oh this has to go through
a trimmer I'm like oh so I this plant I
[SPEAKER_03]: thought oh this plant super rad
everybody's gonna want this and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: like oh it's not gonna go through the
trimmer right I'm like what what kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: you know I just had all these epiphanies
so I started on making trying to make kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of a line that I thought would be really
cool for for big-time production and so I
[SPEAKER_03]: know and I was back when the turp that
everybody was like turped up supreme like
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody wanted like we're very you know
all everything at hot was like citrus and
[SPEAKER_03]: like you know orange and lemon lime you
know because we come from the land of
[SPEAKER_03]: lemon tree and everybody just that seemed
to be the thing so I'm like oh cool I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: you know I could do lemon tree and wookie
two extraordinarily turpy strains and try
[SPEAKER_03]: and make something that would encompass
both of those but even better like I
[SPEAKER_03]: really wanted to get the structure down
like I always you know structures great
[SPEAKER_03]: and all but it wasn't always on the top of
my list for for breeding so that one was
[SPEAKER_03]: like it was primarily making something
that was structurally easy to to grow and
[SPEAKER_03]: also to have the look and the smell that
everybody wanted so I worked on it for a
[SPEAKER_03]: while and grew out different ones and we
even had a couple really cool females that
[SPEAKER_03]: went around and and and it kind of
culminated eventually in you know into the
[SPEAKER_03]: line that I thought would be perfect for
for cookies they could you know like they
[SPEAKER_03]: they were but they're so big on you know
aromas and tastes and flavors but it could
[SPEAKER_03]: be something that could really revitalize
part of their their their shtick kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: like their their jam and so that's how it
kind of worked into that and so a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: these lavender lemonade hybrids that are
coming out were kind of made in it really
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking kind of like the commercial
market or the nursery market or just
[SPEAKER_03]: allowing people to have plants that maybe
have these really exotic turps that aren't
[SPEAKER_03]: going to just flop over and just you know
something I don't know it's just something
[SPEAKER_03]: new I'm always trying to push myself into
these new places and new realms that you
[SPEAKER_03]: know to really see what I can do and it it
was kind of my version of my first kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: foray into like kind of making something
like hype like something that everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: would like that could be moved through a
commercial situation and also that was
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of when I was losing the farm too so
I was also thinking of other ways to like
[SPEAKER_03]: well how can I apply myself I don't I
can't I'm not growing like how can I apply
[SPEAKER_03]: myself to be the best thing I can for the
community and and also be able to generate
[SPEAKER_03]: income to do the projects like what what
can I what can I move into and I really
[SPEAKER_03]: thought for a while like I was really into
I'm like strain design that sounds so cool
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have you know it's a it's kind of
a labor of love making seeds and having
[SPEAKER_03]: big mom rooms like you don't ever get to
do anything and you know any time I'd ever
[SPEAKER_03]: travel I'd always lose like so many cool
plants like it's kind of like but it just
[SPEAKER_03]: has to it just has to happen sometimes so
the strain design part was was really a
[SPEAKER_03]: cool challenge and it it really opened my
mind and allowed me to see deeper into the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis as a whole I realized I was kind
of myopic just being a little bit hermetic
[SPEAKER_03]: and not focusing on the bigger picture and
by moving into that commercial space you
[SPEAKER_03]: know it was fascinating and I kind of I
enjoyed pushing myself and and learning
[SPEAKER_01]: about it and creating something for it
yeah yeah definitely and I can I can see a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred percent where that comes from you
know I I think I'm exactly just as guilty
[SPEAKER_01]: as you you know sometimes I've I hang on
to these plants that are just nightmares
[SPEAKER_01]: to trim and and people tell me and we're
not even in the commercial setting I want
[SPEAKER_01]: to ask you a bit of a random one quickly
it's it's almost undeniable that the
[SPEAKER_01]: general market demand and trends has
shifted very significantly towards
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized seeds especially over say you
know it's been happening for a while but I
[SPEAKER_01]: think in the past five years there's been
a dramatic shift even among home growers
[SPEAKER_01]: and generally speaking their willingness
to grow regulars I think you're probably
[SPEAKER_01]: quite immune to that because you've got a
very specific sort of clientele who who
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy regulars and there's always going to
be like pretty much anyone listening to
[SPEAKER_01]: this show is always going to be happy to
grow regulars because we're just like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know that sort of enthusiast level but I
do wonder have you thought any more about
[SPEAKER_03]: feminized at all you know it's just it's
it's just not my thing I guess I'm just
[SPEAKER_03]: old school I'm kind of coming from like
the Luther Burbank style there's so many
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing breeders that do it it's I think
it's a really cool tool especially on old
[SPEAKER_03]: plants that you may maybe only have a
female and you want to preserve it it's
[SPEAKER_03]: really cool to open up the the genes of a
plant to see what it possibly could be and
[SPEAKER_03]: to search out its parents like it's the
ultimate kind of like crack the code like
[SPEAKER_03]: go in and and you know it's like a
forensic tool and you know I always think
[SPEAKER_03]: like inspector like he's he's the probably
the best most devoted and brilliant and
[SPEAKER_03]: you know s1 worker that I know of like he
really does an incredible array and vast
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of work and he does a good job and
that's his thing and like I respect people
[SPEAKER_03]: that they find their niche and they find
what they can do well and they go with it
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah I'm just a I'm kind of just like
the old wizard on the hill and just do it
[SPEAKER_03]: the old-fashioned way and you know I
thought at one point when that when there
[SPEAKER_03]: was a I guess the band-aid seven one a
pifcon or something like that and there's
[SPEAKER_03]: all that hoopla I thought oh that might be
fun to like partner up with someone and do
[SPEAKER_03]: some like a band-aid haze feminize like
with all kinds of the cool sativas I think
[SPEAKER_03]: I even talked to Rita Ridge maybe I'm
sorry I still call them radio rich because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's we go all the way back to that haze
valley all those cool sativas that we
[SPEAKER_03]: found in the last big hunt kind of mixing
it up with the band-aid seven but you know
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that just we haven't really
moved forward on that and I don't know I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: just not a big s s1 guy yeah maybe I could
just shorten that up and just say yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: just I I appreciate all the directions
that people go and and I have great
[SPEAKER_03]: respect for all the people that find their
niche and that's feminize seats just isn't
[SPEAKER_03]: mine and I think it's amazing I have been
known back I think it was 20 years when I
[SPEAKER_03]: got the stuff on eBay and I mixed it up
all the STS and I just basically roasted
[SPEAKER_03]: the hell out of all my plants and I
thought well that was no fun you know I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know I don't like to mix up
chemicals I don't you know alchemy I do
[SPEAKER_03]: like inner alchemy but outer alchemy is
not one of my strong suits and yeah the
[SPEAKER_03]: coolest part about it is I realize is you
know if you have two verified cuts you can
[SPEAKER_03]: make the same seeds as like you have a
thousand people get the you know get runs
[SPEAKER_03]: and and cookies the two cuts and feminize
them and everybody will have the same
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds yeah I think that's how it would
work so I mean that's kind of cool like it
[SPEAKER_03]: really levels the playing field you can
you know I think maybe in the future now
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just rambling but s1 super cool I mean
no actually not super cool I how about I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: not gonna do any s1s in the future but I
really appreciate everybody that's
[SPEAKER_03]: involved in that work and I think it's
kind of cool doing the s2s and threes and
[SPEAKER_03]: all that and I know that's how they do it
in scientific breeding but I just like two
[SPEAKER_03]: plants making love and getting to
experience all their kids when they come
[SPEAKER_01]: out totally totally totally I love what
you said there like I mean I myself I make
[SPEAKER_01]: fems and I do weird stuff like that but
you know what's interesting like it took
[SPEAKER_01]: me a while I had a bit of the hippie guilt
about like I've come to accept that like
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself you know I like f1s you know I'm
happy to do it as a femme but I like that
[SPEAKER_01]: f1 generation the most I've toyed around
with others and there's just something
[SPEAKER_01]: magical about that first recombination
with especially diverse genetics coming
[SPEAKER_01]: together you get something really
interesting there and that's what I love
[SPEAKER_01]: the most for sure so I'm definitely on
board with you in that sense and and even
[SPEAKER_01]: amongst that answer it's come up a few
times actually you mentioned the the the
[SPEAKER_01]: guys running pifcon and I guess by
extension you know the the Cuban black
[SPEAKER_01]: haze which has really had a massive
resurgence over the past say three or so
[SPEAKER_01]: years and and shout out to the guys who
run pifcon it's one of the few successful
[SPEAKER_01]: like heady events that I haven't been to
it but everyone I speak to has gone is
[SPEAKER_01]: like yeah it's it's like really it's like
what the Emerald Cup was doing back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day you know just like cool people really
good herb unique effects and then when you
[SPEAKER_01]: also put this in contrast with the fact
that you got people like you know Tom
[SPEAKER_01]: Hills recently come out with his haze Todd
McCormick's doing his thing with the haze
[SPEAKER_01]: and and top dog is also doing some haze
and you know very haze heavy sort of work
[SPEAKER_01]: what's your thoughts on the resurgence of
haze specifically and in my mind I think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's either down to like Cuban black haze
or super silver haze is gonna sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: become the new front runner they're
definitely both really rising back up do
[SPEAKER_01]: you have any thoughts over which one might
be the bigger of the two contenders to be
[SPEAKER_03]: reinjected yeah I don't know I mean
there's so many fresh new minds and heads
[SPEAKER_03]: and people creating these new hazes I
think it's amazing I think it's so cool I
[SPEAKER_03]: think that you know pifcon that is people
rallying up for like heady highs like that
[SPEAKER_03]: is incredible and it kind of harkens back
I think we talked about this a long time
[SPEAKER_03]: ago about how those heirloom sativas
coming in when hip-hop was first starting
[SPEAKER_03]: and in New York like a lot of that early
hip-hop culture was was fueled by these
[SPEAKER_03]: like Colombians and Mexicans and these
like haze you know haze type plants like
[SPEAKER_03]: that were really you know they were
sparking the minds and and really filling
[SPEAKER_03]: the streets and like having that it's just
like another expression of people it's
[SPEAKER_03]: heritage it's basically it's a cultural
it's a cultural treasure hazes in New York
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think what an amazing beautiful
place for that that pifcon to happen and
[SPEAKER_03]: how cool is that I mean what what hazes
are gonna be popular and if future I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know I think ones that have the most
unique effects like super silver haze if
[SPEAKER_03]: it is like that if that is kind of like
the working man's haze like there's
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing quite like it just the smell the
structure the way it is I mean it maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not the headiest but it's just it
checks all the boxes it's a truly
[SPEAKER_03]: extraordinary plant and then by default
like Neville's haze which is kind of like
[SPEAKER_03]: the more crazy grandpa there that's you
know it's hard it takes longer it's harder
[SPEAKER_03]: to grow and it you know it has that more a
little bit more refined and then the Cuban
[SPEAKER_03]: black that we grew that that was such a
wild plant like it was so big but it would
[SPEAKER_03]: take a while but it would get so big and
it was it had that unique kind of effect
[SPEAKER_03]: of like it still had some of its northern
lights in it you know by giving it that
[SPEAKER_03]: big structure but it had such as beautiful
kind of buoyant headspace but I think the
[SPEAKER_03]: future of hazes is gonna be in people
doing really cool stuff like you know Doc
[SPEAKER_03]: D works it does a lot of cool hay stuff
and like nobody's nursery they do it and I
[SPEAKER_03]: know all those PIF guys like they're all
kind of pushing your art JJ comes up with
[SPEAKER_03]: cool stuff like and I see a lot of the
people overseas like you know Sammy and
[SPEAKER_03]: like some of the gold guys on icy mag and
then there's the guy the white buffalo
[SPEAKER_03]: guys in Canada those guys are awesome what
they're doing like those yeah it's it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a really incredible and of course he
saw his pictures of him pumping out his
[SPEAKER_03]: new round like it's beautiful it's very
heartwarming and it's very cool to see
[SPEAKER_03]: that there's that that's kind of bubbling
up I don't know what's gonna be the best
[SPEAKER_03]: you know and and people like you know I
read some of the comments like Band-Aid 7
[SPEAKER_03]: that's not even a haze and I'm like it
wasn't about haze I guess the PIF cons
[SPEAKER_03]: about PIFs northern lights haze I don't
think I don't think Band-Aid 7 is
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily that exciting of a haze but
what it is is it's a is like an a1 primo
[SPEAKER_03]: working man's sativa guys like bread and
butter like kind of it's like the steak of
[SPEAKER_03]: haze it's prolific it smells good it has a
stoning effect you can work on it it's for
[SPEAKER_03]: people that smoke a lot of ganja I think
it hits just right and that you know and
[SPEAKER_03]: in this state in this environment of the
states and Holland and New York and all
[SPEAKER_03]: these places like the new environment
that's putting the selective pressure on
[SPEAKER_03]: it is the youth the culture the like you
know the music the the underground and I
[SPEAKER_03]: think I think it's gonna be this cultural
icon that that really serves as this
[SPEAKER_03]: vehicle to really move people into a
positive direction for the future with for
[SPEAKER_03]: for really heady herb so kudos to
everybody involved I think it's so awesome
[SPEAKER_03]: and rad I think everybody should throw
some hazes at some point and I think we
[SPEAKER_03]: should have them back in the marketplace
and I think people should be striving to
[SPEAKER_03]: make greater and greater versions and
unique offshoots and whatever because yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: I think haze isn't it's one of the truly
it's one of the greats that we have in our
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis heritage yeah a hundred percent
and you know obviously shout out to our
[SPEAKER_01]: former episode guests you know Tom the the
white buffalo guys and you know Sammy
[SPEAKER_01]: those guys obviously doing killer work
with the haze while we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: haze just a quick little cheeky one I
remember ages back I was talking to you
[SPEAKER_01]: and you sort of joked around about the
idea of doing a haze recreation with snow
[SPEAKER_01]: high and kagu have you have you thought
about it because as time goes by I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: I ruminate on that thought I'm like oh I
really hope they do that yeah yeah I think
[SPEAKER_03]: we've been doing it for about 15 years now
it's like every year it's like okay we I
[SPEAKER_03]: think Michael he's he's the most gung-ho
on it he's like sure yeah you got you got
[SPEAKER_03]: your plant ready for the things you know
John did his two years ago like he is he's
[SPEAKER_03]: a force of nature he's always getting
everybody to get involved like I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know I just moved like I'm always have
some like you know I some it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: supposedly we're like handing off plants
and I think it's gonna do it in its own
[SPEAKER_03]: time but it's definitely it's been started
and it's gone through a couple iterations
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think I might have dropped the ball
here and there and I think John probably
[SPEAKER_03]: dropped the ball but it is it is you know
it's out there it's in the ethers it
[SPEAKER_03]: hasn't fully germinated yet but it is
something that that is close to our hearts
[SPEAKER_03]: that we should be working on so thank you
for putting a fire under my butt on that
[SPEAKER_01]: one no no I'm sorry I I agree with you
it's still it's still happening it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just progressing at the rate it needs
to progress out yeah you gotta have a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of space and you got to have a lot of oh
yeah time and you got to have the right
[SPEAKER_03]: environment people are they don't that I
think it turned off about hazes is hazes
[SPEAKER_03]: you got to look through a lot of hazes
like that's that's why I hazes are so cool
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not like hazes are you gonna pack and
they're these awesome plants hazes like
[SPEAKER_03]: the ultimate treasure hunt it's like the
it you know if you want to find a good
[SPEAKER_03]: haze you're gonna have to look through a
lot of plants and that turns a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people off and you know I don't just give
me a like if you gave me a vial of a
[SPEAKER_03]: thousand original hayseeds that's not
that's not something that I want to do you
[SPEAKER_03]: know I don't want that's a lot of work so
I think also finding these special cuts is
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna be very beneficial because yeah
that's a lot of work that's the one
[SPEAKER_03]: drawback and I think that's the one reason
why haze really caught on it's a pain in
[SPEAKER_01]: the ass yeah of course that's a big
commitment to make and it's understandable
[SPEAKER_01]: on the practical scale people are a bit
apprehensive in in the last answer when we
[SPEAKER_01]: were talking about PIFCON I wanted to ask
because there's there's this interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: situation at play in New York where
there's undeniably this huge renaissance
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis especially in regards to
like talking about the PIF and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: those guys in the real heady scene but at
the same time the sprayed pack phenomena
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene infused cannabis is also clearly
got a stronghold in New York there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people more so the average punter
acknowledgeably who are very very much
[SPEAKER_01]: into this sprayed pack cannabis and the
thing that I find the most interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: about the spray pack phenomena is that
people are not oblivious to it like
[SPEAKER_01]: they're very aware that that's because
that was the immediate knee-jerk reaction
[SPEAKER_01]: was like oh they don't know but a lot of
them are in fact almost everything I've
[SPEAKER_01]: seen on it says that people are aware and
it's interesting that there's a podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: out there that's just specifically about
rating various sprayed packs I thought
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a sign like that's how mainstream
this is so I'd love to know what your
[SPEAKER_03]: thoughts on the sprayed pack terps is that
amazing is that the craziest wild thing
[SPEAKER_03]: that you've ever heard I mean I think it's
in that I mean then also you have all like
[SPEAKER_03]: that the TH what is it Delta A or was it
you know all the I think that's wild like
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a slurpy culture it's like it's junk
food it's like fast food it's like it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like pop art it's like you know people
don't care what they put in their body so
[SPEAKER_03]: why would they care what they put into
their lungs I mean I think it's it's cool
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can come out with the weirdest
wildest thing I don't even know what do
[SPEAKER_03]: they use real turpines they use real
essential oils like what did they spray
[SPEAKER_03]: them with like do you just get some
Febreze or do you like go get some some
[SPEAKER_03]: like you know like some citrus all over I
mean what they is there companies that
[SPEAKER_01]: sell the spray like mix it up I mean I
guess I'd love to like the my
[SPEAKER_01]: tongue-in-cheek answer is is this just not
what people were doing back in the day
[SPEAKER_03]: when they chucked orange peels in with
bags yeah serious yeah tortilla tortillas
[SPEAKER_01]: and orange peels right right but no so I
recently had a sticker farmer on the new
[SPEAKER_01]: show I've been doing with me and Gene and
he's tied in with the guys who sell this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff so he knows all about it and he said
that the stuff they spray on it is the
[SPEAKER_01]: same flavored solution people use for like
nicotine solutions for vaping so you get
[SPEAKER_01]: like so it's just that same like viscous a
food grade artificial flavoring and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like a machine that sprays it on it so
yeah not not like plant-derived or
[SPEAKER_03]: anything like that that's so wild Wow I
mean I wonder what do they what kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: ganache they sprayed on just like just
just the back just the booth for like is
[SPEAKER_01]: there a special strain that they like to
use interestingly enough what he said was
[SPEAKER_01]: that of course yep there are definitely
people trying to you know sort of polish a
[SPEAKER_01]: turd but he said the companies that are
doing the best are actually putting
[SPEAKER_01]: quality product in and then spraying it
which is really quite sort of perplexing
[SPEAKER_03]: well I know like companies like app like
some of the big terpene companies like was
[SPEAKER_03]: like abstract sector what all those
different ones that sell or what was the
[SPEAKER_03]: old and clear water or what are those
places that sold turp mixtures and you
[SPEAKER_03]: could add them to your carts or but or
whatever I guess that's the same kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: thing but so what does that do if if
they're spraying it so I always say like
[SPEAKER_03]: the terpenes are the plant story you know
it's it's what it's it's trying to tell
[SPEAKER_03]: you so by spraying it I don't know I mean
you want to maybe we should try and get
[SPEAKER_03]: you some so you can do a you can do some
bioessing and tell us if you notice any
[SPEAKER_03]: difference is it kind of like remember
when like all those research cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_03]: like jwh-118 and all those different wild
ones and people would smoke those like
[SPEAKER_03]: what if you use that and the spray
together and do put it on like those old
[SPEAKER_03]: high times 80s like centerfold remember
the fake buds you could buy in the back of
[SPEAKER_03]: the magazines yeah like on you could just
spray fake cannabinoids and then the spray
[SPEAKER_03]: and then put it on like mulling or some
kind of like a real healthy lung herb you
[SPEAKER_01]: know I feel like we've we've sort of cut
out the middleman there and it's at the
[SPEAKER_01]: point now where I hear that many of the
like the the cheapest sort of cart you can
[SPEAKER_01]: buy are essentially like mostly terpenes
and some sort of filler and a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of Delta 8 or like you know what I mean
like it's almost at the point where it
[SPEAKER_01]: it's what you're describing it's like
there's nothing real there well it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: cheap beer I mean I think we just reached
that we've reached the lows of kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: like are just the capitalistic lows of a
product you know people want the the
[SPEAKER_03]: cheapest possible experience and then
people also want the highest like pinnacle
[SPEAKER_03]: of experience and so we have the complete
bandwidth to work with now yeah I wanted I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to ask you I've been I've been very
much thinking about this idea for a while
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've been sort of slowly getting more
and more into wine and the thing I think
[SPEAKER_01]: about the most is like how come no one
breeds in wine anymore and then I started
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about that in the context of
cannabis and I'm sort of thinking do you
[SPEAKER_01]: think like we're gonna get to the stage
where everything will be so bred to
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically suit a certain production
style that like over a longer period of
[SPEAKER_01]: time not a short period of time but a
longer period of time commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: production turns into like what wine
production is where it's like there's just
[SPEAKER_01]: like these 30 or 40 recognizable varieties
and even of those it's like eight of them
[SPEAKER_01]: are just by far the most common of them
all and it's just what is considered you
[SPEAKER_01]: know and it'll be like OG will be like
Chardonnay and Runts is like Merler you
[SPEAKER_01]: know what I mean where it's just like
there's just a few things do you think
[SPEAKER_01]: that is like a possible risk or do you
think like it's it's too variable it won't
[SPEAKER_03]: ever get like that I think it kind of is
like that I think it's just that it
[SPEAKER_03]: rotates a lot faster than than grapes and
stuff you know is like it says it seems
[SPEAKER_03]: like there is like 60 main cultivars and
they go on kind of in and out and they
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of cycle through and go into the you
know and they're always kind of cycling
[SPEAKER_03]: out I don't because we don't have a
there's not a vast palette or maybe we're
[SPEAKER_03]: wrapping up rapidly moving into that stage
I mean it's the same thing that we have
[SPEAKER_03]: happened with all of our fruits and
vegetables it just gets to the point where
[SPEAKER_03]: profit takes hold and you know I mean
we're I think we're kind of doomed in that
[SPEAKER_03]: regard I think the only way we're going to
be able to get out of this is to just get
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody just everything just throw see
do this and then also you know maybe a new
[SPEAKER_03]: model like a like a direct-to-consumer
where small farms that have grown like
[SPEAKER_03]: something really beautiful behind their
family for so long and they're really
[SPEAKER_03]: proud of it and they do organic inputs
they can have a website and sell their
[SPEAKER_03]: story and sell direct in the mail to
someone that really wants to experience
[SPEAKER_03]: that or farmers markets or you know I
think we're in we've said it we're like
[SPEAKER_03]: we're basically set up to fail and we kind
of just have to ditch the whole system and
[SPEAKER_03]: go back to like you know before
prohibition cannabis prohibition everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: grew it ganja it was every where it was
used for everything 10,000 years it's been
[SPEAKER_03]: used for everything it's like why not
let's just go back to that make it make it
[SPEAKER_03]: our you know our main ally plant grow in
your front lawn do ornamentals do CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: plants do whatever don't don't get don't
let the the government take a hold of this
[SPEAKER_03]: one or big business like do people really
want I mean it's cool to go to dispensary
[SPEAKER_03]: and see everything but even if you have a
friend you always have that funny friend
[SPEAKER_03]: guy that has the garden in the back oh
check out my tomatoes like you know
[SPEAKER_03]: there's always someone in your group and
that's that's gonna want to grow so I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know I think that it's just
grassroots at this point is to just kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of grow down Babylon it's like it's not
gonna get any better and it's only gonna I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know I it's I used to have a lot of
faith that you know that there would be
[SPEAKER_03]: people that do it so much for the love
that they were willing to take the biggest
[SPEAKER_03]: financial hit barely make any money but
produce this most amazing stuff at the top
[SPEAKER_03]: and then there were people big
corporations that would make the most
[SPEAKER_03]: spoof stuff at the bottom and it would
just wipe out the whole middle but I think
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just everything is it's just erased
in the bottom and I don't see things
[SPEAKER_03]: getting better and I don't see any
legislation that is helping at all it's
[SPEAKER_03]: it's sad so yeah to answer that question I
mean spraying packs is that that's just a
[SPEAKER_03]: natural that's just a natural expression
of where we're at you know and it's it's
[SPEAKER_03]: fascinating it's kind of cool it's it's
kind of avant-garde it people love new
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff you know if their lungs melt or
something from I just wonder what's in it
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what and what kind do they use
what do they use as a carrier it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: propylene glycol or something really gross
yeah certainly certainly I share some
[SPEAKER_01]: similar concerns and and and you know the
race to the bottom sentiment is a real
[SPEAKER_01]: concerning one as a super quick follow-up
do you do you think that that rescheduling
[SPEAKER_01]: of things to schedule three made any real
difference and and do you think that
[SPEAKER_01]: federal legalization is is gonna make much
change because it seems like it's coming
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty quickly yeah I mean with all this
everybody in the elect who knows with the
[SPEAKER_03]: election every all the different political
figures are saying they're gonna do this
[SPEAKER_03]: and that I think they should do schedule
like just make it back to a plan again and
[SPEAKER_03]: rescheduling it so the pharmaceutical like
kind of level is gonna screw everything up
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's also you know I try always trying
to find a silver lining it also gives
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody that wants to grow a lot more
freedoms because it's not gonna be like it
[SPEAKER_03]: it takes it down a few notches for
enforcement like you're not gonna get so
[SPEAKER_03]: shafted at at three as you would at
schedule one so it kind of gives everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: a little more freedom to just go berserk
and just grow gonge everywhere do whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: they want because it's gonna be on it's
already kind of unenforceable we're
[SPEAKER_03]: reaching reaching that omega point where
someone it's so part of our society now
[SPEAKER_03]: the cats out of the bag it's like taking
it to three is gonna suck it's gonna mess
[SPEAKER_03]: up everything it's gonna be so bad for all
the people that spent so much time and
[SPEAKER_03]: energy to get to where they're at but it's
also gonna give everybody more freedom to
[SPEAKER_03]: to just you know who cares about all the
laws just go for it just do what you want
[SPEAKER_01]: totally totally totally it feels like
we're at that point almost you know it
[SPEAKER_01]: won't be long before before every state is
legal and and then I'd really be
[SPEAKER_01]: interested to see him what the mass sort
of producers are doing you know when the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to be in every petrol station
is a gas station is suddenly an option you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to imagine there'll be there'll be
like supply issues at first and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll be making the big facilities and
it'll be interesting yeah I mean isn't the
[SPEAKER_03]: Delta 8 market like bigger now than the
than the regular market isn't it's some
[SPEAKER_03]: crazy amount like there and there it's
because they're ever it's everywhere every
[SPEAKER_03]: gas station you could go to and unite it
seems like in the whole country has some
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of fake conscious substitute so I
mean they might just legalize nature they
[SPEAKER_03]: just need to go back it's the only way
things are gonna anything's gonna happen
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like there it's just getting weirder
and weirder the more they do these stupid
[SPEAKER_03]: things and it's gonna get so absurd and
dangerous and dumb it's just like just
[SPEAKER_03]: just legalize the thing it was it's part
of everybody's life before Harry Anslinger
[SPEAKER_01]: got involved yeah totally I mean hey on on
that topic I know that you know cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't isn't the only ethnobotanical plant
in your life and a lot of people wanted me
[SPEAKER_01]: to ask you you know what's what's been
going on in Bodie's garden I know you've
[SPEAKER_01]: just moved are you have you got any cactus
with you growing anything else oh yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been well the cool thing is not
having a canvas garden I get to do all the
[SPEAKER_03]: other so I got yeah I got super into
cactus like I love doing cactus seeds but
[SPEAKER_03]: it's such a it's such a waiting game but
it's so fun it's like you know it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't check every day because it's
like oh what's happening but yeah that
[SPEAKER_03]: cactus is amazing you know especially the
spirit nourishing ones super into cactus
[SPEAKER_03]: and I love popping and cutting and doing
every just getting into it and trading and
[SPEAKER_03]: getting things and now you know it's kind
of a it can you know it takes up a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: space I love mushrooms I got to do a
little more foray into mushrooms when I
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't have a garden to root you know
that's kind of like one of my first loves
[SPEAKER_03]: you know and I have all the other plants
that I that I enjoy you know I used to
[SPEAKER_03]: collect salvia strains I'll be a divanor
before it became schedule I have the chaat
[SPEAKER_03]: that I grow that I love from Ethiopia and
Yemen so many amazing spirit plants and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're so they're so you know they do
such a amazing things the key to that is
[SPEAKER_03]: just really respecting them you know and
really giving them you know they're
[SPEAKER_03]: powerful powerful tools and powerful
allies and to really go into that space
[SPEAKER_03]: you know and connect with them with your
heart so they know that you're in there to
[SPEAKER_03]: learn and love and live and and get the
teachings that they want to give you yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: totally I'm so glad to hear that you
you've been able to continue with some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the videos I guess for a lot of people you
know growing a cactus is you know I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: actually know but like you know I've grown
cactuses it's really fun it didn't seem
[SPEAKER_01]: like a big deal but I haven't really
ventured out into something like salvia
[SPEAKER_01]: which you know I've had salvia I think
it's cool what would you say is you know
[SPEAKER_01]: besides cactus for example what's one that
someone should give a go that's like
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty user-friendly it's you know easy
enough to do well another one the cat out
[SPEAKER_03]: of the bag everybody you know everybody
should be growing mushrooms you know
[SPEAKER_03]: culinary first you know whatever mataki's
shiitake's oysters the oysters you can go
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty much anything you literally grow
them in your in your hair you know if you
[SPEAKER_03]: just kept a spray bottle spritz bottle by
on your work belt grow mushrooms everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: should grow mushrooms they're so amazing
and especially grow the psychedelic one
[SPEAKER_03]: and then it's so easy and so many it's so
you know there's especially the United
[SPEAKER_03]: States now we have all these places like
Santa Cruz Oakland Denver where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: totally cool to to explore that and it's
such a fascinating world that you know
[SPEAKER_03]: people don't realize I mean people do now
but the mushroom the mushroom community is
[SPEAKER_03]: huge they have forums they have so much
stuff and it's so the breedings are just
[SPEAKER_03]: people are really starting to get into
breeding it's very driven by by mutants
[SPEAKER_03]: like everybody's looking for the newest
mutants looking for like nutistic ones and
[SPEAKER_03]: albinos and there's so many cool new
expressions and people breeding them in
[SPEAKER_03]: this way in that way and getting these new
effects and colors and ones that look like
[SPEAKER_03]: you know you've seen like enigma have you
ever seen some of the new like mushrooms
[SPEAKER_03]: that look like literally like a loaf of
swiss cheese or look like little
[SPEAKER_03]: spaceships or and they're so you know
they're so rich in indoles and in you know
[SPEAKER_03]: in spirit molecules like it's incredible I
you know everybody everybody should grow
[SPEAKER_03]: mushrooms I think that's yeah just get get
yourself go on YouTube get some spores and
[SPEAKER_03]: do whatever we can but experience that
like I think that's a really powerful way
[SPEAKER_03]: to re-initiate yourself on this planet as
a person for change and growth and for to
[SPEAKER_03]: make this planet a better place you know
get your spores going totally this is this
[SPEAKER_01]: is a call to action I'm obliged to follow
I'm gonna give it a go you know what
[SPEAKER_01]: you've inspired me because you're right
it's not that hard and I should I should
[SPEAKER_01]: give it a go so that's cool the other one
I wanted to ask you about this is more of
[SPEAKER_01]: I know other people are interested but me
personally I'm very invested have you had
[SPEAKER_01]: much chance to to do any thinking or doing
in the the olfactory DJing adventure of
[SPEAKER_01]: yours you know I've still got a few of
your perfumes left they're my special
[SPEAKER_01]: occasion perfumes and I'm sadly out of the
the the black rose but and I'm very low on
[SPEAKER_01]: the Kyoto but that's you know that's the
very special occasions yeah definitely I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: so ready to get back into that like I I've
made a bunch before I moved just knowing
[SPEAKER_03]: that they ate you know it's all about
aging with the some of those and yeah I
[SPEAKER_03]: love essential oils and I love plant
compounds and that in this in the or and
[SPEAKER_03]: making the oils and blending is kind of
like a combination of music and breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: and each you know biochemical spells and
alchemy like it's it's such a rewarding
[SPEAKER_03]: and special thing that you can do you know
because set is all memory there's more
[SPEAKER_03]: neurons and in our nasal there's more
nasal neurons there is a site like we use
[SPEAKER_03]: it so much more it's like it's it's the
you know even with our rig it's up touch
[SPEAKER_03]: taste well not taste but smell and vision
and hearing is all vibrational you know
[SPEAKER_03]: smell is like it is is it is a song it's a
tapestry it's like the language of
[SPEAKER_03]: creation on a botanical level like you
know there's I heard that guy from what
[SPEAKER_03]: the abstracts tech the tripping I see
there's 400,000 terpenes now I don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: if that's correct I thought there was only
like 20,000 he said 400,000 there's only
[SPEAKER_03]: 200,000 words in the English language like
that's like double the language potential
[SPEAKER_03]: of Korea of a botanical expression like
these are the every plant that grows like
[SPEAKER_03]: sings its own biochemical song and like
every year that those are distilled it's
[SPEAKER_03]: different because of different weather
patterns different soil different people
[SPEAKER_03]: that cultivated the plants like it's just
this I don't know I think a well-prepared
[SPEAKER_03]: perfume or a tar or galia or whatever you
want to call it is like a symphony of life
[SPEAKER_03]: that's enclosed in time and space like
it's an interactive I don't know it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: a I can't explain so yes to answer that
I'm super jive I have about 12 ones that
[SPEAKER_03]: have been aging and I want to get back
into it I mean it's just you know how I
[SPEAKER_03]: got into ouds really hardcore and that
just that is not a good hobby for someone
[SPEAKER_03]: on a budget let me tell you so I stopped
buying ouds even though I love oud I think
[SPEAKER_03]: oud is like the grand wizard terpene
experience like if you really think you're
[SPEAKER_03]: like the terp wizard like moving into ouds
and really experiencing ouds for all that
[SPEAKER_03]: nature can create smell-wise as like as
things volatilize and evaporate off and
[SPEAKER_03]: smell that smell journey like that ouds
are one of like that's a you know people
[SPEAKER_03]: want a tip on really if they enjoy scent
and to enjoy smelling to get into maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: like not not age not more like a new farm
dude it's not like the the older wild
[SPEAKER_03]: dudes which can be too expensive to
initiate but yes to the landscape of
[SPEAKER_03]: desire all the smells will be coming out
as soon as I can get enough time to kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of put them on an Etsy store or make a
thing but yeah I love scent and I love
[SPEAKER_01]: working with this with essential worlds
I'm excited and I know others are too I
[SPEAKER_01]: think a fair few of our patreon members
actually have messaged me and they've told
[SPEAKER_01]: me you know I got hive as well so that's
that's uh that's cool to hear that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: some more on the horizon and there's a
quick little thank you I don't know if you
[SPEAKER_01]: can see I've still got this bit of
eaglewood you gave me years ago and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: my go-to I have it right here ready to go
because I I hit it with this little
[SPEAKER_01]: blowtorch and I love it you know like I've
obviously gotten into oud on your
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendation but even just you know
something like pal santo or you know
[SPEAKER_01]: eaglewood like people will love it give it
a go guys dive in headfirst and and while
[SPEAKER_01]: we're on that train of thought you know we
were sort of talking about it earlier but
[SPEAKER_01]: just for for more specifics like we had a
few people who were like hey I've gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: into meditation and more sort of spiritual
stuff and just increase awareness while
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the garden and I want to I want to
know from Bodhi like what's a strain that
[SPEAKER_01]: he feels complements that you know that
maybe is good for meditation or yoga or
[SPEAKER_01]: you know in the garden what's something
you like um you know it's hard because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's so individual it's kind of finding
it's kind of fine you know there's like
[SPEAKER_03]: it's finding that strain that works for
you to to be mindful you know because it
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis kind of enlivens the mind and you
know in meditation you're trying to kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of tame the mind or at least not attached
to all the all the chatter that's going on
[SPEAKER_03]: so I'm trying to think of what it's funny
because all the Baba smoke and they
[SPEAKER_03]: meditate I I've had really good
experiences smoking and meditating and
[SPEAKER_03]: then I've had times where I'm like oh I
shouldn't have smoked like it's just not
[SPEAKER_03]: happening but let me think I mean like
that's a hard one it's I think it just it
[SPEAKER_03]: goes back down to just try a lot of
strains and you know ride your bike on
[SPEAKER_03]: them hike on them you'll go do with your
stuff with your kids play sudoku meditate
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of map those strains in your life
that that help you in those instances and
[SPEAKER_03]: then another thing it's like people with
medical conditions um map those strains
[SPEAKER_03]: that really help you with your medical
conditions so you can share them you know
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't always work for everybody but
there are tend to be strains that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: work better for certain conditions you
know like the sunshine daydream of mine
[SPEAKER_03]: always people always tend to say that it
works really good for neurological
[SPEAKER_03]: conditions and pain um you know and
there's strains that work for people that
[SPEAKER_03]: have colitis it's like I it's hard for me
to tell you what it's going to be good for
[SPEAKER_03]: meditation but if you want to maybe do
something historical and more of a
[SPEAKER_03]: heritage base do you know maybe uh look to
some uh hash or hand rubbed or stuff from
[SPEAKER_03]: the himalayas or india places where
they've traditionally smoked and meditated
[SPEAKER_01]: at the same time that's fantastically
practical advice I love that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely you know india it's uh it makes
perfect sense of course the stuff there
[SPEAKER_01]: and nearby would complement that sort of
thing
