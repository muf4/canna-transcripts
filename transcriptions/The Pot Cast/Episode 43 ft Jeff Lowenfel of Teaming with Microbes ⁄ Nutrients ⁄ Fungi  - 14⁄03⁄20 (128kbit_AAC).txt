[SPEAKER_00]: holding down the fort down under.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty, so a massive welcome to a man
who simply needs no introduction,
[SPEAKER_00]: a friend of mine and the author of what
many consider to be the organic gardener's
[SPEAKER_00]: Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the man who reminded the world the
importance of mycorrhizal fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff Lowenfeld.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, you know, I got my brand new hat
on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, maybe I could take it off for
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really kind of bald.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: What fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this is an amazing technology we
have.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can meet from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's just an amazing
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it makes sense when you think about
it, because microbes are ubiquitous,
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all over the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can talk about Alaskan microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can talk about Australian microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, we're talking about the same
thing, which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The connections are there far and wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first question we like to ask our
guests, what have you been smoking on
[SPEAKER_00]: recently?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's see, a little citrus sap
someone gave me just a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you go around and give
advice to people about what to grow and
[SPEAKER_03]: how to grow things and whatnot,
sometimes they give you a little gift here
[SPEAKER_03]: and there, which is kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really, I've really been smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: I vaporize flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really had a combustion
situation with a joint in about four or
[SPEAKER_03]: five years because I find it to be much
more enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's probably a lot healthier if
you don't carbonize the flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in any case, I've been doing this,
you know, now that my parents are gone,
[SPEAKER_03]: I can say it a long, long, long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's finally gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've gotten to the point where the stigma
is gone, where the quality has improved,
[SPEAKER_03]: where we're not smoking or vaporizing
sticks and sticks and seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, the effort to legalize all
around the world has just been absolutely
[SPEAKER_03]: phenomenal, as you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a new world we're living in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there are a couple of rules we all
need to follow, and some of them we are
[SPEAKER_03]: and some of them we aren't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we'll get there, but we've got
to prevent governments from looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis as the gateway to taxation that
it has become in the United States and
[SPEAKER_03]: start treating this plant more like a
tomato plant than something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a plant that's easy to grow,
that everybody can grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not treat this thing like it's a
fourth branch of government.
[SPEAKER_03]: For goodness sakes, you know, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm off my stool.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've definitely got some stuff up that
alley I want to jump into.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's just quickly rewind for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was actually in college in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, and my brother
[SPEAKER_03]: came over to me freshman year.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a law student about to graduate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his girlfriend, he said, had just
tried to commit suicide.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he made me promise I would never,
ever smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we called it marijuana back
then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I went a year while he was off in
Europe getting a Fulbright scholarship.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when he came back, I was helping him
unpack.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first thing out of a suitcase was
a gigantic, beautiful inlaid hash pipe
[SPEAKER_03]: that he picked up in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, What's this?
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, Oh, you can buy a can of hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: For five dollars in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went, What?
[SPEAKER_03]: You made me not smoke marijuana for a
year?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went back to college.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my great friends and I,
we just got stoned and I haven't looked
[SPEAKER_03]: back since.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's fast forward a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When was it that you grew your first
plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably first got stoned about 1960.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably about 1975.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in law school at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of my law professors had a bunch
of plants that had mealybugs on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she knew I was a gardener.
[SPEAKER_03]: She said, Can you do anything with them?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give them to me and I'll try.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the alcohol took care of both me and
the mealybugs on the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was it ultimately that kind of
stimulated you to write Teaming with
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've always been a gardener.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been, in fact, they tell me I am
the longest running garden columnist in
[SPEAKER_03]: the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been writing a garden column in
Anchorage, Alaska since 1976.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never miss a single week because they
put your picture in the paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they say he's not there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll be back in a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me, that always said rob his house.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I always have a column.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wasn't writing for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was writing for people in Anchorage,
Alaska, a place not unlike, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would imagine Perth, where most of the
people are new.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've never gardened there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know what can grow there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The climate is different there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was sort of the advisor is to
here's what you can grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once a week, I wrote a column.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every now and then I would write a
column about tomatoes and tell people
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you know, wink, wink.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is about tomatoes, but it might be
about canvas as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was a chemical head.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a chemical head for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: My family had a intricate relationship
with the founder of Miracle Grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: He used to work for my father and my
grandfather.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we were always big into Miracle
Grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't until probably about 1990.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my friends sent me a picture of a
nematode being strangled by a fungal
[SPEAKER_03]: hyphae.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was trying to protect the root.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the first book team with microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I saw that and I said, oh,
and I figured out that maybe being organic
[SPEAKER_03]: meant something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe these microbes, which we were
always trying to get rid of made a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I ended up finding Dr. Elaine
Ingham, who is the guru of all things,
[SPEAKER_03]: soil food web, as far as I'm concerned,
and became quite the disciple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just put it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's impacted my life ever since.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really been quite something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to clarify, when you were growing
your first plants, were you using
[SPEAKER_00]: something like Miracle Grow or was it in?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was using Miracle Grow up until I
wrote the book, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the book came out in 2006.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really started writing the book in about
1998 or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to write it a couple of times
because the first time I wrote it,
[SPEAKER_03]: I wrote it as a comic book.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the publisher looked at it and said,
you know, this may make sense,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we don't dumb books down.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make them smarter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you rewrite this book in more
scientific terms, we'll publish it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And anyway, so it wasn't it wasn't until
about 1998 or 99 that I realized that the
[SPEAKER_03]: Miracle Grow system, the system of using
chemicals was not the right way to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't matter whether it was cannabis,
a tomato, whether it was a flower,
[SPEAKER_03]: vegetable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Using chemicals does not make sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, this was long before,
you know, we had Greta and other people
[SPEAKER_03]: telling us, yeah, it doesn't make sense
for other reasons on top of what you
[SPEAKER_03]: think.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it was quite something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was quite a turnaround.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to basically admit to my readers
that I'd been giving them bad advice for
[SPEAKER_03]: 25 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember the newspaper ran a series
of ads, which you could find in the
[SPEAKER_03]: newspaper boxes and just had my bat in my
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it said, you know, two weeks,
Jeff Lohenfeld is going to turn his back
[SPEAKER_03]: on 25 years of advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did thinking that all of my readers
would abandon me immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I discovered was there's an
incredible thirst for organics that people
[SPEAKER_03]: want to be organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to use chemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's only because they get forced into
it that they end up, I think, succumbing
[SPEAKER_03]: to what we call a new way of gardening,
which is actually, you know, a
[SPEAKER_03]: destructive, terrible, terrible way of
ruining, ruining soil and ruining the life
[SPEAKER_03]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So long long answer for a quick question.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're our favorite type of answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to ask you, you know,
a favorite kind of topic amongst all
[SPEAKER_00]: organic growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember your first organic
harvest?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I do, because the taste was
completely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can taste those chemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's my head, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the taste is different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, now we know that it's not
just you're not just doing this for the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant, you're doing this for the worker,
if that may be yourself, and you're doing
[SPEAKER_03]: it for the environment as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's become become much more important
than just simply growing a plant that
[SPEAKER_03]: tasted clean and pure and and that you
knew did not contain any of these things
[SPEAKER_03]: that probably are not that good for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I remember and and I think that
most people do and I think when most
[SPEAKER_03]: people go into a supermarket, if the price
was the same on food, they would buy the
[SPEAKER_03]: organic over the non organic period.
[SPEAKER_03]: The organization that I belong to of
garden writers, it's a big national US
[SPEAKER_03]: organization.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there's a counterpart in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is not one of us not one of us
that isn't organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody willingly writes an article or does
a television show or a podcast that says,
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, here's what you need to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go out to your nearest hardware store and
find that smelly section and buy that
[SPEAKER_03]: crappy crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's chemical and mix it in, you know,
now the nearest we get to that,
[SPEAKER_03]: from my perspective, and you're going to
get a lot of mail over this one is
[SPEAKER_03]: hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, I don't think
hydroponics is the same thing as soil
[SPEAKER_03]: either.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's certainly a lot better than the
pesticide herbicide chemical situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I, I like the idea of good living
soil, period.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% I can get down with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was the initial response from the
cannabis community in regards to the book?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it take off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did it take a little bit of time before
the wheels started to turn?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I wasn't really paying attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the book came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was inundated with or it was,
frankly, the subject matter, not the
[SPEAKER_03]: writing, but the book got great reviews.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, most important book written in
the past 25 years and maybe ever holding,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I mean, like, you know,
really, you know, I mean, and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, horticulture, all these
magazines and things picked it up and big
[SPEAKER_03]: and it became quite the topic for what I
call the garden club circuit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I run around the country and Canada
and I gave lectures on how to use microbes
[SPEAKER_03]: to grow your vegetables and everything
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wasn't paying attention to the
cannabis market, frankly, because it was
[SPEAKER_03]: underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and it wasn't as organized as it has
become.
[SPEAKER_03]: It became evident, oh, probably around
2010, 2012, when Colorado started to
[SPEAKER_03]: legalize here in the United States,
it became evident that this book was being
[SPEAKER_03]: read by people who grew cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: One time I was sitting on an airplane
going to a conference and somebody came up
[SPEAKER_03]: to me and said, Hey, I read your book
grows the best weed ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was floored, first of all,
that the person recognized me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Second, that the person read the book,
but third, that, you know, they were using
[SPEAKER_03]: it to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, of course, I think my publisher
has come to realize that the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: market is quite large, and they read a lot
of books in cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's become a Bible and then and then
the other two books that go with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a I call it a trilogy series teaming
with microbes was the first one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really wrote it for Dr. Elaine
Ingham.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't write it for myself or anything
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, she asked me, you know,
what could I do to help her?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, I can write you a book.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I wrote the book teaming with
nutrients I wrote for myself because I was
[SPEAKER_03]: sitting in a restaurant with my wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking at a picture of a bunch of
women eating spaghetti.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said to myself, you know,
you're you may be America's longest
[SPEAKER_03]: running garden columnist, but you don't
have any idea how plants eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how plants get their food,
because that's what that first book told
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how plants get the food.
[SPEAKER_03]: But how do they take it in?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what do they do with it once it gets
into their cells?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was teaming with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was to me, sort of a metaphysical
trippy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy crow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the numbers of cells in a single
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens in each individual cell?
[SPEAKER_03]: The number there are 10,000 individual
kinds of enzymes in each individual cell
[SPEAKER_03]: in a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are 10,000 of each one, maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there are gazillions of you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so all of a sudden, not only did I
understand how a plant starts to work and
[SPEAKER_03]: how it gets put to, you know, how it
works, how it eats, how it takes the food
[SPEAKER_03]: in.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I started to realize,
wait a minute, enzymes, enzymes are
[SPEAKER_03]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you know, maybe we need this and
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of a sudden you can start to think
like a cannabis plant or any other kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know how to take care of it better
when you realize that these enzymes that I
[SPEAKER_03]: just talked about work best at 74 to 76
degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe now I know what the right
temperature is to grow everything,
[SPEAKER_03]: not just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so, yeah, it was a fascinating ride.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then and then after that, I was asked
to revise teaming with microbes because
[SPEAKER_03]: mycorrhizal fungi were coming onto the
scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: My routine with microbes, there were a
paragraph on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we couldn't grow them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They couldn't be duplicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: People thought they were ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you've got them in Australia,
I got them in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_03]: So but but that turned out not to be true.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I revised teaming with microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: While I was doing that, it became very
evident to me that over the next four or
[SPEAKER_03]: five years, there was research going on
that was going to result in a need for a
[SPEAKER_03]: special book on just these particular
fungi in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was teaming with microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just about mycorrhizal fungi,
it's about fungi in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: But oh, my goodness gracious, when you
take a look, for example, at the fires in
[SPEAKER_03]: Australia, if those mycorrhizal fungi
live, you're going to get trees coming
[SPEAKER_03]: back.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they don't live, forget it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those trees are not coming back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have prairie land.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's kind of an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're able to grow them,
we're able to duplicate them, and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: able to use them in growing specific
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we know which one is the one that
feeds cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you use it, your cannabis plant is
like no other cannabis plant you've ever
[SPEAKER_03]: seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, so that's the trilogy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a lot of fun, but they all start
with the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what a really comprehensive overview
of them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the obvious kind of follow up
question is your more recent book,
[SPEAKER_00]: DIY auto flowering cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it that stimulated to do this
one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was influenced by the in on the first
book by a friend of mine, Tom Alexander.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a very early cannabis grower during
the illegal days.
[SPEAKER_03]: He helped coin the term Sansemilla back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's the guy that that sent me the
picture of the of the nematode being
[SPEAKER_03]: strangled by the fungus.
[SPEAKER_03]: He and I are very, very good friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: One day I was at his place in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he showed me these these tomato sized
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said these are called auto
flowering cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're really kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, look at these cute little
flowers, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I decided to try to grow them and and
they were fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing spectacular.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I live in Anchorage, Alaska,
and in Anchorage, Alaska, you don't get
[SPEAKER_03]: days that are shorter than nights until
September 21st.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about the day of your first frost.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not going to get flowering
cannabis in Anchorage, Alaska,
[SPEAKER_03]: unless you have a light deprivation
situation, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these auto flowers don't have a photo
period.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go from seed to flower based on
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you end up with a flowering plant
that's harvested after seven to nine
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm thinking again, I'm thinking like
Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, in Australia, in the capital
territory, I guess it's now legal to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: If people aren't growing auto flowering
cannabis there, they're making the biggest
[SPEAKER_03]: mistake Australians have ever made.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're making the biggest mistakes since
bringing in the toads.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's I can say that
because these things grow from seven to
[SPEAKER_03]: nine weeks to harvest seed to harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means you're limited to six plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they think they think you're going
to get one or two harvest a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't realize with your auto flowers,
you're going to get, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: so many more.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it turns out that these plants are now
better than indica and sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once that happened, I decided it was
time to put my reputation on the line and
[SPEAKER_03]: and sort of help the auto flower industry
get get going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they are so much better than
regular indica sativas with which they're
[SPEAKER_03]: bred.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me list let me list the things I
like about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and I should preface this by saying
the book is called DIY auto flowering
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not a book for the professional
grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a book for the professional
growers mother or brother or aunt or
[SPEAKER_03]: uncle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes from soup to nuts on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it centers around this idea that we
now have a plant that doesn't have an auto
[SPEAKER_03]: period that goes from seed to flower based
on genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, if you fertilize them the good
soil, they won't do well because their
[SPEAKER_03]: soils too rich.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are small tomato sized plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet today, not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Four years ago, but today, the yield on
them per acre is better than the yield in
[SPEAKER_03]: sativa indica yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm predicting right here on your show
that in the next five years, nobody will
[SPEAKER_03]: be growing except occasionally,
the bigger plants, everybody will be
[SPEAKER_03]: growing auto flowering cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wanted the world to know about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe this is a plant you're going to
be able to get at your local nursery every
[SPEAKER_03]: spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe this is a plant you're going to
be able to buy seeds from the seed rack.
[SPEAKER_03]: You grow it at home in a five gallon
bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: You reuse the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to spray it with anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It grows so fast that it grows through
cycles where it would have problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, if there's a bug that wants
that plant, by the time the bug gets
[SPEAKER_03]: settled in, the plants already grown
through the next stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my goodness gracious.
[SPEAKER_03]: They flower after two weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, this is a terrific,
terrific new plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt it needed a book.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, again, not a book for the
professional.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not what I call a cannabis porn.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have so many cannabis porn books,
you know, beautiful buds and beautiful
[SPEAKER_03]: colors and sizes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, but, you know, this is a
how to for your mother.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's legal where she's growing,
you should buy her this book, get it on
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazon, just like the other ones and get
her some seeds and get her into this plant
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's a fun, fun plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Auto flowers, you know, it's fun to grow a
sativa, an indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a hundred times more fun to grow an
auto flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: They grow right before your eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indoors and outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically answered the most of the
next question I was going to ask,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was, did you kind of like,
you know, without necessarily thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about it, right, this is something which
would kind of get the older generations
[SPEAKER_00]: who might be a little more skeptical and
just kind of bridge that gap for and make
[SPEAKER_00]: it that little bit easier for them to get
into it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of my thinking was this is a book for
my mother, even though she's no longer
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is the kind of book my mother,
she was a gardener.
[SPEAKER_03]: She loved to grow things and she'd try
anything new.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last time something new came to
America, it was the snap pea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've got them down where
you are, but the snap pea came and
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody went nuts for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody went nuts for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, nobody had to write a book about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, cannabis has had such a bad
rap that I think the book needed to be
[SPEAKER_03]: written because it deals with the stigma.
[SPEAKER_03]: It deals with why it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It deals with all the silliness.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it also introduces people to the
notion of strains and land races and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, all of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, one of the pictures I've got in
there is a strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: They call it here in the United States,
the Australian bastard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a spectacular looking little
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got millions of little leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people are breeding it right now with
auto flowers, developing some very
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting plants from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just a it's fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I think this is the next
tomato.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't I don't know if where you are
tomatoes are a big hobby plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But but here in the United States,
they're the you know, they're the holy
[SPEAKER_03]: grail of gardening, you know, to get a
fresh tomato and to give it to your
[SPEAKER_03]: neighbor, you know, you know, is like
wearing the sheriff's badge in town.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm a gardener.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so so you know, this is this is I
think the next tomato plant is a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: fun to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And frankly, I would say here here in the
States, oh, maybe a quarter of the
[SPEAKER_03]: growers, commercial growers are now using
these.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've they're replacing the bigger guys
because the yields are bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard for people to believe that
particularly people who've used auto
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the same genetics that used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe a slightly redundant question
that you could maybe infer your answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are you kind of on board with the no
till movement?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: The no till movement is a part of soil
food webby thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you till your soil and I'll relate this
to cannabis in a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you till your soil, first of all,
you're breaking up that wonderful
[SPEAKER_03]: mycorrhizal fungi, which is described in
teaming with fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're you're when you cut a worm in half,
you don't get two worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get half a dead worm, you know,
two halves of dead worm.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you unless you hit it at the 18th
segment, in which case one half might
[SPEAKER_03]: live.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you have bacteria that are up here,
you rototill, you put them down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're supposed to be up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actinomycetes are supposed to be deeper in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, rototill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something is a very, very bad thing to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you grow cannabis, I would go one
step further.
[SPEAKER_03]: I reuse my soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm regenerative.
[SPEAKER_03]: I reuse the roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: I leave the I cut the stem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I plant right in the pot without pulling
the plant out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how much no till I believe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those roots have been putting out exudates
into that soil, attracting and feeding the
[SPEAKER_03]: right kind of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Microbes, those roots provide pathways for
new roots to travel down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by not breaking it up, of course,
you've left the mycorrhizal fungi that are
[SPEAKER_03]: there in place with spores so that the
plant becomes infected as it grows into
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, no till.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really big on no till.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and I love to till.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so much fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of it's one of gardening's joy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet it's the worst thing you can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not rototill.
[SPEAKER_03]: After you garden the first time,
fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: After that, never again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, why do people rototill?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is a this is an interesting
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it applies to places like like Alaska
and the United States during the colonial
[SPEAKER_03]: period, Australia, New Zealand,
places that were being settled.
[SPEAKER_03]: During the early 1800s, late 1700s,
an English guy codified what everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was that plants ate soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called the humus theory of growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if plants ate soil, this guy said,
hmm, let's just pulverize it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We pulverize it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be easier for him to eat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he invented rototilling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, in the United States, in Australia,
in New Zealand, in in places where there
[SPEAKER_03]: was old growth forest and settlers came,
they didn't want to grow old growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted to grow vegetables to eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they cut the old growth down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And old growth forests are supported by
soils that are very heavy in fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vegetables like cannabis are supported by
bacteria based soils, some fungi,
[SPEAKER_03]: but mostly bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you rototill, you convert old
growth soil into bacteria soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once you do it, you've got bacteria
soil, you don't have to do it again and
[SPEAKER_03]: again and again and again and again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're losing soil all around the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a result, it's a bad, bad, bad thing to
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you should you reuse the soil in your
pots at a minimum, just you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: compost it and then reuse it after three
months.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can grow three, four times in the
same pot without without changing it at
[SPEAKER_03]: all.
[SPEAKER_03]: You feed the soil with compost and compost
teas, but but you don't rototill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's your thoughts on some of the new
quote organic companies we see coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of have these long lasting
granular solutions you put in the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: water over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, have you come across these and
what's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it depends on what they're using.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, perlite is getting a bad
rap these days because it doesn't go away.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are using a lot more coco coir,
which is a good recyclable product that
[SPEAKER_03]: can that's porous.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the the companies I worry about
are the ones that use the word organic
[SPEAKER_03]: without any certification.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't trust those companies at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And organic is a word that people kick
around and regenerative as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to have country standards and they
got to be followed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you know you're getting something
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of new products that
people are bringing on board.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are GMO products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are made by GMO products.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, they're not GMO
themselves, but they're made by GMO
[SPEAKER_03]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got to be very careful about what
you're using.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty pure about about the term
organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty old fashioned about it as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, they never had that as a kid when I
was a kid is organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, so there's there's new things
coming into the organic field that are
[SPEAKER_03]: certainly worth following.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of IPM kind of stuff,
you know, coming in as well and
[SPEAKER_03]: fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the great stuff is happening,
so very excited about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cannabis field is the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that leads it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Used to be the viniculture's not the not
the farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, but now I think it's the
cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really some of the best gardeners I've
ever ever worked with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do advising all over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a team of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it doesn't matter whether you're
in Colombia, Mexico, Alaska, Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Kansas doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're growing cannabis, there's a way
to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the right way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're open to it, wow,
really is something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: The results are incredible, absolutely
incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's been the best thing about all of
this stuff is that people come up to me
[SPEAKER_03]: and they and they tell me that they've
converted and that they've never looked
[SPEAKER_03]: back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go, yes, because I don't make any money
off of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you my publisher might make
some.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it's when somebody writes a
letter or you call up and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, let's do a podcast or,
you know, you give me a nice introduction
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's, that's what this is all
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we we've screwed things up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, you know, 70 years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now my my goddess is Greta.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've got to make sure that she
gets the garden and her kids get the
[SPEAKER_03]: garden period.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't matter whether it's
cannabis or tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we if we don't do it organically,
you know, then I kind of make it period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Simple as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sentiment I can get behind again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the theme, the theme of my
side of the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a question I'm sure a ton of fans want
to know, would you be able to give us a
[SPEAKER_00]: little basic, excuse me, would you be able
to give us a little basic rundown of your
[SPEAKER_00]: growing setup?
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that, I just mean, what type of
amendments do you like to use when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing your soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, do you have, you know,
just little things you like to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first of all, I travel an awful lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one of the nice things about the
auto flowers is that I can come back and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do a lot of do a lot of tent growing
in the winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got a nice line tent that I've
made myself using electrical poles,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that I've rigged together using
the little circuit socket things,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they fit in anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got a tent that grows about four
to six plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I outdoors, I live on I live on
eight acres and I, I garden on about three
[SPEAKER_03]: or two or three of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a small outdoor greenhouse and an
indoor greenhouse as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mix I use is is based with something
called Alaska humus.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a very rich, natural soil from
Alaska.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Anchorage, we have earthquakes all the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this soil has to be removed 80 feet of
it and put in the landfills where it's no
[SPEAKER_03]: longer available before you can build the
giant cabbages that people associate with
[SPEAKER_03]: Alaska.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are grown in this stuff in a in an
area outside of Anchorage where it's it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, got a little six inch layer
right down in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very, very rich, rich,
microbiological soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, Dr. Elaine once said it has the
highest microbiology of any soil she's
[SPEAKER_03]: ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I basically plant in that with I'll
put in some cocoa in it, just for just for
[SPEAKER_03]: good drainage.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put a little green sand in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put a little bit of fish,
fish hydrolyzite in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's basically it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now for most people, good compost is a
good starter, because if you're using
[SPEAKER_03]: Alaska humus, it provides the indigenous
microbes from your own area.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are microbes that are going to live
in your area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the fact that I'm using Alaska humus,
and basically what Alaska humus is,
[SPEAKER_03]: is compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just happens to be from from out in the
wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every summer it thaws.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every winter it freezes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Been going on for 10,000 years and it's
just beautiful, beautiful black.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's streptomycin.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a streptomycin cell smell that's in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, you've got it all over all around
the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you don't, you make compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that compost you make on the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't make it in a machine, because you
want indigenous microbes come up from the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil in the ground and get into your
compost pile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you make vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you put in indigenous soil into the
vermicompost bin if you use a bin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vermicompost is terrific because it's got
concentrated nutrients in it that compost
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't have.
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be the base for everybody's,
everybody's grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now if you've got a big gigantic farm,
that's hard to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you just have to constantly make
compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to constantly amend.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to constantly feed and take
care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's important that once you get your
soil, you keep it alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use compost teas and compost extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: A compost extract is nothing more than
taking compost, putting it into a
[SPEAKER_03]: cheesecloth setup, and just squeezing it
in warm water for 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You end up squeezing out the microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't multiply them, but you extract
them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you feed them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always have a layer of compost down on
the base of my plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not on the base, but at the base of my
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once every year, every five or six
grows, I will actually dig in,
[SPEAKER_03]: depending on what the tests show that it
needs, what it needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use a living mulch, usually a sweet
clover mulch, which is easy to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I test with something that most people
have never heard of called a
[SPEAKER_03]: microbiometer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I advise this company because once I saw
this thing, I went crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always looked for something that I
could say to people, your product teams
[SPEAKER_03]: with microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy my seal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you an endorsement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how do you show that something teams
with microbes?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can look it under a microscope and
everything else, but that really doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: tell you anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: What this does, this tells you the changes
in biomass in your soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Biomass is basically the microbes in your
soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to do a biomass test for most soil
tests, it's $500.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes a month, maybe three weeks if
you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a test that this woman has
developed that you use your iPhone or your
[SPEAKER_03]: Android, doesn't matter which.
[SPEAKER_03]: You use a phone, you take a sample,
you mix it out in the field in about seven
[SPEAKER_03]: to 10 minutes, and then you do a reading
right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It costs you five bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it tells you what the biomass is of
your soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you're putting a good organic
fertilizer on your plant, the biomass
[SPEAKER_03]: increases because the microbes go out and
eat it up and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can tell what's happening to your
plant by looking at the microbiometer
[SPEAKER_03]: test.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're a grower, you can tell when
the plant begins to flower, the exudates
[SPEAKER_03]: slowly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They start to flower down and you get a
lower biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a fascinating new tool that's
being tested here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's being sold in Australia, actually,
and you can get it on the web.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go look at the www.microbiometer.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fascinating new tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, if I do a test and I have a
test that's over about five or 600,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't do anything to my soil,
nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just take the Alaska humus,
put a little coir in it for drainage,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Simple as that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a very interesting new tool that I
think is going to help people test their
[SPEAKER_03]: soil and know what to do with it,
particularly when they're growing
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, because let's face it,
it's not that hard a plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a plant you can screw up easily,
but it's not that hard to grow if you do
[SPEAKER_03]: it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've actually bought some of those
tests myself and I can definitely vouch
[SPEAKER_00]: for what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aren't they?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the difference, for example,
I use it in Alaska in the spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tells me when spring hits.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see an increase in the biomass when the
trees start to drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: The exudates start to increase.
[SPEAKER_03]: That tells me it's time to tell my
readers, you're about to be outdoors soon
[SPEAKER_03]: because the trees never lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great new tool and great things are
happening and my understanding is it's
[SPEAKER_03]: even being improved.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I knew who the distributors were in
Australia, but anyway, it's a great new
[SPEAKER_03]: tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to loop back quickly to a
topic we were talking about earlier when
[SPEAKER_00]: you mentioned that you're fond of products
that have the organic certification and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any that you basically recommend
to steer clear of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in the past, and particularly in
the cannabis industry, some of our guests,
[SPEAKER_00]: including myself, have been quite scared
and skeptical of the OMRI registration,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, yeah, a bit sinister.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think there are some that aren't as
good as others?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't think OMRI is sinister.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't think it's as comprehensive
as it could be.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a company that uses the word
organic all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would never touch their lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would never touch their fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would never touch their soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would never listen to the nasty Scots
guy that yells at me and tells me to put
[SPEAKER_03]: the stuff on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: so you got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: OMRI is very simple to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the problem with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't give it to just anybody,
but it's too simple to get to be very,
[SPEAKER_03]: very comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very often it makes sense to actually,
now that we've got the web, go on the web
[SPEAKER_03]: and contact the companies and ask for the,
they call them manufacturer product sheets
[SPEAKER_03]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And tests, and a lot of these companies
have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's what you really need to
look for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find one that's good then and stick with
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I also like, I like to go into
nurseries and to grow stores and find out
[SPEAKER_03]: what are people really getting good
results from?
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes sense?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys like?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I look at it and I smell it and I try
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's fascinating how many new things
there are out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the big guys are getting in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I won't mention the name of that
particular one, but I will mention Bayer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they're doing now is they're
trying to figure out how to modify a plant
[SPEAKER_03]: so that it will produce its own nitrogen,
which is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure how they're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to make plants give off the
signal that attracts mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: The things that they're doing,
part of me says, gee, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe it's going to be good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the way they go about it may be not
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got to, we just got to keep our
eyes open.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have to talk to each other about
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I love giving talks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love going to conventions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have them here in the United States all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my goodness gracious, you know,
every any place that legalizes cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: ends up with a good conference every other
month.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are lots of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's very interesting to see who
thrives, who doesn't, who people frequent
[SPEAKER_03]: and who they don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bad guys are getting known out there
pretty, pretty well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that actually perfectly segues into
the next question in that we do see
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial ag kind of moving into the
cannabis scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think is a role they can play
that's not going to be the downfall?
[SPEAKER_00]: And more importantly, do you think there's
anything that they're already currently
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that could be brought to the
cannabis industry that we just haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: adopted yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let me, let me, let me divide the ag
thing into two.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first is sort of the information ag.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the magazines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, there are a gazillion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sitting on the floor here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are gazillion, a gazillion magazines
on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Too many.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, I've written a couple of
articles that have not been printed
[SPEAKER_03]: because I write articles like,
no, don't use this product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't use that product.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, these are bad people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody associated with glyphosate
shouldn't be trusted, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they won't print them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the space has been invaded.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we now know, of course, that big ag
and, you know, and big hydro has invaded
[SPEAKER_03]: the space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as well as big bad guy,
good guys, you get bad guys as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that has happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so the information that you get may be
wrong in the first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that worries me quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you pick up a magazine, you can't
trust the advertising.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't, don't trust the advertising.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what else to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the first problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second problem, of course,
is that big ag tends to have the idea that
[SPEAKER_03]: they're going to do oils in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's, they're not,
they're not in it for individual flowers
[SPEAKER_03]: yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see, you know, a big tobacco
company saying, okay, we're going to make
[SPEAKER_03]: tobacco, then we're going to make cannabis
joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will come for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure there'll be cigar companies
that will make blunts.
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now it seems to me that what big
ag is interested in is being able to
[SPEAKER_03]: produce enough leaf that they're able to,
you know, make oils out of and waxes and
[SPEAKER_03]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I don't, I don't know whether
that's healthy for the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mean that in terms of lung
problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ability to be able to grow indoors at
a greenhouse is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ability to be able to use good
lighting is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that big ag can bring that and
the electronic, the electronics that they
[SPEAKER_03]: have associated with them into the
cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you, you know, as well as I know
that when someone sits in a tractor these
[SPEAKER_03]: days, it's more like sitting in a living
room than it is, you know, it's like being
[SPEAKER_03]: in a Tesla, television sets and satellite
navigation and all that kind of garbage
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, but you know, a lot of that stuff
probably makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Light deprivation, new greenhouse
materials, the ability to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: control water and save water and purify
the ability to be able to control mildew,
[SPEAKER_03]: all that kind of stuff, I think makes a
lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the genetic testing, not
associated with the cannabis itself,
[SPEAKER_03]: but genetic testing associated with the,
the diseases and the viruses and the bugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the things that feed it, all that kind
of stuff is going to be helpful and is
[SPEAKER_03]: being applied already.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if that answers your
question, but I think there is a lot in
[SPEAKER_03]: big ag.
[SPEAKER_03]: I worry, they don't know what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I worry about the little guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I, you know, I'm always reminded
about the wine industry and that there's
[SPEAKER_03]: always room for the low label and the
little label, etc, etc.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't, I don't want to see cannabis
turned into a mass produced, chemically
[SPEAKER_03]: sprayed, grown, bad for you item.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't think there's any excuse
for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I'm a little bit embarrassed
about how we've, how we've gone about
[SPEAKER_03]: legalization, because I don't think we've
done it the right way.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't, we haven't looked at this from
any other, any other way than we need,
[SPEAKER_03]: we need to convince governments and the
only way to convince governments is with
[SPEAKER_03]: money taxation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the wrong way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was way off track.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was, it was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to even follow that up with a
kind of a complex issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't been able to dive into too much
in the past, but I think you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be perfect for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know for a fact that there are
companies out there such as molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: farms and their parent companies who are
genetically modifying cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically to do things like so that
every plant is expressing the exact same
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype, same height and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is that like they can be
perfectly harvested by like a combine in
[SPEAKER_00]: the field that's just going to optimize to
pick them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fear is that one of the things they're
doing is modifying the terpene profiles so
[SPEAKER_00]: that, for example, there's zero mercin and
the fear is that these are such
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically dominant plants that if they
do hermaphrodite, which you hope they
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't, but if they do, and there's a
big field of this, if that pollen were to
[SPEAKER_00]: get into some regular stock, it would
essentially wipe out the gene for say
[SPEAKER_00]: mercin in this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time, you know, worst case
scenario has man gone too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could lose certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's a realistic fear or
it's a bit of paranoia?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think it is a fear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's some realism to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people in Oregon, for example,
worry about hemp, you know, the pollen
[SPEAKER_03]: from hemp giving onto the pollen from,
you know, to a medical cannabis farm,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it can be a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we have to, you know,
we treated this thing so badly for so
[SPEAKER_03]: long, you know, that there aren't enough
lines of communication so we can talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about these things and kind of make it
work out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I think there's a potential
problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just have to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to pay attention to it and we have
to have control of it, not government
[SPEAKER_03]: that's interested in money.
[SPEAKER_03]: We shouldn't care about the money.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should care about the health and the
impact on ourselves and the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's gotta be number one when it comes
to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not fall into the trap where it's
just money talks, because that's what
[SPEAKER_03]: happens as we know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the idea of genetic modification and
it may turn out right now, I think the
[SPEAKER_03]: jury is out in terms of part of the
genetic modification issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the jury is right on the mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: If genetic modification is being used so
that they can spray the plant with a
[SPEAKER_03]: pesticide, then it's absolutely no way.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's being used to make the plant a
better plant and you can control it,
[SPEAKER_03]: then possibly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even then, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for years and years and years
and centuries and centuries and centuries,
[SPEAKER_03]: we've been able to breed this plant the
way we want to with regular breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's wrong with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until we can figure it out, until we can
figure it out, let's not screw things up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the scary thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last little question on the kind of
legal side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, we've heard the sent comment
that 215 in California was maybe not the
[SPEAKER_00]: best idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: What legal changes would you like to see
to kind of create a more conducive
[SPEAKER_00]: environment for the cannabis market to
thrive for all growers, not just the big
[SPEAKER_00]: ones?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really difficult question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I always say this is an Alaskan.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing is no bill gets passed
using the word marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a word that I cannot stand and I
don't think anybody who ever touches
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis should ever use because in the
United States, this is a word that was
[SPEAKER_03]: dredged up by a guy named Harry Anslinger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Harry Anslinger was head of the tobacco
and alcohol administration when
[SPEAKER_03]: prohibition was ending.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he went, oh, what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what are my people going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's the guy that started the
worldwide paranoia over the use of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, which he called marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you use the word marijuana,
you're putting a you're putting a statue
[SPEAKER_03]: up to Harry Anslinger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Harry Anslinger caused Australia,
Bolivia, Colombia, London, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Ottawa to pass these draconian terrible,
terrible laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first thing I would do is make sure
that everybody uses the word cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what this plant is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know marijuana is a word in Spanish.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was used once, but not very often.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would I would reduce the taxation
element.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this has just become way out of
hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would definitely in the United States,
we have a serious problem where where the
[SPEAKER_03]: disproportionate number of minority
citizens have been put away as a result of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Problems in the past, the prohibition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would have laws that give an
advantage to to minorities that have been
[SPEAKER_03]: impacted for a certain period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and beyond that, I don't have enough
expertise, but I know the system is
[SPEAKER_03]: broken.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that in California, there is a
wild, wicked, you know, illegal market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very violent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's and it's very healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think I think the fact that that
exists tells me that the law failed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a terrible problem in Alaska that I
think most other places have.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's way too many restrictions on this
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way too many restrictions.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you grow it next to a school,
so what?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you grow it next to a church,
sorry, it's just a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was a period of time when
people in the United States thought that
[SPEAKER_03]: tomato plant was poisonous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, you could need a tomato
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just a plant, folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as such, we need to start treating it
like a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we need to get a little bit of
taxation.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, I can understand that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so far, we've seen that crime rates
have gone down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drug rates among teenagers have gone down.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's probably been an increase in
driving, I would imagine, although I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know whether that's necessarily bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it is, then let's do a little bit
of taxation so that we can we can
[SPEAKER_03]: ameliorate that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But goodness gracious, this is not the be
wall answer there.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is this is not going to pay for my
health care.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to treat we need to treat the
plant like a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to have laws that treat the plant
like a plant, not like this is some kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of a syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to be very careful that we don't
give licenses just to a few, which which a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of states in the United States have
done.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we just we just got to pay
attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a wide open thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm too old to but I am so thankful that
it is legal in so many places in the
[SPEAKER_03]: United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will be around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: No question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems like the tides are turning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the next section, we're just going
to jump on to some fan submitted
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just some more kind of short ones,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first question is, do you know if
plants release root exudates if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: being fed salts or in a hydro environment?
[SPEAKER_03]: They might, but they might not.
[SPEAKER_03]: They they put the exudates out in response
to a need.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they're being fed, then they don't
need to waste their synthetic their
[SPEAKER_03]: photosynthetic energy to produce the
exudates.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a hydro environment, you can get you
can get exudates, but you don't get nearly
[SPEAKER_03]: as many.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, they don't have any
purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you don't want them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next one looks like from a reader who's
maybe read your new book, they've said,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have a favorite auto flowering
company and do you have any tips for
[SPEAKER_00]: training auto flowers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I like Mephisto genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're they're a good, you know,
international company.
[SPEAKER_03]: They really have some terrific seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And boy, oh, boy, are they on top of their
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as training, what I think I'm
coming to the conclusion is that it's it's
[SPEAKER_03]: best not to train.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't I I wish that the people like
Mephisto and they're getting much better
[SPEAKER_03]: at it would would tell you this is a plant
that should be pinched or this is a plant
[SPEAKER_03]: that should not be pinched.
[SPEAKER_03]: But other than, you know, other than
pinching, I think the training is is
[SPEAKER_03]: really counterproductive and even pinching
and pinching.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think really that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't train your plant after the after
the first grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it looks like it could it could have
been go ahead and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and I've tried I've tried it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've tried tying them down and
pinching and, you know, squeeze and all
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, it's spread the stuff out
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, these are such a great,
easy plants to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're so fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't need very much training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next question kind of similarly
related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever noticed an increased
prevalence of intersex traits in
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflowers or have you noticed what some
describe as a common terpene amongst
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflowers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get different different growers,
you get different terpene profiles for
[SPEAKER_03]: sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think some of the smaller newer growers
are using a smaller gene pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they don't have quite the quite the
that's one of the reasons why I like
[SPEAKER_03]: Mephisto.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the big guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't you know, I love Mephisto.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's terrific people.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's also a thing called
autoflowering.net.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I think people might want to go on
to, which has lists a lot of different
[SPEAKER_03]: growers, a lot of different different
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and you can find them as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you tend to get the yeah, you tend to
get kind of the same out of the same
[SPEAKER_03]: grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that may be true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't I haven't really grown enough to
really know that whether that's but I got
[SPEAKER_03]: to tell you what I got was good enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't complain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yummy, yummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a huge fan of Mephisto as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next question, this one I should have
asked so very near and dear to my heart is
[SPEAKER_00]: this is how I actually found out about
your book.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about the revs True
Living Organics?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met him when I was a young kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, no, there's there are a lot of
great books out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and I think it's important that people
get a good library of different kinds of
[SPEAKER_03]: books.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and refer to them as many times they
possibly can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's the the the the library
field is I mean, the cannabis field is
[SPEAKER_03]: getting incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I tend to stay away from the from
the pornographic ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So recently we've seen a lot of discussion
around the topic of defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you've said in the past,
you're anti defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you mind giving us an explanation as
to why you are that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, two reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is if you've got a good light,
you want to have as many light receivers
[SPEAKER_03]: as you possibly can, period.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every one of those families that
you're taking off your plant because you
[SPEAKER_03]: think you're getting better air
circulation is a is a factory of thousands
[SPEAKER_03]: of gazillions of chloroplasts that are
feeding your plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's just counterproductive to
remove those unless you absolutely have to
[SPEAKER_03]: move your fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a different air system, but do not
take off leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you've got a really good light
setup, you're way ahead by leaving those
[SPEAKER_03]: those leaves on.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're and if you've got a lousy light
setup, you're way ahead by leaving those
[SPEAKER_03]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just factories.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to have as many as you possibly
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next one is a really good question,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever considered getting your
books turned into audio books?
[SPEAKER_00]: And would you consider doing The Voice if
so?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure I could pronounce all the
words, for goodness sakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I would I would certainly
consider it, but I'd rather have it in
[SPEAKER_03]: Spanish or Chinese.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's it's in electronic versions,
but it's not in audio.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't you know, I don't know what that
process is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd have to ask my my my publisher.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know whether whether they do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I would certainly do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you'd want my voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you'd want let's get some some
really, you know, somebody really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim Belushi.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have you been keeping up to date with
any of the new lighting technology?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, have you got any thoughts on
the new plasma lights?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love plasma lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: I advise a company called Second Son Light
On Demand.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's just incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plasma lights are phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: The old days, you used to have to have two
different kinds of plasma lights,
[SPEAKER_03]: one for flowering, one for vegging.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this particular light that I'm that
I'm interested in, it weighs about,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, 10 to 15 pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't put out any heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It uses about half the electrical output
wattage.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the cat's meow and it grows the
finest cannabis you have ever,
[SPEAKER_03]: ever, ever, ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just spectacular.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't I don't have one yet, but I want
one so I can grow my auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_03]: auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, I'd like to keep mine on a 24
hour, 24 hour light cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you go 24 hour light cycle with a
plasma light, auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cremolo.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a yield like you cannot believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the taste, though the I mean,
my God, it's just incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I like plasma lights an awful
lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: They last a very long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing that people don't realize when
they buy an LED light, they break.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't last forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: They end up in the landfill.
[SPEAKER_03]: These these plasma lights are a little bit
more expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I would I would highly
encourage people to take a look at the
[SPEAKER_03]: second sun, knowing that I I do advise
these guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is this is the light.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and, you know, there's no substitute.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we do as growers very often is we try
to skimp.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, now, normally you're growing a plant
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where it's supposed to grow under a
good sunlight.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last thing in the world you want to
skimp is your light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a terrible thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growing cannabis is a three legged stool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to grow good cannabis,
you have to have good genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's given got to have good soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: From my perspective, it's got to be a
healthy, healthy living soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the third thing is you've got to have
good lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got those three things,
you can't fail to grow good, good
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last question from our little fan
submitted ones is what type of things do
[SPEAKER_00]: you like to to do to get rid of bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for example, if you had russet
mites, what might you do to help get rid
[SPEAKER_00]: of them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm a big believer.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, if you're if you're a
commercial grower, you have got to have on
[SPEAKER_03]: call an IPM specialist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Simple, simple as that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have an IPM specialist,
you're crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can never pronounce the names of any of
these things, but I'm a big, big believer.
[SPEAKER_03]: IPM.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you when you start out, however,
with a good, healthy soil, the opportunity
[SPEAKER_03]: for the soil food web to start taking out
your problems on its own is increased
[SPEAKER_03]: many, many, many, many times.
[SPEAKER_03]: But russet mites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, russet mites is one of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did I hear about russet mites?
[SPEAKER_03]: russet mites were sprayed in the United
States by one of the utilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the rumor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Utility companies in order to kill the
vegetation underneath the wires.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean those russet mites in California
all come from and people have it like
[SPEAKER_03]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can use UV lights, you know,
that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always like to do that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to out compete.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to know what lifecycle stages the
problem is going to go through.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to find something in the soil
food web medicine chip.
[SPEAKER_03]: That out competes that guy for space for
food and you know that puts out an
[SPEAKER_03]: antibiotic that doesn't like there's
something out there for anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the best place to go is get on the web
right away and contact an IPM specialist
[SPEAKER_03]: because they know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And chances are that whoever you're
contacting that he or she has already been
[SPEAKER_03]: contacted by 13 people, your neighbors and
everybody else, because they got the same
[SPEAKER_03]: problems that you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they know how to take care of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's how you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on to our last two or three questions
before we wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So favorite one we like to ask people,
what is your favorite or the best weed
[SPEAKER_00]: you've ever smoking in your whole life?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Durbin poison.
[SPEAKER_03]: Durbin poison from Oregon's finest.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a dispensary here in town.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my friends has a farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: He grows the Durbin poison for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a delicious, uplifting, terrific,
terrific cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just simply love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, because I vaporize flour,
I'm always looking for good flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, hemp is pretty good to
vaporize.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to say it's delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hemp that's grown in Oregon is all CBG
hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting medical properties to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Durbin poison.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's without question my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the other end of the spectrum,
what is the least memorable or the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: that least impressed you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, that would have to be the
weed from the very, very first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very first time I got stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: My good friend Jeremy Platt and I,
we must have gone through 30, 40 pipes
[SPEAKER_03]: full.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we finally got stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because back in 1970, let's see,
what was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
1968.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was right before tie sticks and all
sorts of great weeds started coming into
[SPEAKER_03]: the United States from Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_03]: But boy, the early weed was terrible
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terrible stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never want to go back to that again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sticks and seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Headaches for those of you who have never
tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were sent to a desert island,
you could only have two or three strains
[SPEAKER_00]: with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which ones would you want to take?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think I'd probably take,
depending on whether I was limited to auto
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have to take a couple of regular
plants to do some breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would want to have, because I think
it's probably a pretty quick grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Blue Dream is very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good, easy grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to take any of Mephisto's
wonderful plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Hubba Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hubba Bubba Smell-o.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smell-o.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hubba Bubba Smell-o.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I love that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was just terrific.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would take that.
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, I would grab whatever I could
get.
[SPEAKER_03]: People give me seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get seeds all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just like to grow any of it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all turns out to be good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, if you grow your cannabis
organically and you provide those
[SPEAKER_03]: necessary elements that go into those
terrific enzymes that are in your plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those 10,000 individual enzymes of which
there are 1,000 of each are going to do
[SPEAKER_03]: some incredible things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just all it really takes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is such a wonderful hobby.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just so easy to do and it's just so
much fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hardly shut me up, as you can
tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to do a modified final
question just for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could go back anywhere in like
the history of time, any place you want,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can get some humus from anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where and when are you going?
[SPEAKER_03]: Humus from anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to go to Siberia and get some
good humus from Siberia, untouched by
[SPEAKER_03]: human hands, untouched by pollution or
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got pretty much a lot of that in
Anchorage.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean in Alaska, but I'd like to go to a
really remote Siberian location that was
[SPEAKER_03]: just full of humus and get it from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have any shout outs or comments
you'd like to make?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I hope everybody certainly
tokes up as soon as we hang up the Skype.
[SPEAKER_03]: My books are all available on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly buy them.
[SPEAKER_03]: My publishers will really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not make very much money off of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am Gardener Jeff on Twitter,
not very often on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am Gardener Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff at Gardener dot com.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to ask any questions,
if you got any advising that needs to be
[SPEAKER_03]: done, I got a great team we can send your
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see, I'm going to Dublin in
March 3rd and 4th, and then I hope I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be in Australia sometime in the
first couple of weeks of April.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we'll set something up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds exciting.

[SPEAKER_00]: just in general, in broader, for all the
