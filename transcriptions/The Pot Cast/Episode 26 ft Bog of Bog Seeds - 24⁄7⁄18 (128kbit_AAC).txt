[SPEAKER_03]: On this episode, we're joined by Bushy Old
Grower, otherwise known as Bog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here to get some old school knowledge,
some predictions for the future and some
[SPEAKER_03]: other cool tidbits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so I'd like to welcome onto the
show a true veteran of the scene,
[SPEAKER_03]: a man known as Bushy Old Grower or simply
Bog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it and I'm happy to talk to
your folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a little deviation from the normal
first question.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you currently smoking on at the
moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my wife and I are old school,
you know, been smoking many years together
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're smoking my Sour Bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an elite breeder clone that we've had
like 17 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Sour Bubble is really a very unusual
selection out of my straight bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was supposed to be straight bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was bubble gum from Amsterdam and I
called it Bog Bubble, my version of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and we grew that for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every once in a while and with the
originals, we noticed that there were an
[SPEAKER_01]: occasional different phenotype and it
wasn't always exactly the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: but compared to bubble gum, the Sour
Bubble, as I called it, was a darker green
[SPEAKER_01]: and looked a lot like its leaf structure
and plant structure like pre-98 Bubba
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't quite have that kind of
flavor, but it's kind of almost as cushy
[SPEAKER_01]: as bubble gummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for like a Bubba Kush,
it's kind of unusually cushy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had it tested when we originally
had that clone cut and that was up in Anna
[SPEAKER_01]: when we lived in Bozeman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was 30.5% resin weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's all the THC's and the CBD's and
all that put together, but back at that
[SPEAKER_01]: time, which was like, you know,
2001, I think, that was a really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really high THC clone that we selected out
of the bubble gum that was normally much
[SPEAKER_01]: lower, you know, more in the range of
around 20% THC usually, just delicious and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, you know, but this was a lot
stronger and a lot tighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It maybe didn't yield quite as much,
but we had that Sour Bubble clone and we
[SPEAKER_01]: all just loved it, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The high is really quite indica-sided.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably my most indica strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it even has a little trait of the leaf
hands where like pre-98 Bubba Kush,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the tiniest little leaves sticks up
like a finger, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the three stooges in a teacup with their
little finger sticking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody's showing me a picture of their
pre-98 Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you found the Sour Bubble
clone, was your first thought like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to find the male version of this
since you had the seed stock?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had two or three of these different
versions and we decided this clone,
[SPEAKER_01]: this was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just calling it Super Bog Bubble
at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my son, who's also, you know,
oh, he's a 42 year old man down.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a man at the time, was helping me
and he decided, and I did, that this was
[SPEAKER_01]: the one we definitely wanted to keep this
clone and breed with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we were growing from seed
commercially up there in Montana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I may have inadvertently violated a
few statutes, but in Montana, a man's home
[SPEAKER_01]: misses castle and you can pretty much do
what you want to do in your home and they
[SPEAKER_01]: can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get a search warrant for in a
private owner's home at all, even if they
[SPEAKER_01]: think they're fairly safe growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did it back in Michigan too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had kept growing the Bog Bubble,
which was supposed to be straight bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: gum, but was obviously really above a
kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took two years of continuously
growing from seed to come up with the
[SPEAKER_01]: male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I finally did and it just appeared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could smell it and you could see
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was obviously a sour bubble male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, you know, a gift from
above.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly, I had been hoping and
not seeing anything like it because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: quite different than the bubble gum
version that I have, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: isolated in the Bog Bubble side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were able then to make that
first cross and then keep back crossing to
[SPEAKER_01]: the original clone selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sour bubble became a big hit back
at the same time on Overgrow, which was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, the big mega site back
then that the guy I sent my seeds to came
[SPEAKER_01]: out with what was called OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the first OG Kush that any of
us at Overgrow have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's all kinds of stories about
where it came from, but I knew that he had
[SPEAKER_01]: it and he sent me seeds and clones of his
version.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew that we both had, you know,
different versions and I didn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I didn't call mine that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came up with the name Sour Bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And who is that person online?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy did acknowledge this.
[SPEAKER_01]: His clone no longer exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be something to be
investigated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I mean, back in the day,
we just, you know, knew each other by
[SPEAKER_01]: names and stuff and didn't keep anybody
names or addresses, but I had sent him my
[SPEAKER_01]: Bog Bubble seeds and my Bogglegum seeds,
which is Bog Bubble crossed with NL5.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had, had selected this clone out of
either one or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even sure which one, but I had
assumed out of the Bog Bubble.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we take a step back all the way to
the start now, before we get too deep into
[SPEAKER_03]: things, what was your first experience
with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I was only 13 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had moved from Birmingham,
Michigan to Algonac, Michigan,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was on the water on the St. Clair
River, which is part of the Great Lake
[SPEAKER_01]: system and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the new friends I met and we had boats
and stuff and we could go camp on this
[SPEAKER_01]: island called Gull Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just paradise for like young
teenagers, no parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I mean, we could take beer
or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of my friends from Birmingham
came up to visit and go with us to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had brought some pot for me to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know why, but he didn't even
want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had just gotten, it was like enough to
fill up a good size tobacco pipe and it
[SPEAKER_01]: probably had a few seeds in it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyhow, I was the only one who smoked
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got to the island, we set up our
little tent or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody was having a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember I sat down and I smoked
that whole pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we were, we were cigarette smokers
anyhow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I didn't have much trouble at age
13, token down that big tobacco pipe full
[SPEAKER_01]: of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was probably like some Mexican weed
with a few seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got a damn good buzz off it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it took me about 15 minutes to
smoke it, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was a fun night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you, man, this island is only
about, I don't know, half a mile long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just sand with a few trees on it,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can run around the whole damn
thing in about half an hour, probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: But me and it was two or three other guys
were out there after I got high and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: running around on the beach and fooling
around the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd never been stoned before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I knew was I was happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was having a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before I knew it, they see that
they're laughing at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is my one little friend who had
brought the tobacco up, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: the marijuana up for me to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was laughing the hardest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looked to me like he was,
he was putting his pecker away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, you didn't even notice,
did you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I says, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, I peed on your leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're like standing in the
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, I had not, I had not felt any pee
hit my leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, you did not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, so anyhow, that was the
first, you know, adventure, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: on pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I could tell you what
happened is we fooled around out there for
[SPEAKER_01]: a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended up, I went back to the tent and I
had the munchies like mad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, I actually, I ate like a dozen
donuts and drank like a two liter bottle
[SPEAKER_01]: of cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I probably smoked about a pack of
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a damn good night.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from there, did you, you know,
decide that weed was your thing and you
[SPEAKER_03]: began to smoke it regularly?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or was there some time before you become
like a regular smoker and got really
[SPEAKER_03]: engulfed in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I don't think that was actually one
of those like totally addicting moments
[SPEAKER_01]: though, because no, I wasn't right out
seeking it or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to me though, that the next
time I got high, that a buddy of mine and
[SPEAKER_01]: I, and I don't know, I can't remember
that, but we got high and we went to a
[SPEAKER_01]: carnival and we rolled the Lupo plane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the one where you hold the
break and the eggs sort of go upside down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you lose all the change in your
pockets, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's how they get a
little extra money for the carnies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had a ball on that ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that ride and me and the buddy,
us making that thing spin and we were so
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the second time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the time that I really
thought, geez, I've got to have this weed
[SPEAKER_01]: more often.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it took a couple of happy
evenings on it to then be convinced,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and I, and I was then getting in
there for an age of like, for sure by 16,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, but I think at 15, I had weed about
half of the time because we could get bags
[SPEAKER_01]: of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't very good, but a lid of weed,
which was like, you know, maybe a half an
[SPEAKER_01]: ounce even for, for as little as 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe 12 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a guy named Chief that we had
Indians that lived across the river.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in Algonac, it wasn't too hard to
find a guy named Chief who might sell a
[SPEAKER_01]: kid some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And me and a buddy could, could get a lid
from him for $12 usually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, that's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at what point did you decide you wanted
to start growing yourself and not just be
[SPEAKER_03]: a buyer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we, teenagers in high school were
experimenting with growing pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We lived in Michigan, which is a very
northerly state in the U S and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you, you, you get a fairly,
and of course we didn't really have the
[SPEAKER_01]: right kind of seeds that would finish
early enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remember that we were growing a few
plants in the woods behind a friend of
[SPEAKER_01]: mine's house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back when we were only like 15,
but we weren't having much success,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we got some leaves and I remember that
his name was Todd and, and he was,
[SPEAKER_01]: he had, he had a bag of leaves,
you know, that he chopped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course we smoked some of them and,
and he was actually rolling joints and
[SPEAKER_01]: selling joints in school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I recall, they were, you know,
like really cheap, you know, like he,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember how cheap, maybe they
might've even been as cheap as three for a
[SPEAKER_01]: dollar and you know, like 50 cents.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20% joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I recall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they really weren't worth any more
than that because you know, they couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have had like more than a half of a
percent of THC, but you know, when your
[SPEAKER_01]: kids bought anything you can get,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did actually though, start trying to
grow and earn us shortly after I got
[SPEAKER_01]: married.
[SPEAKER_01]: My, my wife and I got married when we were
18.
[SPEAKER_01]: Years old and not cause we had to,
we had been going steady into high school
[SPEAKER_01]: years for two and a half, three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a wonderful girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Pat and I got married and then we had
had this apartment for a year up at the
[SPEAKER_01]: college where I was going to school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my dad bought an old farmhouse just
cause he was buying the property up in
[SPEAKER_01]: that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had some family up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in central Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, Oh, there was this old
vacant house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went and looked at it and asked if I
could live in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once we were out there, which is like
when I probably was less than 19,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was probably still 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were growing weed outside and you know,
I was working on outdoor growing and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was kind of difficult, but you know,
I had some limited success and we were
[SPEAKER_01]: still usually mostly having to buy from
somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, we, we always managed to
have a little bit of it around and did
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually get better at growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did eventually get some plants to flower
in the summertime and realized how good
[SPEAKER_01]: since Amelia could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was before I really even knew
what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was probably in about 74.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really what helped me living in Michigan
was they came out with something called a
[SPEAKER_01]: halide light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was already growing indoors before
the halide light was invented.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had been doing high output
fluorescence grow tubes that were like
[SPEAKER_01]: eight feet long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also had some regular fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four foot things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had a room that could,
uh, it was, you know, equivalent to maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: a thousand watt room now or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One big row of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had some limited success with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then with the limited genetics that I
was able to obtain back then, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would tend to get things that were,
you know, that would run under lights like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the halide light came out,
all of a sudden I was able to grow top
[SPEAKER_01]: grade since Amelia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I had also upgraded from my own
seeds that I had worked on for years,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, even back in Michigan,
uh, but that I had then brought out to
[SPEAKER_01]: Montana when I moved out there and in
earnest started trying to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: work on seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I even, well, I went through a whole
progression of different stages,
[SPEAKER_01]: but finally got some, um, genetics from
Amsterdam and some from Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and that sort of got my company
started without intending to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the stuff you were working on prior to
that, did you, do you still use any of
[SPEAKER_03]: that at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it kind of just being outdated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the first things that I worked with
were from Michigan and some of it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: bag seed that I had crossed to this one
strain that a friend of mine had in
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, he had an indoor halide
light too, but he had done some outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: growing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his strain was called Blanchard
strain, which Blanchard is a small town in
[SPEAKER_01]: central Michigan, very rural, but his,
his plant I remember was just delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I crossed, I had, you know,
what I called red.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was my own original first train and my
strain red tasted good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and people liked it, but,
uh, his strain, the Blanchard strain was a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot stronger and it seemed more Indica
sided and very sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it must've had some skunk in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I'm not sure what else,
but it was a very sweet with the very
[SPEAKER_01]: bitter skunky leaves, you know,
and it just, that hard to say for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it wasn't like anything from
local, but, uh, stuff that had been around
[SPEAKER_01]: back when, uh, the Grateful Dead were
passing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there something like the long time ago?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they, uh, actually neither of those
strains ended up in any of the work did
[SPEAKER_01]: once we were selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, I don't have those anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just be so old.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they wouldn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have had luck with seeds older than 10
years old and I do keep old seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but no, I don't have those anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: In, when you look on your library with all
the genetics you've collected over the
[SPEAKER_03]: years, is there any older stock that
you've got in there that you might want to
[SPEAKER_03]: work with, but you're thinking,
Oh, it's a bit old.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might not really be able to get it to
germinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I see what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we of course are always working on
something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, with my company and the way I do
things, sometimes it's a long time between
[SPEAKER_01]: a new strain because we got up to like 15
strains and, uh, it became difficult as a
[SPEAKER_01]: small mom and pop operation to keep them
all in stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't like discontinuing strains too
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I, you know, my niche is old school
and I try to preserve the genetics as I
[SPEAKER_01]: got them originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I, I have wonderful genetics that I
was gifted by friends that people,
[SPEAKER_01]: when they knew that I was a breeder at
overgrow and we were actually selling my
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was the first American breeder to
sell seeds worldwide through gypsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, nobody was doing that from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I brought a couple other guys in,
uh, reservoir seeds, rest dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: He became a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he, he was a friend of mine
and I was the one who talked gypsy into
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing him in because he had so many
good genetics, you know, but in my old
[SPEAKER_01]: school genetics and in res dog would say
this, that, that bog had the gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact is that the way we worked and
progressed in each of our strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: all my strains have bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, they used to call me the
bubble gum guru.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little story about the bubble
gum that I'd like to tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I was a little kid,
I was a little businessman of a little
[SPEAKER_01]: kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was always, uh, thinking about how to
buy something cheap and sell it high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I mean, when I was only 10 years
old, I was buying and selling switchblade
[SPEAKER_01]: knives that I got some from Italy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also, when we were traveling,
managed it to gamble and use slot machines
[SPEAKER_01]: and make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was always thinking about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when I was really young,
one of the first times I got any money in
[SPEAKER_01]: my hand was like $5, you know,
and I went down to the horse stable where
[SPEAKER_01]: they sold bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why this story is because I got a
box with 500 pieces of bubble gum in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was my first stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the gateway drug they talk about,
pure sugar, and it tasted like bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took that box of bubble gum and I
took it home and I guess I had to stash it
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hid it in the garage and I found a
spot in the garage and luckily the mice
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't get them or maybe they got some and
I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I used to go and grab any 20 pieces or
so of my bubble gum and head to the movie
[SPEAKER_01]: theater and, you know, I'd be chewing
bubble gum like a wacko.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was an abuser of bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when I got bubble gum seeds from
Amsterdam later when I was a grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: the last thing I really expected,
what darn buds would actually smell like
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we grew the plants and we hoped for
the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the plants got to be like four
weeks in before I was fooling around and
[SPEAKER_01]: sniffing them and I rubbed a stash,
smelled my fingers and my mouth dropped
[SPEAKER_01]: open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how do you, how could that be
possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went up and I told my wife and son,
we're both upstairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was living in Montana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a Montana basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was only like five feet high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to stoop all the time and you
couldn't use big lights because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: height restriction, but it smelled like
bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went up and I told them that and
they both doubted my word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you believe that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dad tells them and they don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, look, you go down there
and you just check it out for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they both came back upstairs and their
mouths were hanging open too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you, bubble gum really
smells like bubble gum before it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like, how is that possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, well, the name that's on the seeds
there, you know, it's actually supposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: be bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we grew that and we were amazed for
one thing that it was a decent yielder and
[SPEAKER_01]: that we really liked the high,
the Indica high was very relaxing and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we thought it was plenty strong enough
for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I thought most about it was,
it was like candy that who cares if it
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't the strongest thing you could grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't as strong as skunk or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just couldn't believe how yummy it
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, that's all we smoked for years
until we got hooked on the sour bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that ended up being like,
we've got totally addicted to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of things I'm going to have
to ask questions about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first one is, do you remember who
you got your bubble gum from breeder wise?
[SPEAKER_03]: And is it the same as the one Adam Dunn
took over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, you know, it's drunkers
bubble gum and he deserves some credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: My seeds were obtained through white label
seed company before they called it double
[SPEAKER_01]: gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did call it bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a small selection of those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he was the third guy who
also had cloned the real bubble gum clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I say, yeah, you know, I met and talked
to Adam and the other guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only one I didn't meet and talk to
was Ben drunkers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the next question I had,
which I think everyone wants to know,
[SPEAKER_03]: is basically a lot of people sent me
questions asking me to ask you about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought I better bring it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your relationship with the infamous res
dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question which struck me the most
was a lot of people are familiar with sour
[SPEAKER_03]: dub, but they may not, you know,
realize that it's obviously like a collab
[SPEAKER_03]: between you and res.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did that happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how did you meet res?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, rest dog and I were friends online
back in the overgrown days and the icy mag
[SPEAKER_01]: days from before he was a seed dealer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sour dub was across.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made of the New York City diesel from
Soma to my sour bubble clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't have anything to do with
any of res dogs genetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I missed out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just I might end up having to cut
this question out because it looks like I
[SPEAKER_03]: made a blunder there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But did you guys do a collab?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I maybe just misspoke when I said
sour dub.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question isn't wrong, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you, there's definitely been
some rumors around about either sour dub
[SPEAKER_01]: or sour bubble somehow being some kind of
joint project between a rest dog and me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure he would confirm that that's
that's really not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: He may have sent me a few seeds at one
time or another, but as far as the sour
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble and the sour double and,
you know, with the sour double,
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't take that too far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave those first cross seeds to my dub
out here in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he worked with that first cross seeds
and gave me credit for the strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I can tell you that my original
cross that I gave him was that's what it
[SPEAKER_01]: was was so much New York City diesel and
my sour bubble clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as it turned out, I should have kept
that and bred that and made that a strain
[SPEAKER_01]: for myself because it turned out to be
really darn good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, a lot of great things have
descended from sour double.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name sour double is a missed because
of the fact that the the sour diesel in my
[SPEAKER_01]: sour double wasn't sour diesel,
but was New York City diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you got sour bubble with one sour
and the other one actually New York City
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't name it that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, OK, I understand what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the other questions I wanted to
ask you about Rez is do you still stay in
[SPEAKER_03]: contact with him and the profile that
popped up recently or, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a few months back, do you know if that was
the actual Rez and if he does plan to
[SPEAKER_03]: return to the scene?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I haven't been in touch with him since
before he had some problems, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we were both doing, you know,
sort of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, no, we haven't been in contact with
each other at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as whether the person who
you're talking about, I haven't seen that
[SPEAKER_01]: or read that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't help you there, but it's
possible it's him.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know, he's out and free and
there could be.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, and so I guess the final question is,
feel free to decline and cut this one out
[SPEAKER_03]: if you don't want to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultimately, do you think he's the snitch
that some people label him as?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly wouldn't have any way to know
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I you know, a lot of these things are are
stuff that people read on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I do know some people and maybe
have had some inside stories, nobody ever
[SPEAKER_01]: convinced me that he's on anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess not that he did, but I sure
can't say that he did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we just jump back to another point
you mentioned with the bubblegum story,
[SPEAKER_03]: your relationship with Gypsy, Gypsy is an
interesting guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's not that many people around
who had like a working relationship with
[SPEAKER_03]: him who are still active.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your take on the Gypsy situation?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, have you had any contact
with him after he got out of jail,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think at the start of the year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, but I'm not really in regular contact
with him now, but I did you did have an
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange online since he got out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that a wonderful friend of ours,
a Buddhist who sort of brought me into
[SPEAKER_01]: Buddhism and his name is Tom, actually
went over to the Philippines and sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: paid Gypsy's way out of this horrible like
detention facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he was never convicted of any
crime or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact is that that's all it took
was money to get him out of their corrupt
[SPEAKER_01]: system, you know, to be held without being
charged with a crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they tried to send him back to the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he actually fought as they were trying
to board him on the plane that was going
[SPEAKER_01]: to take him to the US because the US
wanted to extradite him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because he caused a commercial,
they took him back to the holding
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he ended up not being extradited to
the US, lucky for him, because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, guys like him, they really would
throw the book at him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think the interesting thing about
Gypsy is it's kind of like back at that
[SPEAKER_03]: same time frame as when Overgrow was
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you have kind of the the cool
fact of being able to say you were the
[SPEAKER_03]: 12th member on Overgrow, which is
obviously kind of confirms your OG-ness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think, though, that people look
back on Overgrow with a sort of rose
[SPEAKER_03]: shaded glasses and there's a certain sense
of romanticizing going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think that it is kind of like
what people make it out to be of like
[SPEAKER_03]: where it was this mecca of information and
it's such a shame we don't have something
[SPEAKER_03]: like that anymore?
[SPEAKER_01]: When Overgrow opened, it was like a
birthday present to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you realized what there was
before that was practically nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the British Columbian Seed Company had
a forum thread where there was like one
[SPEAKER_01]: page with one constant thread where people
could add something to the chat line,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember I posted my whole indoor
organic grow tips, you know, for for new
[SPEAKER_01]: growers on that like chat forum thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though it wasn't really meant for
that, they didn't object.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when Overgrow came out,
I right away had the same thread there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it evolved into a thing where for like
years, people would just come in and ask a
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, you know, these were really
long threads.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember they had a room called the
shark's tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was where anything goes,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a thread called the New World
Order.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, you know, it had some
conspiracy theory stuff in it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, Bogg Bush, he'll grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there was a aspect of some
mythology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we were kidding around and joking
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, my great, great,
great, great, great, great granddaddy
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't really an alien who came down to
Egypt with marijuana seeds because the sun
[SPEAKER_01]: is a perfect grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we came up with stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I didn't mean any harm.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a crack up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what was your kind of reaction to
when it all got shut down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was it was horrifying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we were doing business,
we they had each seed company like like,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, gypsy Nirvana and his like seeds
direct at the time or whatever was called.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had our own forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like before Overgrow actually shut
down, R.C., who ran Overgrow and was
[SPEAKER_01]: connected with B.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seed Bank and stuff, decided to close down
all the private seed forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which had sort of put us off of the public
pages and into our own forums so that we
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't offend.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what Overgrow was all about and
teaching each other how to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to talk about Overgrow because it
was it was better than you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't over romanticized.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesomely huge for the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Al Gore, he claims he invented
the Internet, but I helped to invent
[SPEAKER_01]: social networking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at Overgrow, we had what was
called karma and you could give somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: good or bad karma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And giving bad karma was bad, but they
actually could.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do it.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I quickly accumulated a lot of good
karma because I was teaching people basic
[SPEAKER_01]: methods of growing indoors in a time when
it was all totally illegal and nobody knew
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it was like to be able to
get this off your computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people were sitting around high
learning how to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as they learned something,
they were teaching it to the next guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was really a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, if you love marijuana,
this is why so many people in the world
[SPEAKER_01]: know me is because I was a big deal at
Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I was just posting my
pictures of my flowers to show off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never had planned on having a seed
company at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was just happy growing my weed
and selling my weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, prices were good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then Gypsy Nirvana, who was the seed
dealer, he saw how popular I was,
[SPEAKER_01]: how many views I had, how much karma I
had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was on there every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was spending 20 hours a week and I was
uploading photos every day and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: showing all kinds of cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot of fun because it was all
new.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Internet was new.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea of posting a picture was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just want to say that my teaching
threads and my picture forum show off
[SPEAKER_01]: threads, we had contests and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overgrow was really pretty far out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it still suffers from the same kind of
things we have now, like we have trolls
[SPEAKER_01]: and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, one year we had this big
contest at Overgrow and there was like
[SPEAKER_01]: five or 10 categories of things people
could win.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the top one was Grower of the Year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yours truly did win Grower of the
Year, the only year that Overgrow did that
[SPEAKER_01]: contest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many people voted for me because of
popularity, not really because I was the
[SPEAKER_01]: best grower, you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was because I had my fan base,
because people liked me, because they
[SPEAKER_01]: could see that I was answering everybody's
questions every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was providing a service where
anybody could come into my thread.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I wasn't the only one,
but my methods were simple and basic and
[SPEAKER_01]: it was all written so that any idiot could
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what would you say is the biggest
difference in the community when comparing
[SPEAKER_03]: things between now and back then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are still sites like that,
like it still exists and runs and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: still some traffic there, but social
networking has evolved, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, everybody's on the Instagram,
the Twitter, the YouTube, and the big
[SPEAKER_01]: sites have sort of like sucked up all the
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Overgrow was a huge mega site in its
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it had over a million members.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that probably wouldn't be that big
a deal now, but not that many people were
[SPEAKER_01]: on the Internet back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounded, you know, even people that
just came one time might have been
[SPEAKER_01]: considered a member, you know,
who knows if they jacked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had a lot of people there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you put something out,
you definitely got a bunch of responses in
[SPEAKER_01]: a hurry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like the way Instagram is now and I
like the way things have evolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: The truth is that it was tedious waiting
through the threads in the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it seems like it evolved in a
natural way where you decide that you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to follow somebody like I'm on Instagram
and you can just, you know, look for bog
[SPEAKER_01]: or bog seeds and you could become a
follower on our feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time I post a new picture or say
something, you get a little notice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, hey, your guy's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have a look?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I get an instant response from
the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where I do most of my stuff now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I agree with a lot of those points.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I guess kind of maybe the last
question about Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were there any people who you saw back in
the early days of Overgrow and you had a
[SPEAKER_03]: feeling they would go on to do bigger
things and, you know, true to form,
[SPEAKER_03]: that prediction has come true.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now maybe they're, you know,
some of the more relevant people in the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm sure that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's been so long ago that,
I mean, I got most of these people like we
[SPEAKER_01]: all we knew each other by was was our
online handles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm not I'm not the best
with names, but I've been out doing events
[SPEAKER_01]: for a long time and we run into each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we do, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like the fact that people recognize
me from Overgrow and that they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: meet me because they really thought I was,
you know, like a huge leader on the site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the time there I was and I was
a good guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, I was always telling
people to be nice and charitable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I I fooled around and maybe
was a little off color sometimes about I
[SPEAKER_01]: would say things like that my plants,
you know, because they were they were
[SPEAKER_01]: girls or since Amelia, that they were my
virgins, you know, and we would make jokes
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes that I guess, you know,
once in a while could have been a little
[SPEAKER_01]: too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were just having fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it compared to some of the stuff you
see out there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overgrow is pretty tame.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed like that was fairly well
moderated and that I know that I couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: get away with just anything and that
neither could anybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So honestly, I think that that sometimes
they're less responsible places where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're, you know, there's chats all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every game's got one and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there's all kinds of trolls
out there being nasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a pretty nice place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that you have put out some soil
mixes of your own, maybe a bit of a
[SPEAKER_03]: redundant question.
[SPEAKER_03]: But are you an organic grower or more like
a synthetic slash bottled nutrients
[SPEAKER_03]: grower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've always promoted organic
methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while some people have said maybe I'm
not always totally organic on everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I had a guy dispute that peat,
you know, like peat moss in your soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's not organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it seems organic to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, if it's not, it's organic enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to stay away from anything
synthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like insecticides and
things like that aren't even legal in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't even buy them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have all kinds of alternative
treatments and things that don't involve
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I've been through all kinds
of things and we've used all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, different stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we know better, you know, like if you
know what you're doing, you don't get too
[SPEAKER_01]: many pests because, you know, there are
good products or if you're doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors, you're not letting any of that
get inside anywhere.
But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess my question then is because
you've probably had a really wide exposure
[SPEAKER_03]: to, you know, over the years, you've tried
a whole bunch of different samples from a
[SPEAKER_03]: variety of different growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think at the absolute pinnacle of
both organic production and synthetic
[SPEAKER_03]: production, do you think there's still a
difference?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think like organic is still the
best when they're both at their optimal
[SPEAKER_03]: levels?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think it's just still,
you know, devil's in the detail type of
[SPEAKER_03]: thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think organic is still best and I'll
tell you why.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that yields can be larger and it's
really not an issue of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think that the flavor is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, all the growers that are
growing outdoors and growing in
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses are also incompetent.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition with organic products that are
grown indoors too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And believe me, that's the best product
and the highest price is given for indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, indoor generally brings a higher
price than the outdoor, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially, you know, if you think you
can get the same quality, I'd like to see
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a controlled environment and,
you know, I know that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but being outdoors is rougher on plants
and finishing plants indoors allows you to
[SPEAKER_01]: get the quality higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so overall, are you just primarily
indoor guy or it is your favorite outdoor
[SPEAKER_03]: or where do you sit?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're mainly indoor growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, you know, we're mainly just a
pretty small grow to produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like not producing a lot of we
just wait for my family and a little
[SPEAKER_01]: extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are trying to downsize in a way
that we pretty much just produce enough
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds to keep the business going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about the level is going right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really don't want to become a huge
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, some of my best friends,
you know, advised me that it is best to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep it small.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does seem to me that it's a lot
less worrisome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we don't have to have employees
or a whole lot of complications because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm I'm getting older.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting ready to retire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm nearly 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I would like to do is just be
able to keep suppliers and distributors
[SPEAKER_01]: and and live economically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to live large anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Frugal man, I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, just kind of touching on
distributors, do you ever get requests
[SPEAKER_03]: from distributors or maybe even fans and
customers, probably the more relevant
[SPEAKER_03]: person to kind of change up some of the
genetics?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess the question I always like to
ask people is when I notice that a breeder
[SPEAKER_03]: tends to stick to a more old school pool
of genetics, a good example is our friend,
[SPEAKER_03]: the mad farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He like you sticks to the old school stuff
that he knows.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that in mind, do you ever consider
giving in to the request to maybe bring in
[SPEAKER_03]: a strain of the month and spice things up
a bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I'm still like the old school
guy who doesn't kind of resist that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because if I really had the
time to do the work with something else,
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think that I'd rather continue to
work on and select from my old school
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not very often.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, OK, there are great strains and
they come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think I should jump on this one or
that one like when sour diesel first
[SPEAKER_01]: showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe better or get some of that
wasn't really my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I really would rather, you know,
be related, but not the same and come up
[SPEAKER_01]: with my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, a project that I'm working on right
now is all my old genetics, but used in a
[SPEAKER_01]: different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another project that I'm considering
doing is taking some high quality pounds
[SPEAKER_01]: from another fine breeder and using that
probably on my sour bubble clone,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it seems to have the genetics
still.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old clone may have declined a bit as
far as the quality of its buds over so
[SPEAKER_01]: many years, but its genetics are still
throwing awesome phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, there is a possibility that
within the next year or two or less than a
[SPEAKER_01]: year that we'll at least be working on
something crossed to my sour bubble that
[SPEAKER_01]: is from someone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, I do have a new strain that is
a cross of a couple of my strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been reselected and worked on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a high yielder and it's more inclined
to be a great outdoor bush.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these also tend to yield well inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a number of strains that are good
yielders and mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where I'm at here, the outdoor growers
need mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're kind of coastal and there's a lot of
growers in California that are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other parts of the country,
everybody in the fall, when the weather
[SPEAKER_01]: turns colder and it gets cold at night,
it doesn't even have to rain for the mold
[SPEAKER_01]: to set in and outdoor growers is really
disappointing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm working on these types of
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: This strain is going to be called
Bluetooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually a cross of my Blue Moon
Rocks and my Sweet Cindy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Sweet Cindy, everybody tended to
think was like mostly going to be like
[SPEAKER_01]: Cinderella 99.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a little Cinderella 99 in it,
but it's a lot more like Sweet Tooth 3.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact is that that's what the sweet
in the Sweet Cindy stands for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the Blue Moon Rocks and the Sweet
Cindy will already has shown to in testing
[SPEAKER_01]: produce some mega fat colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're pretty excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that it's good tasting and good
weed and that it is mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've gone ahead with this cross and we
hope to be releasing it later this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, just to touch on the point you
made about the mold resistance,
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed that you do list in some kind of
descriptions that you like to breed for
[SPEAKER_03]: mold resistance and hardiness in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel that in order to do this,
it's done mostly via a selection process
[SPEAKER_03]: or more of like a byproduct of the fact
that you're breeding and acclimatizing
[SPEAKER_03]: them in an environment which would help to
cater for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for one thing, I'll tell you
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times things boil down to being a
little simpler than you think,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not always.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mold resistant strains are not the
most indica sided ones.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my experience, the sativas being,
you know, not so large, heavy and tight
[SPEAKER_01]: buds just tend to resist it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also the really dark green leafy types
seem to me to be more likely to mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my most indica strains and blue
moon rocks is quite indica sided,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it doesn't mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not just that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did grow in places and you asked,
are you an indoor grower?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we grew outdoors too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of my seeds have been made
outdoors and were made outdoors even if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're also been made indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were thinking about two
different things in our different kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one type of plants, they either
have to be early finishing or mold
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant and likely to finish in most
places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the early finishers are my sour
strawberry, my blue cush.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mold resistant large yielders that
finished in time are boggle gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see boggle gum's got NL5 with the
bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like antifreeze from the great white
North and nothing stops that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lifesaver, which we haven't talked about,
very mold resistant large yielder,
[SPEAKER_01]: great outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sweet Sydney also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Lifesaver, the boggle gum and the
blue moon rocks and the sweet Sydney yield
[SPEAKER_01]: well finish in region reasonable time and
resist the mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's been true and it continues to be
true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all I can say is that I do my best not
to just keep inbreeding my seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but to do a rotation where I go back to an
earlier set of seeds that I saved in my
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder's seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I keep clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that, you know, at times you
have to reselect clones, but I've kept the
[SPEAKER_01]: same sour bubble clone the longest,
which is essential to all my sour strains
[SPEAKER_01]: and blue cush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely one of the more long held
ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, if we just touch on something
you mentioned a question or two ago about,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you said, you know, like it would
have been neat to know that sour diesel
[SPEAKER_03]: was going to be the big thing at the time,
but you know, there was other reasons why
[SPEAKER_03]: you didn't get into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just on that general line of thought,
what's your opinion on the general
[SPEAKER_03]: trending nature of strains?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you kind of keep an eye on what's on
the come up and would you ever try to be
[SPEAKER_03]: ahead of the curb, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, do you ever get the feeling that
maybe some bubblegum slash, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the kind of your flavors are on the rise
and would you try to anticipate that if
[SPEAKER_03]: so?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I may not be quite as up
to date on everything as I was back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day, but it does seem some of the work
that's being done with a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: Africans, you know, people are raving
about and that there may be some things
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, I'm not aware of and that
I haven't even tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're right about people giving me
seeds at samples and events that I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people who like remember me from
long ago and they see me and they know I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be there or whatever and they
bring seeds for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of other guys, you know,
startup companies, good growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, we definitely respect
some of the newer companies than us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that there are so many small
companies now that, you know, everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: seems to jump and wagon with the new
popular strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been a couple of times as temp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to me, Girl Scout Cookies is
pretty remarkably my type of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, it definitely got traces of pre ninety
eight bubble in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I love our bubble is in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, what was that last bit?
[SPEAKER_03]: You think maybe some sour bubbles in
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just mean that the pre ninety
eight bubble, I believe, is in the sour
[SPEAKER_01]: bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of the reason I love Girl
Scout Cookies, too, because I think I
[SPEAKER_01]: taste it in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, I've heard that comment a few
times as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while we're on the topic of,
you know, seed businesses and just that
[SPEAKER_03]: general nature, what's your opinion on
what some would describe as the rising
[SPEAKER_03]: nature of seed prices?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because some breeders have pointed out
that most people are relatively charging
[SPEAKER_03]: about the same thing if you compare the
prices while accounting for inflation to
[SPEAKER_03]: say companies in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, there's obviously a lot of clear
examples where there are people charging,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, quite large price tags
associated with their seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's obviously not proportional.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about this general idea?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, do you think there should be a
limit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it's just a capitalist thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it's like, you know, if someone wants
to pay, where do you sit on it?
Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: I always wanted to be competitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, I didn't want to be the
lowest or the highest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's important that you
provide a good value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if something's brand new and they
want to auction it off and they can get a
[SPEAKER_01]: high price for it, if something's really
good enough that people will pay their
[SPEAKER_01]: prices for it, you can't blame people for,
I mean, you know, business is business and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're probably going to charge what they
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that there's a little bit of
old school business morality that a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people could, and that is that you want
the customer to be satisfied.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want them to return and use your seeds
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more about returning customers than
trying to fish up a whole bunch of new
[SPEAKER_01]: guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like right now in states that have
gone here in the USA, anybody can grow
[SPEAKER_01]: four or five plants legally, and they
don't need any permits or anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, unless there's some local
ordinance that might prevent them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state law lets people grow a few
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems to me that there could be a
lot of new growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my seeds are easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell them which ones are the easiest.
[SPEAKER_01]: People usually, we recommend the boggle
gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it bulletproof.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it tastes like bubble gum,
but it's got the NL5 in it, which makes it
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant to almost everything,
every mistake you can make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll produce something even if you
forget to feed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we often tell people, you know,
it's really good for beginners,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not for beginners only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boggle gum was a medical strain,
and we didn't even call it that back at
[SPEAKER_01]: the time, but it was sold as such in
Canada online for $350 an ounce for a
[SPEAKER_01]: number of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know how they got away with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I went up to Vancouver,
I found places like the melting point
[SPEAKER_01]: where bubble man had his vaporizers all in
view and the open windows on the main
[SPEAKER_01]: street.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cops walking by had all my stuff out on
the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were all getting high up there many
years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just mentioned the NL5.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to ask you about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did you get yours from?
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you have any speculations on what
the genetics behind it are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably somebody who does know
the answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you where I got them.
[SPEAKER_01]: NL5, a BC company, a British Columbia seed
company, they sold not just Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: Lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was back before they just sold Northern
Lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did sell Northern Light 5 seeds,
which another guy obtained and transferred
[SPEAKER_01]: them to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had the name he had written on his
own tag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't get the package or anything,
but they were alleged to be NL5.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I grew them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were different than just Northern
Lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could say this, that it was pretty
excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant structure was exactly like a
Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had a lot of green, sort of like
menthol or greenness to its composition.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was good smoke, but not quite as
good as the Amsterdam bubble gum that I
[SPEAKER_01]: had grown and gotten from drunkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was rugged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hardy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did that cross because those were
the first two sets of imported seeds I had
[SPEAKER_01]: obtained.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also one which is still around.
[SPEAKER_03]: You still use it to this day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel that's because it's still
solid or it's more so because you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: still be able to offer those strains it
was used in the creation for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we pretty much for our own use grow
indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've lately just been growing three
of our strains from three clones that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got running.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, one's sour bubble,
one's the sour grape, and one is the blue
[SPEAKER_01]: moon rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were running more types,
but we're kind of downsizing on the pot
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and trying to just continue to
keep up on the seed growing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the three clones I have
selected and that we're growing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm growing from seeds and working on
the Bluetooth project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really, we've gotten most of the
work done on that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just doing our final roomful of
it to come out with the seeds later this
[SPEAKER_01]: fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something our viewers loved to always
hear from the guests is what are some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the traits you like to look for when
selecting a male?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, males have smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, with my strains,
it's not too hard for me to select males
[SPEAKER_01]: because I have a couple of tricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, yes, you have to reselect males.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the fact is that it's best
to go back to older seeds that you have
[SPEAKER_01]: than maybe the ones that you're also
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You find a male as close to back when it
was early as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I am not one to use just one
male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I suppose somebody thinks that's not
right, but I am not always trying to get
[SPEAKER_01]: them all to be as identical as clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've had strains get that way and
it gets a little boring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that it's fun when my sour
strawberry where you do have more than one
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype that you're going to get in a
pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may sound backwards as far as
stability, but I've got plenty of strains
[SPEAKER_01]: that are quite stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been making them for a long time and
being able to know what the right male is
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to look like and smell like
because I've done it so many times makes
[SPEAKER_01]: it easier for me to reselect males.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you subscribe to the idea of trying to
find a male, for example, which may be as
[SPEAKER_03]: closely as possible mirrors a female of
the same strain?
[SPEAKER_03]: That you find very desirable?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think there's some intrinsic
differences, which means you can't just
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily do what I mentioned?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like every one of my strains wasn't made
the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't like to go into every detail
about it, but let me explain with the sour
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a clone, want to produce
seeds like that clone, I'm not,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not one to feminize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feminize seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've never sold feminize seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a story for you about feminizing
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I did do it at one time, but,
uh, well, the reason I don't do it is
[SPEAKER_01]: because you feminize seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be fine possibly for the next
generation, but if they use those seeds to
[SPEAKER_01]: make more seeds, the hermaphrodite
tendencies definitely come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I expected that people would take
my seeds and probably make some more seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: of their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least when I started this company,
it's more the way it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: than, than people are just going to buy
loads of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So given you've had some clients for,
you know, 15 plus years, I'd love to get
[SPEAKER_03]: your opinion on this topic of genetic
drift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you believe that over time females and
maybe even males for that matter can
[SPEAKER_03]: deteriorate in quality or do you feel that
for the most part, you know, the same plan
[SPEAKER_03]: is the same plan?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that the genetics doesn't
change, but that a clone, the quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: its bud and, uh, numbers on its GHC and
stuff definitely can decline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there it's not because of genetic
alteration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not that easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I don't think the plant
would be healthy if that was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the genetics of clones are pretty
solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but I do think that the process of
selection is one thing, uh, even with
[SPEAKER_01]: clones and that a line can deteriorate
over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think my sour bubble clone,
you know, being like 17 years old,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I could get it to test out
as high as when it was brand new,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I saw it come down some and I
still want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, they, there are theories of ways
to take a clone that's sort of run down
[SPEAKER_01]: and refurbish it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only one I've ever really heard is
to take it outside for a summer and let
[SPEAKER_01]: it, let it live like a real tree,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you think that there is a poster
child in regards to all the strains you've
[SPEAKER_03]: made that represent bog seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, is there one strain which you think
really embodies bog seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, it's either the original bubble
gum bog bubble or sour bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bog bubble was a flagship and the sour
bubble kind of became the new leader and
[SPEAKER_01]: all the strains got bred to the sour
bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a similar story to one that
Soma told after years of all his strains
[SPEAKER_01]: being developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He finally had this one male that he
decided was so good that he had to cross
[SPEAKER_01]: that to all his strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he came out with a whole second set of
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing I wanted to go back to for a
second, what I didn't really answer was
[SPEAKER_01]: like the type of breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I mentioned that with the trying
to make seeds from a clone that I got,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got off the train track onto why I don't
feminize.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by finding that perfect match,
like I did for the sour bubble,
[SPEAKER_01]: that really was important to getting those
first seeds from the clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that that, you know, was the main
thing in the breeding project that
[SPEAKER_01]: mattered the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: The different batches and the numbers of
back crosses, the further you get away
[SPEAKER_01]: from the clone, the better they would
yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I think at a certain point,
like back cross for you wouldn't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: go any further away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would go back and start over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with a lot of my strains, I don't
think that, you know, any breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: project, when you start it, you really
don't know what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's kind of a crap shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always told people to follow their
intuition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to know what they're hoping for,
and wish for that, and that it could make
[SPEAKER_01]: it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a spiritual power that we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so do you think that there's something
more to breeding than just purely a,
[SPEAKER_03]: say, criteria of things you're looking
for?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there kind of a certain amount of
intuition involved also?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm that type of person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm that type of breeder, like Soma,
who, you know, is kind of a believer in a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of things, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of junk, spiritualism and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned to you about my New World
Order thread and how, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: conspiracy theories and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I worked in medicine for a number of
years, and I then went to alternative
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine for a while, like a naturopathic
therapist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of believe in the power that
people have to help each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in massage, for example, the human
touch is what people crave and is
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyway, you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's something called intention and
attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if your intention were to make pain
go away in his lower body, lower back or
[SPEAKER_01]: neck, for example, and you paid attention
to that by concentrating on it and working
[SPEAKER_01]: on it and massaging it or whatever you do,
manipulating it, that because of your
[SPEAKER_01]: intent and attention, that is your
spiritual power and that that person can
[SPEAKER_01]: feel it, can benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are creative and it's not all science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I love science and I wish I knew more
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's the thing I like to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a science fiction fan,
you know, I just love space and rockets
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't dis science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was good at science and I liked biology
and science like that, but I didn't have a
[SPEAKER_01]: degree in genetics or even agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was like political science.
[SPEAKER_01]: English law and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regular old college program that
eventually, you know, I ended up having my
[SPEAKER_01]: first child at 21 years old and leaving my
first session in college early to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I ended up going back to school and
stuff, but that's a whole nother story.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you touched on science there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like to engage in the new emerging
technology and sciences that are kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: touted to help breeders?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for example, do you use any of,
not just like, you know, an analytical lab
[SPEAKER_03]: testing for cannabinoid values,
but like maybe the ones where they help
[SPEAKER_03]: you to detect males earlier on or things
like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I never use those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I am not saying that testing isn't
valid or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had plenty of tests on plenty of
our strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, my, my weed, different
kinds been sold in California by
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times they would,
they would send a sample in and get it
[SPEAKER_01]: tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to pay for testing,
but the kind of testing I really believe
[SPEAKER_01]: in being with the medical background is
more like clinical testing and that would
[SPEAKER_01]: be the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that that's anecdotal and
harder to nail down than that the THC
[SPEAKER_01]: content or the CBNA or whatever else new
component.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand a little bit about THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand enough about it to know that
I like my strains, high THC with a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of CBD and that Indica-sided strains
like that, like my sour bubble,
[SPEAKER_01]: kill my pain the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are a bit on the couch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Side for some people, but it stimulates my
brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I got, I got pretty high on it before
we did this session.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not like I'm sleepy or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've only had a sip of coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, do you consider yourself to have a
high tolerance or more just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, cause it's for a medical need,
it helps to counteract the maybe sedative
[SPEAKER_03]: side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other people experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people would say we have a high
tolerance because my wife and I smoke a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the truth is that you could get a
higher tolerance by using more edibles and
[SPEAKER_01]: we do eat edible now and then,
but not that regular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you get a high content
using concentrates and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we make bubble hash and sometimes
we'll add a little of that to our joint if
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to pep it up, you know,
but I wouldn't say that we could take all
[SPEAKER_01]: that much at any one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, we're older.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some highs that are too busy
for me that I don't even like that are
[SPEAKER_01]: like, really, really sativa sided strain
sometimes that, you know, it just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it makes me a little anxious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of prefer the, the Indica high.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That segues perfectly into my next
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where I was going to say that a lot of
your strains tend to have this commonality
[SPEAKER_03]: of a relatively short flowering time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously that lends itself more
towards the Indica side of genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was this intentional or is it just kind of
how things worked out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was intentional being an indoor
grower myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I actually came up with my own
cell for a plant, a strain that I call
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rating scale rather than the smokers
rating scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like growers, they're the ones that
have to work with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I like a strain that finishes in like
seven and a half, eight and a half weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's long enough to get a pretty darn
good yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I do have two or three,
I think longer to finish like indoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: my LSD and my life star, they both take at
least 10, maybe 11 weeks indoors and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're a little late finishing outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the LSD is quite mold resistant and
the life star probably should be too,
[SPEAKER_01]: although I'm really, really not sure on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I, you know, being an indoor
grower, I want things to move along,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and I, I, I do what's called,
you know, continuous production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I called it bonanza green.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I wrote my book back in the day,
it described how we keep the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: moving, you know, from a bedroom to a
flowering room and on down the line in the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering room till they reach the end of
the room and where they get sort of set
[SPEAKER_01]: aside from the lights for a couple more
days where they can still see the light,
[SPEAKER_01]: but finish up and could sort of get the
most out of the room that way is more
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the grower's scale would involve
the amount of energy required to get how
[SPEAKER_01]: much yield back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so fewer weeks of flowering definitely
would be a factor in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were looking at it commercially
too, that, you know, there's some great
[SPEAKER_01]: long flowering strains, but unless the
yields are going to be really big,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want that indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing is if, if the yields
are really big and they take a long time,
[SPEAKER_01]: then the plants still more susceptible to
problems than it will fast flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, like, you know, mold or bugs or
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some people may not have been aware of
what you just referenced, but you have
[SPEAKER_03]: written your own book called Bonanza of
Green.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was going to ask you about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What inspired you to write it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it kind of the case that you set out
to write the book or was it more that you
[SPEAKER_03]: were giving out all this info and just
over time you were kind of like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I've got like a book's worth of stuff
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kept writing the same shit over and
over again, you know, and I really got to
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking we ought to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, my, my wife was working
at the time, but I was off work and it
[SPEAKER_01]: could have never got done without her
help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're both literate and all,
but she's, you know, more perfectionistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she made sure that the paragraphs made
sense to everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: My book was meant to be simple and to
entice people into growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also to show them pictures of my
strains in the back of the book and
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend that they get seeds from us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, part of it was a promotional
thing for my seeds, but it never turned
[SPEAKER_01]: out to be that big a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got a thousand copies printed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since then we've just been burning
them on CDs and sending them to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was on the Google play for
some time and it may still be out there
[SPEAKER_01]: online.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Bonanza green by bushy old grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to ask you this one question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know how to slot it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just going to do it here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Life saver your cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an interesting one to me because on
face value from what I can see,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's one of the only ones where it's made
using two different breeders genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you ever consider doing that again?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or was that kind of a one-off special
thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I would consider doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, and that was a time when I used
some coolest genetics and I'll give him
[SPEAKER_01]: all the credit in the world for his JCB
Jack's cleaner blueberry, incredibly fast
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering strain and very good bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it was good enough that I
wanted to cross it to my bubble gum,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was very fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the original bog bubble,
it was probably faster finishing than it
[SPEAKER_01]: is now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was a difference in the way I
grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, we were getting it to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: In like, you know, seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so his, he had some, if he knows he
claimed even finished in like 42 days,
[SPEAKER_01]: 43 days or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's like too fast,
but they were fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were at least as fast as my bog
bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did cross those together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, I've been talking to
James at Seeds here now about possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: using some pollen from a very well-known
breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to mention the name until we
actually go forward with the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this point, I've said that,
you know, I might take some select pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: to work with on my strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, that'd be interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I might know who you're
talking about, but we'll leave that to be
[SPEAKER_03]: seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I did want to ask though is,
I don't know if you're aware, but there's
[SPEAKER_03]: a few people in the scene who are very
reminiscent about the strain bubbleberry
[SPEAKER_03]: that was offered by Saga Martha Seeds many
years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I noticed that you essentially offer,
you know, a very similar version to that
[SPEAKER_03]: strain, like a blueberry cross to a
bubblegum type of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever noticed this similarity and
thought maybe I should try to work this a
[SPEAKER_03]: bit more?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I am aware of his strain by name and
I never actually tried it or worked with
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but I did have some friends in
Amsterdam that told me that his
[SPEAKER_01]: bubbleberry was excellent tasting.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, well, there's several company of
bubblegum blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was not intended to copy him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was done probably pretty much at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think we used exactly the same
components or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course they're related.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, of course they both have
bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they both have blueberry in them,
but he and I didn't work together on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't take his genetics and use them
and he didn't take mine and use mine,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think either.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one question I love to ask the guests,
because our viewers always love to hear it
[SPEAKER_03]: is, do you have any tips for phenohunting?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what I mean by that is,
do you, for example, maybe prefer to run a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of plants in small pots and just see
how they go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you like to let them get big to get
a true test of them?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your method when you're going to
pop some seeds and try to determine what's
[SPEAKER_03]: worth keeping?
[SPEAKER_01]: What a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm always doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is right now, you know,
like I was telling you, my sour bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: clone, great for breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely the genetics are still just
popping.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we decided to, again, look for another
select sour bubble mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went through a group of them a
while back.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I don't do a big group at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might only be like 15 plants,
and a few of them are going to turn out to
[SPEAKER_01]: be males.
[SPEAKER_01]: With my sour bubble, the strain is about
70 percent female, maybe 65.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now I'm doing it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last time I had a couple of
promising keepers and another guy just
[SPEAKER_01]: showed his keeper from sour bubble that he
selected on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the bubble gum version of sour
bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not an uncommon one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's super delicious and sticky and
frosty and finishes real fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one I had wasn't a very big
yielder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't think it was quite as strong
as, you know, the other phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then there was another one that I also
thought was a possible keeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it didn't have the same taste that I
was looking for, but it was really strong
[SPEAKER_01]: and had an interesting taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we just wasn't sure it was good
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're doing another look right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the way I do it is I this time I had
a set of sour bubble seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to go ahead and check out some of
the ones that looked marginal,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually, small and marginal, and that I
probably wouldn't have sold anyhow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was funny, all germinated,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, well, let's just see how
they grow, you know, and if they're brunts
[SPEAKER_01]: or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess out of the bunch, we might
have had a couple that died off or were
[SPEAKER_01]: weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've got a group of plants now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There must be about 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we do is we number them all and
we clone them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we keep the clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, often the males,
because, you know, usually they just die,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, you can clone a male, but it's
hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after we find out which ones are
the females, we go ahead and flower out
[SPEAKER_01]: the big plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, I got a limited size indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just trying to, you know,
do everything in sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it can't be all that many at all
one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I get those into flower,
which is really soon, they're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just, you know, finish them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll try the different kinds of bud and
we'll write up, you know, what I thought
[SPEAKER_01]: about each phenotype and see if there's
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like at this point, everybody wants
something that's a good yielder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Sour Bubble is just a moderate
yielder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a great yielder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown big plants, you know,
to show that it's possible, but it takes a
[SPEAKER_01]: wild veggie net and then they flower fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tend to not be the biggest yielders.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to find one that's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has similar taste to my old clone that
yields more and has higher content like
[SPEAKER_01]: the old clone did originally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like the dream combo.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is going to be, a bit of an
interesting question because I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_03]: on the timeline, but how do you feel about
what it appears to be to me, the fact that
[SPEAKER_03]: like Barney's farm stole the LSD name from
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I didn't look at it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the truth is when I named LSD,
Hey, here's something RezDog had something
[SPEAKER_01]: to do with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Name NSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about it and I says,
what am I going to call this shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, it's lifesaver.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crossed with so much diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, huh, let me see LSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he actually came up with a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went like, duh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did name it LSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do think it was after my LSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably a couple of years later,
Lee, the Barney's farm came out with their
[SPEAKER_01]: LSD, but do we know that they were even
aware that there was another LSD and did
[SPEAKER_01]: they claim it was bog LSD?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And did it have the same components?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And did they tell what the components
were?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even if the strains are,
they came from different origins.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they just knocked off my LSD
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they made their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came up with their own name from the
same abbreviation system of like leavened
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk diesel or whatever's in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you think though that there should
be some sort of standard by which if a
[SPEAKER_03]: name already exists, there's some rules
you should follow?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think it's fine so long as you
state what it is and so if people look
[SPEAKER_03]: into the details, they'll be able to see
that it's different?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's fine as long as you're not
dishonest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's awful to not give somebody
the credit they deserve if you lose their
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's awful to try to steal
somebody's strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to names, look,
there's a bunch of sour grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not so sure that mine was the first
sour grape.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sure didn't know of another one,
but the past one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is, mine is bog sour grape and I
can tell you what's in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have told everybody what's in it and
it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the only reason that I can
remember anything is because I always tell
[SPEAKER_01]: the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I did lie to make it look better or
sound cooler or something, I could never
[SPEAKER_01]: keep all the lies straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm an old guy and a lot of the
stuff you're asking me to remember was 15
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago or more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to put you under the pressure like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, I've enjoyed it just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying that I'm an old stoner and
in my memories, the worst things are the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual names of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did meet a lot of the big readers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I did go to Amsterdam a few
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I traveled with Gypsy and his Jaguar in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I drove his Jaguar, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went 156 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a nice big car.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, that was so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, cruising the Autobahn and stuff,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were down in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went to Breeder Steve's Greenhouses and
stuff just before he got up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was worried that us being in the
pictures that were shown could have led to
[SPEAKER_01]: him getting in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, wow, man, we were all
pretty careless.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, wow, that sounds very much like the
heyday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I mean, it was like when I
first got into this business with Gypsy,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I mean, he was the one that
asked me to make seeds for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had put up a picture of this
bubblegum because he knew I grew
[SPEAKER_01]: bubblegum, you know, and he had had a wind
free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can tell me what this strain was in
the picture showed how it was all
[SPEAKER_01]: popcorned out, the bud, the way bubblegum
should look when it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I right away said, well, it looks like
bubblegum to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, oh, yeah, you win,
boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You you definitely get the the pack of
bubblegum seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got another pack of bubblegum seeds
and they were signed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I grew those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they were a lot different
than than my bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they tasted and smelled like
bubblegum, too, but a little bit more like
[SPEAKER_01]: cotton candy to me than my bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also thought that while it was a
large plant and everything, it was awfully
[SPEAKER_01]: woody, like it was more wooden tree than
it was bud, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, phenotypes vary a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows how many I had to work with,
just one pack, I think, of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard people comment about that,
about how I think there's kind of a more
[SPEAKER_03]: indica leaning bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Simon's may have been the more
sativa leaning one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it was more sativa or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely had this woody and stout
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely was, you know, a pretty good
size plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I thought it was just as indica sided,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I could be off with that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, while talking about you having
your little holiday in Europe,
[SPEAKER_03]: is the European market something you want
to explore more or are you just already
[SPEAKER_03]: too busy trying to keep up with domestic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've been limited in our ability to
stay like distributing to to distributors
[SPEAKER_01]: in other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: After, you know, some problems that RezDog
had, we decided to go domestic for a
[SPEAKER_01]: while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're entertaining the notions of
certain countries that allow it,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we are, you know, talking to people,
some people interested in having
[SPEAKER_01]: distributorships.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so far, right now, I do have
distributors who will ship anywhere in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world or just about anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're based in the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyone can get them if you're
wondering.
[SPEAKER_03]: All my Australian friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Inevitably, I get that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would also like people to know if
they want information about who my
[SPEAKER_01]: distributors are and where they can be
found and reached, that they can always
[SPEAKER_01]: check out Bog or Bogseeds at Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I'm willing to email address if you
would allow that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we can give information on obtaining
seeds, depending on where you are at
[SPEAKER_01]: Bogland, B-O-G-L-A-N-D 72 at gmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, you can get them from Seeds
here now, one of our favorite sponsors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds here now is our largest distributor,
and they have done a great job for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can be assured that if you deal
with them, you'll be satisfied.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be getting the best service around.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sorry, just to jump back to the
question I was going to ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a legal question here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a bit of an interesting one,
but I want to hear your opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you see the future of cannabis
going in California?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because obviously, that's what you're
probably more familiar with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you think that the world will
follow California's suit?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, Eddie Lepp is a good friend of
mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a cannabis activist out here,
as am I.
[SPEAKER_01]: In California, we had the longest running
medical marijuana system of any state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ran it for like 15 years with no
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe me, a cottage industry,
people could take their half a pound or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever to a local dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be paid for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could go home and they could afford
to have a roof over their head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalization, well, we've always all
wanted legalization, but we want sanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: This kind of legalization is just
regulating it far too much, taxing it far
[SPEAKER_01]: too much, with no exceptions for medical
users, senior citizens, or people that
[SPEAKER_01]: want to grow, be limited like four plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this isn't going to stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eddie Lepp and I and a lot of other people
involved in the medical industry out here
[SPEAKER_01]: are furious with the fact that they lied
about the promises that our medical rights
[SPEAKER_01]: would not be lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe not for a year or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they are threatened and we are
working on ballot initiatives to get our
[SPEAKER_01]: medical rights protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And listen, I'm naturopathic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm into health and I believe in medicine
and doctors and all that, but I believe in
[SPEAKER_01]: the personal right of a person to grow
herbs for their own use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean any plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't care what plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact is that if it's for your own use
and you're not even selling it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's nobody's business but your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of people that think
it's healthier than a lot of the medicines
[SPEAKER_01]: that people use.
[SPEAKER_01]: For God's sakes, the pharmaceuticals that
got everybody addicted on opiates,
[SPEAKER_01]: if people were growing their own opium
poppies and bleeding them and putting that
[SPEAKER_01]: on their weed and smoking it, they
wouldn't even get addicted to it because
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be at such a low level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not in its natural form.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's why I like raw cannabis
much better than concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know raw cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fresh produce and it doesn't last
forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got a lot of it and we need to turn
a lot of it into concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I like is fresh cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I honestly think that it's healthy and
maybe it's healthier to vape than to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke, but I still smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: After all these years of my wife and I
smoking all kinds of marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: it hasn't harmed us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kept us from getting cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked cigarettes for years and I had a
heart bypass operation 25 years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: but cannabis has kept me alive since then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: What an incredible testimony.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, what legal
changes do you think need to occur to
[SPEAKER_03]: facilitate a more productive cannabis
industry and just culture?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, to tell you the truth, I agree with
Governor Brown and the governor of
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado and a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: This may sound crazy to you, but I was not
for this legalization proposition and a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people in Oregon and Ohio.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the horrible thing they set up
in Ohio where just five farms would have a
[SPEAKER_01]: monopoly growing all the weed in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the voters voted it down, just like
California voted legalization down the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they voted it down because it was all
commercialistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all about taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only reason they're doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I don't begrudge a
recreational system.
[SPEAKER_01]: There can be a recreational system of
legal weed and there can also be the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana system where people
don't have to work in the same fashion and
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't have to be taxed so heavily.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so do you think that that is a
potential for California to go back to
[SPEAKER_03]: like the formal model or do you think
you've almost come too far?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, to tell you the truth, I don't know
what the future will bring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that a nationwide medical
marijuana system would make more sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I understand they just think
everything commercially in the business
[SPEAKER_01]: world like making fewer producers to make
sure you're able to collect all your
[SPEAKER_01]: taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we could have made sure that all
the all the was safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there could have been a system set up
that wouldn't have preserved the cottage
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to create and is creating a
disaster in the states where they took
[SPEAKER_01]: away the medical marijuana and put it in
effect legal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing's happening in Canada right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a whole country, you know,
they just legalized it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of the seed companies that I
sell seeds to up in Canada just informed
[SPEAKER_01]: us that she's not allowed to sell seeds
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how is that legalization,
man?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, one step forward, three steps back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's exactly what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was just fine in California
with the medical system that we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't hear anybody complaining,
you know, but commercial interests,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's like the politicians didn't
want to pass a bill to legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they do, you can't change a ballot
initiative in California in Congress
[SPEAKER_01]: without having like a two thirds vote in
both house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they got another ballot initiative up
and made it look like this was going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: good, you know, and all people can buy now
is a lesser grade of marijuana at a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they have to go back underground to the
black market to get good weed at a
[SPEAKER_01]: reasonable price from one of their
friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just as a bit of a change of pace,
because that's all the legal questions we
[SPEAKER_03]: had.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a question here that was
submitted by one of our Patreon viewers.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I'm actually not that familiar
with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping you're just going to be able
to take the reins and answer this one
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is, what are the common
mistakes you see people making when
[SPEAKER_03]: they're making water hash at home or bowl
hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK, I love bowl hash and I still make
that all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just getting ready to make a whole
a whole bunch of it to put away in store
[SPEAKER_01]: for myself right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't even have any plans of selling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you how I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, you know, a bubble man is a
friend of mine from back in the days of
[SPEAKER_01]: either overgrow or icy mag whenever he
came out with his bags and he out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was one of the first guys that he wanted
to send a free set of three bags to
[SPEAKER_01]: because he knew I'd make the hash and how
many followers I had at the overgrow or
[SPEAKER_01]: icy mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I appreciated that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I read his thread about how you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I pretty much followed his directions
and found that my different strains
[SPEAKER_01]: produced the different hashes and that for
a while, you know, we were mostly making
[SPEAKER_01]: bog bubble hash and then switched over to
making sour bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turned out we did get that tested and it
did turn out to be pretty darn good for
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way I made it wasn't all that
special, but it was it was nearly 60
[SPEAKER_01]: percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still is nearly 60 percent THC and not too
much CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it comes out really dark, like a
really dark red to black.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really like the hash that comes from
the sour bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my process is pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I really think that it's
not necessary to use a whole large number
[SPEAKER_01]: of bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just use two bags and three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the mistakes people make is
is taking out and separating away from the
[SPEAKER_01]: hash resins that are in the like 120
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, like I mix and strain my weed in a 220
and then that bag goes into a 160 and I do
[SPEAKER_01]: a second strain with the 160.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just catch it all in a 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, unless your strain is really high
quality and your trim is just sugar leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: like I use really to upgrade trim,
this won't work for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works for me and sour bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it does to improve the hash is
the larger stuff like the 130 140 that
[SPEAKER_01]: gets through the 160 bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of flavor in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what people are realizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just going ahead, separating that
out, using it in their edibles or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, because it's lighter weight
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a lot of them collect in the 73,
which is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But believe me, there's stuff going
through the 73 that's also good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you catch it all in the 45 from the
160 to the 45 and it's really high quality
[SPEAKER_01]: trim that you put in there, then you can
get a good amount of a more flavorful
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, the thing about bubble hash is you
don't want them to all be the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I find sometimes a lot of
concentrates is hash gets to be hash,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, more flavor, like if you've smoked
the old conventional hashes and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: how good they taste, like these fingers,
like good Moroccan or good red Lebanese or
[SPEAKER_01]: blonde Lebanese, these connections weren't
as strong as the bubble hashes we make now
[SPEAKER_01]: by any means, but they were delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, to me, that's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't often agree with everything that
DJ Short says.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so one time he was talking,
I was listening, I know him slightly,
[SPEAKER_01]: about how people are trying to just jack
up and get these highest potency strains
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's like adding neutral spirits to
fine wine or something, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I see his point, you know,
but my sour bubble is really strong and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't think there's a problem
with them having good power.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on to the last question before we do
our last little quick fire ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've kind of already touched on this,
but just to get a clarification,
[SPEAKER_03]: where do you sit on the issue of people
breeding with your work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Specifically, do you like it if someone
comes to you and says, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, I've got this thing I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that OK?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you kind of think like there's no
owners for them to contact you and ask for
[SPEAKER_03]: permission or anything like where do you
sit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I like it when a person shows me the
respect to ask permission, but I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: expect that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the truth is when I sell
you my seeds, you've bought them and you
[SPEAKER_01]: own them and you can do what you please
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you actually make seeds my seeds,
I hope that it will at least be a cross
[SPEAKER_01]: with something else and not just a
knockoff of my strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they wouldn't just make a knockoff of
my strain and call it exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wouldn't mind if you made a strain
and then you told what was truthfully in
[SPEAKER_01]: it and gave me a little credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's good enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, because, you know, I'm I'm
actually more a part of the past of this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry than I am the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know what I'd like to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'd like to see is that everybody
contributing and coming up with new stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: on their own like back in the day,
having so much fun doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a great sentiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on to our last little few questions,
I call them the quick fire section.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's jump into it was just five quick
little questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is your favorite strain that you
think has got a bit of a bad rap?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking I'll tell you, I do think
that sometimes bubble gum doesn't get the
[SPEAKER_01]: rap it deserves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, maybe you think it never got a bad
rap.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the truth is, I remember things like,
you know, it's kind of inconsistent or or
[SPEAKER_01]: runs or mutants or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't ever remember any of my seeds
being that way, that they were always
[SPEAKER_01]: hearty and healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other complaints that it really wasn't
very strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, well, I remember I had people
say to me, why do you like to grow bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: gum?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, it's really not that
strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it seems strong to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's got the indica high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very relaxing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I I'm not so sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know many strains that have gotten such
a bad rap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want any negativity at any other
strains from any other breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm a really nice guy and I
wouldn't want to point out, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: some bad work that some other reader did.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just answer the next question,
which is going to be what is the your
[SPEAKER_03]: least favorite strain?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, you know, it doesn't have to be
something from someone else could just be
[SPEAKER_03]: a general thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you might.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, to tell you the truth, even though I
recognize how strong it is and how good
[SPEAKER_01]: there are, I really don't like that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most sour diesels are too fuely for me and
I won't smoke them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked one so strong one time it
practically put me down on my knees.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I know how strong it can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the Ken Dog stuff, I really don't
like the taste and no, I like train wreck
[SPEAKER_01]: and people got sick of the taste of that
and maybe it got a bad rep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But train wreck is a great old strain that
I would still consider working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, maybe we need that because no
one is working with it really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the truth is that it has a great
painkilling effect and I like that taste,
[SPEAKER_01]: but people get sick of the taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, of my strains, like one of
the best tasting ones that has like a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of nose and flavor is the Blue Moon Rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I love this stuff, but I couldn't just
smoke it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like after a while, you definitely
want something else because it's just so
[SPEAKER_01]: strong of kind of blueberry taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, that sounds like what I
needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the Blue Kush yields a little
less, but it's even stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both related and didn't talk about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Blue Moon Rocks is one of my old
strains that it was an old clone Blue Moon
[SPEAKER_01]: and that had a blueberry in it that wasn't
DJ's.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Vic's Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it makes my Blue Moon Rocks
considerably different blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as dark purple as DJ's,
but yields real well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might need to take a little
investigation into that one myself by the
[SPEAKER_03]: sounds of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the Blue Moon clone was me either by
one or two guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not sure if those seeds were given
to me by Subcool, but I had a friend in
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida named Tommy and I think he sent me
the seeds and he told me that the Blue
[SPEAKER_01]: Moon was a cross of this Vic's Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember Vic from back in the
overgrow times and the canopy Moonbeam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there was a Blue Moonshine
that came out after Blue Moon,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was probably Blue Moon crossed with
something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyhow, I got the seeds of the Blue
Moon and I didn't want to change it that
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that would be my bubble berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact is that I kept it more like
the Blue Moon than bringing it to my
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble gum side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So next question is desert island
situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can only take two strains with you to
this desert island.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have unlimited amounts of it,
but you can only pick two strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which two?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Sour Bubble would definitely be one
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several others that I really like
a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's really fun to grow the
strawberry and the Sour Grape is of nearly
[SPEAKER_01]: comparable quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those three, the Sour Bubble, the Sour
Grape, and the Strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wanted to mention Sour Boggle
because, you know, my Boggle gum was one
[SPEAKER_01]: of my original strains that we crossed to
the Sour Bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Sour Boggle came out surprising
results in that it's very bubble gummy
[SPEAKER_01]: flavored.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very up daytime high, unlike most of
the mostly bubble gum flavored ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's got a taste that
there's something besides the bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I kind of call it a champagne bubble
gum for some reason, kind of like a gold
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be the other one,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got you two, Bog Bubble and the
Sour Bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Sour Bubble and the Sour Boggle,
which is Sour Boggle gum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is one of my favorite questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could go back to any point in time
and history, as well as anywhere in the
[SPEAKER_03]: world, to presumably collect some
land-raised seeds, where would you go and
[SPEAKER_03]: what period?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, land-raised seeds working with
them, it's definitely like would be very
[SPEAKER_01]: rewarding, you know, to say, this is,
you know, the Congo Bongo, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is what they grew there for hundreds
of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you worked with it and you,
you know, bred and selected until you got
[SPEAKER_01]: it even more potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most of the land-raised strains
really start out not being all that great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not sure, but it seems to me that
it would have been a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would be thinking Asia, you know,
like, you know, one of the things maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: mountainous regions were, you know,
the fast-flowering cushions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like like in India, where the
Hindu religion, do you know that when they
[SPEAKER_01]: were their students in religion and
spirituality, that they would drink Bang,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was a mild cannabis beverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: To make them more astute, more able to
learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe an Indian strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's certainly one that's not explored
much currently, the Indian genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, it's just that they have an
ancient history of cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am kind of a history buff,
but most kind of history buff that I study
[SPEAKER_01]: is like ancient aliens and stuff,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen that there's like pyramids
all over the world and there's pyramids on
[SPEAKER_01]: the moon and there's pyramids on Mars and
out in the asteroid belt, there's a dwarf
[SPEAKER_01]: planet called Sirius.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they show pictures of one of our
probes went out through the asteroid belt
[SPEAKER_01]: and took pictures of this planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a six mile high pyramid on
Sirius, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: All I can say is I'm so happy you just
said all of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I tell you, the aliens are out
there, man, and they're already here too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact is that I don't really trust
them, but they have telepathy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can look just like regular people and
I don't trust them, but they seem nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to just shine the spotlight on
someone, name and shame someone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I can tell you, you know,
like I actually had experiences that are
[SPEAKER_01]: real, not just made up mythical stuff
about bog living in a cave or anything
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, but that when I was just seven
years old and I was in a Kresge store in
[SPEAKER_01]: Birmingham, Michigan, my mom let me go to
look at the toy section while she was
[SPEAKER_01]: shopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was the usual thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm walking down the aisle and here a
man in a business suit is facing me down
[SPEAKER_01]: the aisle like 15 feet away from me and
has telepathy to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have an eye contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear to God.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I'm from another planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, there's a million of us here
and we're here to help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he walked right on by and mouth
dropped open and I told my family about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they knew that I didn't make up
stories when I was a little kid or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when my wife and I were first
married, it was 1974.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd been married a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were in central Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one summer where we saw a bunch
of UFOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I had other people at my house
see them too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my family, my parents, my sister,
her husband, her kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: The darn things were flying around and
they were triangular, most of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one night, my wife and I,
just alone, and we had taken some shrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could say, wow, you were just
tripping.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we didn't see shit like this when we
took shrooms, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw something come down and land on the
road in front of our neighbor's house,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is like a quarter mile away,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this wasn't triangular and it landed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looked kind of like a bus,
like a short bus or something or a
[SPEAKER_01]: shuttlecraft from the Starship Enterprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it landed on the road, I guess,
facing away from us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got binoculars, we're up in our yard
and I'm looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing rotated like an army tank in
the road and a hole opened up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had sort of a hood on the front that
stuck out and a hatch opened up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wound up on the front of its hood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to pull the binoculars away real
quick as a giant light, a bright arc light
[SPEAKER_01]: came up through the hole in the front of
that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after it turned on this huge bright
light, it was the craziest thing you ever
[SPEAKER_01]: saw, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear to God, it's the whole truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife and I, there was a large field,
a pity corner from our house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're out at a farm in the country on dirt
road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this large field across from the
neighbor's house, it went out in that
[SPEAKER_01]: field and it skimmed it like an air
cushion vehicle or like something that
[SPEAKER_01]: could have been making a circle,
zipping around the field back and forth so
[SPEAKER_01]: fast that it looked like a cartoon,
like it couldn't be real or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the thing actually went down to
the river, a creek anyhow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's turned off its light and it sat
on the ground in the river there for
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly a half an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while it was on the ground,
it had little remote entry vehicles
[SPEAKER_01]: marching back and forth to a corner right
over us basically on its perimeter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after it was there for about a half an
hour, it took off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was the strangest part,
you know, the other ones, they were always
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty quiet, you know, nothing but a low
hum.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, when it took off the ground,
it was going straight up slowly and the
[SPEAKER_01]: lights were revolving around each other
and it had a whine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a whining sound, noise building up
like we'd never heard from one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it reached a certain altitude and the
red lights were spinning real fast and the
[SPEAKER_01]: whining was real loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden it shot at an angle
really high, like for orbit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took off so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear it would have killed a human.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sent three shock waves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It almost broke my front window.
[SPEAKER_01]: It buckled in and out three times and
later did break in a storm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that thing shot across the sky at the
highest angle like a jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going up and then just disappeared.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that's my story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was full on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't think you can make that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe me, I wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know how crazy it sounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even admit that we took a couple of
shrooms that night, but maybe it somehow
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed us to see something that we
normally wouldn't have seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the next day I went and looked around
out that field on a dirt bike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, did it knock down a fence or
anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it make any marks in the weeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no trace of anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might have been an encounter of the
second kind because it did make my window
[SPEAKER_01]: bounce in and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the shock wave hit us in the chest
like an air cannon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's what it felt like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It broke the sound barrier instantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we've probably get stuck on
this all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we should jump back to the last
question.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our absolute last question.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could recommend one bog strain to
anyone out there, regardless of their
[SPEAKER_03]: skill level, their experience,
all that, what would it be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess I would say it would be
boggle gum because I want them to be
[SPEAKER_01]: successful if they're novices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them to have a nice yielding good
product that would they would probably be
[SPEAKER_01]: happy to grow if they're not novices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it is exemplary of our
strains because it does very much have the
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble gum taste that I love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also is easy for anybody to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a great answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So brings us to about the end of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have any comments or shout outs
you wanted to make at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I didn't really plan on talking
about the aliens or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if I was crazy,
I'd still be seeing them and I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm pretty sure they're still around,
but I'm not trying to say I know what
[SPEAKER_01]: their agenda is or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm kind of a Buddhist Christian
and I'm just a believer in the golden
[SPEAKER_01]: rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really don't believe in in
accumulating wealth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've lived pretty well all my
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a pretty lucky kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that I've had the love of a
good woman for 48 years and that until one
[SPEAKER_01]: of us dies, we'll still have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we shared our marijuana
every day that we could.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, almost every day all those years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to say that it's been a
sacrament for us that it's it's been a
[SPEAKER_01]: right that we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Soma says the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's daily sacrament.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's the way we look at
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like it's not like I really want
to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blasted all the time, and it's not like I
really have to get high, but we get up in
[SPEAKER_01]: the morning and after a while,
you know, drinking some coffee and
[SPEAKER_01]: watching TV when we do smoke some that it
does open our minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the good thing about cannabis is that
it does stimulate creative thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the biggest miracle of cannabis is it
will allow you to forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's hard to forget the
things that are worrying you, the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that are bothering you.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people feel depressed a lot of
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A number of my strains are very
antidepressant in effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think it's a phony thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, honestly, we use medicines all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's more like aromatherapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a really small amount of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can be enough to completely change
someone's frame of mind, because believe
[SPEAKER_01]: me, that's an internal thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you're happy or not, look in the
mirror.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you smile at yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give yourself a big smile?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know that you'll feel happy just by
smiling?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, it's just a thought from
an old guy that has a few mood swings now
[SPEAKER_01]: than himself and anxiety and worries and
pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's an anti-stress thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, that's why you get the
munchies, because now it's time to relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means that we can stop fighting
for a while and we can stock up on food
[SPEAKER_01]: and we can have some sleep and we can
laugh it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the day's troubles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I didn't have it, you know,
I'd definitely not be a nicer person,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not saying that everybody needs it
or anything, but I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I can agree with that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you so much for taking the time
