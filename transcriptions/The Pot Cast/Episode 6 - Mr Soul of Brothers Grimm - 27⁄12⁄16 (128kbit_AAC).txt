[SPEAKER_01]: On behalf of the group and myself,
I'd like to say thank you for the
[SPEAKER_01]: audition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you and I hope we pass the audition.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: On behalf of the group and myself,
I'd like to say thank you and I hope we
[SPEAKER_01]: pass the audition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello and welcome to the next episode of
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: This episode was brought to you by the
Brothers Grimm, 420 Australia,
[SPEAKER_03]: and our newest sponsors, Organic Gardening
Solutions and The Billy Shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: On this episode, we feature Mr. Sol of the
Brothers Grimm.
[SPEAKER_04]: This episode's fairly laid back and you'll
probably hear it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alrighty, so a big thank you and welcome
to Mr. Sol for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just in the Brothers Grimm
facility right now in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can hear any fans, it's just
the fans keeping the plants happy behind
[SPEAKER_03]: us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you hear any fans, they're fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope you are as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first question I like to ask
everyone is, let's go back to the start.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time you ever smoked weed,
what was it like?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good story, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at my uncle's, well, I should say
where my uncle lived with my grandparents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have an uncle who, my father being
the oldest in the family, has a brother
[SPEAKER_02]: who's only five years older than myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I always admired him.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he was the cool uncle that being
that bit older than myself, when I would
[SPEAKER_02]: visit my grandparents' house, he would
always have interesting things in the
[SPEAKER_02]: drawers and all around in his room,
and I'd always go in and explore.
[SPEAKER_02]: One day, I found what was a half ounce of
Acapulco Gold in his drawer, and I picked
[SPEAKER_02]: that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he happened to be in the room as I did
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, wow, what is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, is this real marijuana?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, yeah, that's Acapulco Gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's some of the best in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, he said, have you already
smoked marijuana?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, my friends and I have been trying,
you know, been out in the woods and trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to find like if there's any wild marijuana
growing, then, you know, we tried to dry
[SPEAKER_02]: it out and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know how crazy that is if
everyone's had that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But growing up in the 70s, you know,
I guess we didn't have access to
[SPEAKER_02]: information like you do today and realize
our folly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at that moment, I was then taken away
from all of that silliness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my uncle rolled a real joint and took
me out in the backyard where he had this
[SPEAKER_02]: old van that was abandoned back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sat in the front seat and smoked the
joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I went into a dream, as the Beatles
said, and everything, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: from the moment someone spoke,
you know, it was like this spell had been
[SPEAKER_02]: cast where I'm guessing I'm going to wake
up later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this didn't really happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was just dreaming it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that was I just felt an affinity
to and a great liking of that experience
[SPEAKER_02]: and sought it out, you know, in years
after didn't come as frequently as,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, someone might today where they
say, hey, I really like marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to start smoking it all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the availability is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more of over the next year or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have a few experiences where working
in a nightclub as a busboy or a waiter or
[SPEAKER_02]: something in those circles, there were
people who were dealing pounds of
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I was just 17 or 18 in high
school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can remember them sort of implying
what they were doing and saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you want some?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they gave me like a matchbox full of
this great weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember enjoying that to myself,
you know, and having a couple of joints of
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, I started to,
you know, obviously meet people and have
[SPEAKER_02]: friends in school that were more into this
culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started having the availability of
marijuana much more frequently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got better and better at a rapid
rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in 10th grade in 1975.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you would buy an ounce of weed for
$40.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, you know, $10 per quarter,
basically, at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden, you know,
like five or 10 years later, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: all those prices sort of tripled and went
crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like three and four hundred and
five hundred dollars for an ounce in the
[SPEAKER_02]: 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now things have calmed back down from
there and such.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know I'm going tangential on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that was my first experience
getting high and experiencing what
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I I've never had another drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked LSD very much, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why that's obvious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take that back.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have commented many times that my
photography is influenced by LSD and comic
[SPEAKER_02]: books.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that that could be out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I definitely think it shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those two drugs, if you will,
have always been something that I felt
[SPEAKER_02]: were very natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my body had an affinity to I never
liked barbiturates and speed and these
[SPEAKER_02]: kinds of drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They always felt like an artificial thing,
whereas those other, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the two that I mentioned are either
natural or a synthetic version of
[SPEAKER_02]: something that is natural, like
psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, I guess what feels good for
my body is what I go for rather than,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I don't like to beat myself up
with alcohol and drink all night like some
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not that anything's wrong with that
lifestyle if they like it, but it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: for me because I was a sporty guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I rode bicycles most of my life and did
that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Motocross bicycle racing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciated being able to get on the
bike the next morning and not feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: shit and be able to actually go out there
and punish the other guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a big testosterone thing,
you know, when you're all out on your
[SPEAKER_02]: bicycles and racing each other to the town
line or who can get to the hill at the top
[SPEAKER_02]: fastest and such.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how long did it take before you
transitioned from just enthusiasm to home
[SPEAKER_03]: grower?
[SPEAKER_02]: I always felt like, oh, growing it would
be so difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was a child of about 10 and I
remember planting some pumpkin seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: that they didn't come up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I felt like, oh, growing a plant is
very hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I had that mindset for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, so consequently never really
tried all through high school,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and I didn't even understand the
concept of light photo, photo periods and
[SPEAKER_02]: triggers during the flowering response in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, when I was in college at the age
of about 21, I did discover that having
[SPEAKER_02]: picked up a book, Marijuana Horticulture
by Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I took that, read it, you know,
like cover to cover in a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just fascinated by the whole
idea that so that's how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean you can keep them from flowering
and you can make them flower just by
[SPEAKER_02]: changing the amount of daylight that they
receive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that was just phenomenal for me to
see.
[SPEAKER_02]: That concept was like so simple and
elegant and beautiful all at once and gave
[SPEAKER_02]: me such power and control over what I
could do.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mind just started, my imagination
started to go like, wow, that means,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, X, Y, Z.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went from there and it was a pretty
short time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Within a year, I had done some closet
grows and outdoor grows and near the
[SPEAKER_02]: college.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had lots of questions, started finding
that, you know, you could order seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: online, got Super Sativa Seed Club going
and ordered one or two of their packs of
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in those days, you know, you just send
a letter back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had questions, there was no email.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was 84 probably to 86 somewhere in
that period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we first started connecting and
then through those emails, through those
[SPEAKER_02]: mails, the company's owner called a guy
named Kesh, K-E-E-S wrote back to me
[SPEAKER_02]: saying, you know, you asked some very
interesting questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You seem to be an intelligent guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You seem to understand what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need people like yourself over in
the United States to help us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you be willing to work with us?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not knowing exactly what that meant,
it was a little vague.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, sure, let me know what you have in
mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, here's my phone number.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he called me after he got that letter,
told me what it was is that they would
[SPEAKER_02]: send me bulk quantities of each of the
strains of their seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: My job would be to receive letters from
them with the addresses and quantities of
[SPEAKER_02]: each of the seeds that are to be sent to
each of those addresses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd be their courier, you know,
inside the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's domestic forwarding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Distribute their seeds to the individuals
who had purchased them from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They paid them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're then paying me in envelopes of
hundred dollar bills that would come
[SPEAKER_02]: weekly as well with the orders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would, you know, pay more for a
larger order, you know, for the processing
[SPEAKER_02]: of the larger and a smaller order.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to know all the details,
but anyway, that was my job for them for
[SPEAKER_02]: four years, basically, while I went
through the last year of graduate school,
[SPEAKER_02]: then working probably the first two years
of my job out of college.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I met a woman who insisted that I
give up all the marijuana stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we just backtrack a little bit,
while you were growing out the SSC stock,
[SPEAKER_03]: what was your favorite of all of the stock
you grew out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we've heard from Skunk VA,
he mentioned that the Beatrix Choice was
[SPEAKER_03]: one of his favorites that doesn't often
get a mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never grew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would probably agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always sort of drooled over when I saw
the pictures that they posted of it in
[SPEAKER_02]: their brochures and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I never did for any, I don't know what
reason, I guess there were other things I
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to try first and never got around
to Beatrix Choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that and what's that, Williams Wonder
also was one I never grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, the Durbin tie was the thing
that I thought was like, wow, that was the
[SPEAKER_02]: most impressive and most personally
pleasing to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I crossed it with Skunk number one one
time and then grew it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seedlings, not a female that I had picked
out of a group that I had already flowered
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors and chosen like I would do today.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at that time, I just said,
oh, let me put out like 30, 50 seeds in
[SPEAKER_02]: this field that I had chosen that I felt
was secure enough and safe enough and
[SPEAKER_02]: hidden enough, but still got a lot of
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Went out there and hacked up the field and
got poison ivy all over myself later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found out that I'd gotten that and that
would happen to be going to Amsterdam for
[SPEAKER_02]: a week for a vacation right at that same
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just made it to a doctor and time before
leaving, she gave me some steroids and it
[SPEAKER_02]: cleared it up in like three days.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, back to the story,
I dug all the ground up and planted all
[SPEAKER_02]: these seeds and they came up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went out like two months later,
called the males and then two months
[SPEAKER_02]: later, I had all these big, beautiful
finished purplish buds and very sticky
[SPEAKER_02]: impressive females that were ready at the
end of October, relatively early for the
[SPEAKER_02]: cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I reported back to Keshe that I
had made that cross, he was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't usually get that result.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really have a hard time getting them to
flower fast enough to finish outdoors in a
[SPEAKER_02]: climate like Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, you should hold onto those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't have any more or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then having met the woman who I
eventually married, she made me give it
[SPEAKER_02]: all up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to send the seeds all back to
SSSC back in Amsterdam and didn't keep a
[SPEAKER_02]: cache of them for myself other than a
couple odd packs that were discovered by
[SPEAKER_02]: my wife and thrown out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to start all over after our
divorce.
[SPEAKER_03]: So take us to the day when you went to
Sensei Smile and found those seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that during one of those Amsterdam
trips you just mentioned?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: What it was then was I had been in Belgium
having gotten divorced from my first wife
[SPEAKER_02]: and spent two years in Belgium.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked on contracts there as a nuclear
engineer for a tractable company.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a civil engineering group that does
all of that type of work for the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a national establishment,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while I was there, I had met a Belgian
girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started living together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as my contract came to an end
after two years, she proposed that if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going back to America, because you
have no work permit here and can't
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to get a job, we could be married
and you'd be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either stay here or go back to America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, okay, we got married.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I looked for work in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to have stayed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did have that conflict of being a
divorced dad and my children were like
[SPEAKER_02]: three and six years old or something,
perhaps even a little bit less,
[SPEAKER_02]: like two and five.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was pulling at my heartstrings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in the end, I didn't find suitable
work there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I speak French now very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that time, it was a little bit
rudimentary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that probably in my interviews,
they felt like as French isn't really
[SPEAKER_02]: strong enough, he might not be able to
keep up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for whatever reason, it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the end, the things that always seem
to have happened in my life fall in place
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a disappointment in one place,
it's always like one door shutting while
[SPEAKER_02]: another opens.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had an opportunity to go to Boston and
we did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then before leaving, I knew that when
I got there, I would want to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow my own, having gotten used to being
able to get on a train and go up to
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam or even just over the border in
Breda.
[SPEAKER_02]: I often go there just to save myself the
trip of going all the way up to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: But point being, I would always have
available smoke and of very high quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't necessarily be able to do that
moving to Boston.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea what the availability of
good weed would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my Belgian wife was something of a
little bit reclusive, introverted type.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it really appealed to her as well
that, oh, great, you won't have to go out
[SPEAKER_02]: on the street for your weed and I know
you'll be home all the time taking care of
[SPEAKER_02]: your plants and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a great hobby for my husband and
such.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she was a very supportive wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after about two years living in
Boston, I was doing the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation full-time and supporting
myself, sending child support back to my
[SPEAKER_02]: ex-wife and everything all from proceeds
that I made in the basement of that home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it felt great doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, it was very
stressful in the sense that if it had ever
[SPEAKER_02]: blown up at the time, late 90s,
you could do 20, 25 years for cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: in Boston.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my wife would have had a field day,
alert the media.
[SPEAKER_02]: My husband is a complete scandal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Raising our children and having them every
other weekend in this den of inequity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was that aspect of it that was
stressful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I said to you once before that
I was also day trading as most people were
[SPEAKER_02]: during like 99 and just leading up into
2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: I turned a $5,000 starting point into
about $55,000 in a year and then lost
[SPEAKER_02]: about 25 of it as things started to come
down in March of 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just decided don't let any more
go and save that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sold the house right a little bit after
9-11, maybe three, four months later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And having done that, we had some cash in
our pockets and I had closed up everything
[SPEAKER_02]: from what I was doing with the Brothers
Grimm operation in my basement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we moved back to Belgium with a fair
chunk of money in our pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought I'd sit on my hands for a
little while and then maybe look for a
[SPEAKER_02]: place in Belgium where I'd have greenhouse
facilities, indoor facilities and such and
[SPEAKER_02]: restart up the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may remember Gypsy Nirvana from,
what was that company, London Direct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeds Direct UK, I believe it was,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, a little dodgy, kind of a dodgy
character.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's his reputation and I found it to be
a little bit so as well when I met him.
[SPEAKER_02]: We spent a day hanging out, maybe the
weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may have seen each other the next day
too, drove around a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: visited some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shanti Baba was one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that woman's, the woman who does
the hash in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her name, Mila, Mila.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The isolator.
[SPEAKER_02]: The isolator is her invention.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's touted to be the inventor of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, met her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lovely time there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, why was I there?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had come back, as I say, from Boston
and I was trying to establish something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I was up there talking to folks
like Mila and Gypsy Nirvana but nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: seemed to click.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never felt comfortable that I'd be able
to get the whole thing started again
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I again went to sitting on my hands mode
and enjoyed Belgium and played guitar for
[SPEAKER_02]: four hours a day and rode a bicycle two
hours a day or four hours a day or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rode with the bicycle clubs on the
weekends and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just really had a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I firmed up my language skills very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that time, people just assumed I spoke
French and spoke French all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great experience for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came back to the United States at a
certain moment after two years in Belgium
[SPEAKER_02]: because of the children.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, the kids are crying on the phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Daddy's basically abandoned them and
decided to go off and live his selfish
[SPEAKER_02]: life in Europe, satisfying his dreams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just felt maybe they weren't saying
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, but felt that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just felt very guilty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had been in this marriage more as
convenient as we were in love in a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: sense but there was also a limitation to
that where when push came to shove,
[SPEAKER_02]: we were at a fork in our existence where
she couldn't return to America because her
[SPEAKER_02]: parents were older and failing and needed
her.
[SPEAKER_02]: My children were young and developing and
needing me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to sort of agree that I'm going
back to America.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to stay here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: We stayed married on paper for the next
seven years and then finally decided,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, let's put it on paper that we're not
married anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still great friends and we'll send
each other birthday cards and hello at
[SPEAKER_02]: Christmas and email and what have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That ended in an amicable way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then during about the next seven years in
America, I worked as everything from
[SPEAKER_02]: selling home improvements, kitchen
remodeling, bathroom remodeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to be very good visiting people's
homes and just doing little demos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to be, since I was a little kid,
I've always been the show and tell guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife will always say to people too,
Ricky's like the show and tell guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll want to trot out his latest
whatever it is, having gathered everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: in the living room.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was how I was as a kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I went into sales, I just really
enjoyed that home.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole razzle dazzle of getting the
person interested in having their kitchen
[SPEAKER_02]: done and getting them excited about
closing the deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the way that thing worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to be in and out of their home in
three hours time and either they bought
[SPEAKER_02]: then or they never would.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a one call close, they called it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to be pretty good at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made me a manager and put me in
charge of sales team.
[SPEAKER_02]: For about four or five years, I did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I was called back to engineering.
[SPEAKER_02]: A fellow called me up and said,
I found your resume on monster.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a nuclear engineer, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are here in Boston and we really need a
guy like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'll come in and interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got the job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Started working for Arriva.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a French company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finished with them after four years and
moved to New York City, married a woman
[SPEAKER_02]: that I knew from high school, having
reconnected through Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: After four years of living in New York
City with her, working as eventually
[SPEAKER_02]: professional photographer as a sideline
job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did also work as a nuclear engineer,
but in sales for a company called
[SPEAKER_02]: Hightork.
[SPEAKER_02]: After four years with them, my job was
basically phased out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were changing their strategy on how
they did their sales and such.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't working for me and them anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, again, a door closing that seemed
like a disappointing moment at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then a couple of months later,
I'm finding myself being swept back into
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis cultivation and seed production
and reopening Brothers Grimm and being
[SPEAKER_02]: very excited at the realization that after
all of waiting these years on the
[SPEAKER_02]: sidelines and cheering along the
legalization that was happening in various
[SPEAKER_02]: states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, the two by four slapped me in the
side of the head and said, hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: by the way, if you were to move to one of
those states, you may well restart your
[SPEAKER_02]: business and do what you really love to do
as you're living.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having started to scratch the surface of
reaching out to my old partners and
[SPEAKER_02]: friends and of course Sly to this day has
never resurfaced.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know whatever happened to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our working relationship was always
pristine and we got along famously,
[SPEAKER_02]: left everything on good terms,
but he's either lost interest in this
[SPEAKER_02]: business or been killed or is in prison or
who knows what happens to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, the opportunity was to partner up
with someone who could be that other side
[SPEAKER_02]: of Brothers Grimm, Duke Diamond.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was connected to him through Subcool and
I took a chance on coming out and meeting
[SPEAKER_02]: and found that he was beyond my
expectations, excellent mate for me to do
[SPEAKER_02]: this business.
[SPEAKER_02]: We slowly put it together from the very
early beginnings of starting seeds that
[SPEAKER_02]: would be used to find the right males to
cross to the clones of genius and princess
[SPEAKER_02]: that I had recovered from the people had
been holding them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can imagine, you know,
wanting to have rooms full of plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: making seeds, you know, great guns and
looking at this little four by four area,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, lit by one lamp and like that's
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: My pockets are empty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have everything right there in this
little four by four area and that's got to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow and prosper and multiply and become
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, you know, here we are a year
later and it's a full blown, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: seed growing operation with we're in the
black and operating, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and with a future and always planning to
ramp things up from where we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's growing at a great rate that it
doesn't seem inordinately fast or slow,
[SPEAKER_02]: yet organic, just like we grow our plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while you were a nuclear engineer,
among other things, how did you feel about
[SPEAKER_03]: having this secret the whole time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you feel like you were the anomaly or
did you think that maybe there's another
[SPEAKER_03]: nuclear engineer who's, you know,
I missed a soul by night?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two answers to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I through that whole time felt
like, yeah, this is a secret, not only
[SPEAKER_02]: from employers, but I also felt in dating,
you know, that was always sort of a
[SPEAKER_02]: delicate at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it isn't so much today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm now 57 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: So imagine when I'm 30 or, you know,
25 and yeah, I have that education.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm in that profession.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I'm out meeting women or
something, dropping that, I also happen to
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy smoking cannabis, you know,
in my free time on weekends and evenings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm almost a daily smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could chase away potentially
interesting women and I guess I should
[SPEAKER_02]: have realized that, you know, the right
girls are going to accept me for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the hell with the ones who don't,
you know, but that was my mindset at the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then with the employer, it was also
like, geez, I can't let my hair down and
[SPEAKER_02]: let them know that would be something that
maybe I'm getting away with the fact that
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working for an employer who won't
randomly drug test me and I know I'm safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no sense, you know, raising,
you know, an alarm to myself or calling
[SPEAKER_02]: any attention to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to keep that quiet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there's that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to cap off that side of it,
I think that I love this new expression
[SPEAKER_02]: I've come up with where the letters are
the same number of letters and everything
[SPEAKER_02]: fits in place, you know, pot is the new
gay, we're the ones coming out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: closet now, you know, so I think that
would make a great slogan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I do that segues into your other
hat, the other half of your question feel
[SPEAKER_02]: that there are so many people,
yeah, who were in the closet didn't reveal
[SPEAKER_02]: as I didn't, that they were cannabis
aficionados in the closet, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's all coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are statistics right now that I
just read the other day that the fastest
[SPEAKER_02]: growing cannabis consumption age group is
something like, you know, the baby
[SPEAKER_02]: boomers, you know, or just my I'm a little
bit younger than baby boomer age.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're saying like people 50 to 60 or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 to 75.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the biggest, most burgeoning group
of pot smokers, because they're all coming
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the closet and saying, hey,
fuck it, man, I've always wanted I've
[SPEAKER_02]: always enjoyed this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lawyer who was a great friend of
mine who lives in Chicago, who only
[SPEAKER_02]: revealed to me like during this past year,
when he found out what I did, and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: being open about it, I had come out,
he reached out to me and said,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God, you know, I've been a pot
smoker since the 60s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love really the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see from your pictures that you're
posting and so that you're amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know about your whole history,
you know, that we've been friends,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, on and off over the years,
but we lost touch for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, so you're Mr. Soul.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so and in the end, you know,
I send him some samples and he smokes
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, I can't he's writing back
to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot believe this amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You make better marijuana than I've ever
smoked in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, oh, you know, the whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, we are not worthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's wonderful to have that sort of
openness now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do feel like, you know, coming it's like
a coming out, you know, and it's a great
[SPEAKER_02]: feeling, especially being open about the
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm proud of everything I've ever done
with Brothers Grimm and to have not done
[SPEAKER_02]: what I just recently did reopen the
company and pull this back to the future
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have always felt like you have to
understand we'd go to cocktail parties or
[SPEAKER_02]: be at friends homes and the story would be
trotted out by my wife or some friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you know that, you know,
Rick here, he's famous in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: He used to be this world famous breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: He created the strange Cinderella 99.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, oh, that's really him.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it was making me feel like
a has been.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to hear these stories and I'm
not doing it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh, yeah, you know,
don't trot that old story out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like I talk about what I do
now, you know, I'm a photographic artist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having exhibitions in New York City to
do that, you know, forget the pot thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there was this excellent segue
between that last job and before I came
[SPEAKER_02]: out here to Colorado, which was that a
friend of my wife's having heard that old
[SPEAKER_02]: story, you know, about me and was on
vacation talking to a fellow who she had
[SPEAKER_02]: met two couples, you know, on the beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, let's have dinner or drinks or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Later on, they start talking about their
lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy says, I work as the operations
manager for Tweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: She says, what's Tweed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tweed is a company in Canada that is the
sole producer of all the medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: that is consumed in the entire country.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are the one official source that the
government says is at least that's what I
[SPEAKER_02]: believe the arrangement is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he hears through her little story about
Mr. Soul and who I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's friends with my wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he says, I'd love to interview the
guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we would probably want to employ
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: She says, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll find out if he's OK with you calling
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, OK, he calls me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, we're going to get you tickets
and fly you up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I flew up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent a day touring the facility,
talking to the master grower and all of
[SPEAKER_02]: the other, you know, people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, they have a master
grower there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The interview went really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody liked each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I felt like, you know, the guy wants
me and he told me he wanted me for the
[SPEAKER_02]: job.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were considering some other people,
a woman included, who had come from an
[SPEAKER_02]: entirely different background.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were looking for an operation,
you know, cultivation manager that would
[SPEAKER_02]: be the boss of this fellow, who would be
the master grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he told me about a month later that,
OK, management made a decision to go with
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody who was more immediately
available, even if they didn't have the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis specific experience, due to the
fact that our lawyers are saying it would
[SPEAKER_02]: take us a lot of time to immigrate you
into Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't even made you an offer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may very well say you don't want to
move to Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, yeah, you know, you're doing
the right thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see what's happening here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, but we are really interested in
another side idea, which would be to
[SPEAKER_02]: license the Brothers Grimm name on
products like if we were to produce
[SPEAKER_02]: Cinderella 99 and we could say that,
you know, it's bona fide and licensed by
[SPEAKER_02]: Brothers Grimm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought, that's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about that whenever you're
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: He let that sit on the back burner.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're way too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after like four months went by and
been in touch once a month or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, right now we can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are, you know, these and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, look, I'm going to have to let that
whole thing go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrote him an email and said,
look, that's not going to move forward,
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am going to relocate to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to reopen the company,
Brothers Grimm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will not probably be interested in
that right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: But down the road, we could talk about it,
what have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the seed that that put in my mind of,
you know, this was a possibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could return to being Mr. Sol and
running Brothers Grimm again just based on
[SPEAKER_02]: having been interviewed by them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the little light bulb went on in my
head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as the one door was closing with the
job with high torque as an engineer there,
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that, well, I either dig deep and
try to continue being a photographer in
[SPEAKER_02]: New York City.
[SPEAKER_02]: And potential is not that great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And photography and photographers are
starting to go into a very it's all so
[SPEAKER_02]: ubiquitous, just like music, you know,
pay for like $15 albums anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You download music for next to nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same things happening with images and
photography.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so many people are taking so many
wonderful pictures with the technology
[SPEAKER_02]: that's available and the information
that's available to become a better
[SPEAKER_02]: photographer so much faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine if you are learning photography
now, you're able to immediately see the
[SPEAKER_02]: results of every picture you take.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a huge biofeedback mechanism that
was absent in the days of film when I was
[SPEAKER_02]: learning photography in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to wait until I went to a
drugstore and dropped off a roll of film
[SPEAKER_02]: and got it several days later to figure
out what I did wrong a week ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's akin to you're a musician.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had been forced to learn how to
play guitar by having earplugs in your
[SPEAKER_02]: ears and recording your lessons while you
played by sight and then later had to
[SPEAKER_02]: listen back to them, but not right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was only after you brought the tape
down and had it processed and got it back
[SPEAKER_02]: a week later and then you could figure out
what the fuck you were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That lack of immediate biofeedback would
slow down the learning process and extend
[SPEAKER_02]: it by such a great amount of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what was happening to us as
burgeoning photographers of those days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I've seen guys where they've had two
years experience as a photographer and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're taking professional level amazing
pictures because they paid attention and
[SPEAKER_02]: tried to educate themselves with all of
the available videos on YouTube and
[SPEAKER_02]: information from other sources that they
can just immediately learn how to create a
[SPEAKER_02]: great image and how to master the
technology of their own camera and light
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the price of that is all going down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, I went a long way off on a tangent to
explain why I didn't decide to stay in New
[SPEAKER_02]: York and stay a photographer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, have you ever considered moving your
passion over to cannabis photography?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean that's happening actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an immediate need for me to be
able to take pictures and transmit what
[SPEAKER_02]: we're doing visually on Instagram and
other social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the nice photos are coming from you
and not Duke?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, he's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of his pictures have been done with
his cell phone until very recently and I
[SPEAKER_02]: just think I showed him here here's where
the sliders are on Instagram one day and I
[SPEAKER_02]: never said another word to him and
immediately started doing like really
[SPEAKER_02]: great pictures and moving the you know
controls around.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I would never it's not a
competition mate.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how I look at everything in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like we're all colleagues and we're
all unique and we're all trying to do our
[SPEAKER_02]: own thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to make comparisons.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who Jack Kerouac is the writer
right American writer did on the road in
[SPEAKER_02]: his book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dharma Bums there's one character who says
comparisons are odious and it's just like
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like we're all doing our own
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all everybody's got their own scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a competition, you know,
so again with the photography it did it
[SPEAKER_02]: did parlay right into an immediate it
became an immediate benefit to me to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked at my Instagram feed today and
thought to myself, yeah, you know just
[SPEAKER_02]: dawns on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good that I've been able to produce
good images of what we're doing and make
[SPEAKER_02]: nice artistic sometimes and sometimes just
very, you know, this is what it is just so
[SPEAKER_02]: you can see the reality of what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I have been able to play around
with my style of photography and adapting
[SPEAKER_02]: that to taking pictures of cannabis rather
than you know architecture and cityscapes,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is what I used to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we tie it all back in I guess my
question would be if you knew that things
[SPEAKER_03]: would go the way they have would you have
considered coming back sooner?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: But remember even two years ago Colorado
had just started to have legalization and
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if any other states were
quite so accessible in terms of being a
[SPEAKER_02]: good enough place to live in terms of
creature comforts and where I would want
[SPEAKER_02]: to be and also have the ability to grow
with basically, you know an impunity that
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never experienced before and I could
feel comfortable doing it openly as we
[SPEAKER_02]: are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I mean if all the conditions had
been right, I would have done it earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had gotten a mindset over the years that
ah, you know, I don't think the numbers
[SPEAKER_02]: work and so on but as I started to explore
it and legalization had been running for
[SPEAKER_02]: some time then I did see that oh,
okay other people are showing me how this
[SPEAKER_02]: would work as a seed company and it could
be profitable whereas I had never really
[SPEAKER_02]: considered the seed money being enough to
live on as it wasn't back in the day when
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing this in my basement in Boston.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the money I made was through a
contact I had in southern Massachusetts
[SPEAKER_02]: who would take pounds of high-grade weed
from me and I was breeding for you know
[SPEAKER_02]: growing good Zinsamia to send to this guy
and make my rent every month and pay the
[SPEAKER_02]: bills whereas the seed money was an
occasional pop that came from Canada that
[SPEAKER_02]: was like oh that's nice to have that extra
few thousand dollars or whatever it
[SPEAKER_02]: happened to be might have been as much as
15 at a time or so but I didn't think that
[SPEAKER_02]: there was a way to make a living but as I
say you know it was shown to me no no it
[SPEAKER_02]: works so yeah here we are and like I say
we're able to pay the bills every month
[SPEAKER_02]: and do what we love so yeah pretty happy
with the way things are going.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we think back to the initial
incarnation a lot of growers and breeders
[SPEAKER_03]: alike think of it as this golden era you
know you had the original Brothers Grimm
[SPEAKER_03]: people like Tom Hill and Vic High
releasing strains did you ever realize
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're a part of an age that would be
looked back on with you know this kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: reminiscent envy or did it just feel like
same old same old at the time?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is again you know with the experience
of my age and so on I've come across
[SPEAKER_02]: things where I can answer that pretty
simply because everybody who's ever gone
[SPEAKER_02]: through this can can relate to there's a
quote by I can't remember exactly who to
[SPEAKER_02]: attribute it to but he said one never
knows when one is making history so it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like while you're making history you're
just doing it you're not thinking you're
[SPEAKER_02]: making history and then you look back and
you realize oh I made history so there's
[SPEAKER_02]: your answer I guess it's universal it's
not unique it's to me but it fits I feel
[SPEAKER_02]: that that's a good response for myself as
well as being sort of universal response.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome so one of the things I always
noticed and also you know really kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: praised the original release of Cindy was
was that when you did the original Cindy
[SPEAKER_03]: there wasn't really many cubing projects
going on and I always wondered where did
[SPEAKER_03]: you get the idea to do a cube it's it's
even today not many people think of it as
[SPEAKER_03]: a breeding project a lot of people are
more into f1s yeah how did you find out
[SPEAKER_03]: about what would be regarded as a fairly
advanced breeding idea?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody I know at that time or had ever
heard of or I don't think anybody has ever
[SPEAKER_02]: claimed to be have been doing a breeding
project that involved cubing or was cubing
[SPEAKER_02]: anything at that time I think I was the
first person to actually actively take
[SPEAKER_02]: that idea and run with it I just felt that
I read an article once in a High Times
[SPEAKER_02]: magazine that alluded to that process and
it seemed like nobody ever talked about it
[SPEAKER_02]: or no one ever really noticed it but it
piqued my interest and I said huh it may
[SPEAKER_02]: sound simplistic but each time a male and
female mate the children get 50% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: mother and father and then humans and
mammals and people that live on a timeline
[SPEAKER_02]: that's continuous whereas cannabis can be
brought back in time and forward in time
[SPEAKER_02]: if you will by taking a clone from a
female plant that's being kept in a
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetative state it's as though time is
being made to stand still there and then
[SPEAKER_02]: you can take cuttings from that female and
do any kind of breeding growing with them
[SPEAKER_02]: that you like and then the offspring of
say a male of that generation being bred
[SPEAKER_02]: back to the original female if you think
about it it's already got 50% of that of
[SPEAKER_02]: his mother's genes so if we take a boy
from the first generation he's already
[SPEAKER_02]: half P princess let's say from the cubing
process I did to make Cinderella 99 and
[SPEAKER_02]: she's contributing again half of her P to
the mix that becomes the the children of
[SPEAKER_02]: that cross so having half of her already
he can contribute only 25% so there he's
[SPEAKER_02]: contributed 25% she always contributes 50%
so each time you're getting 25% plus the
[SPEAKER_02]: 50% that next generation is going to have
75% so then half of 75% is like 37.5 so
[SPEAKER_02]: you get round it you get a P 88 generation
and then if you do the P 88 generation
[SPEAKER_02]: you're adding 44 and 50 so now you're at
94% P if you will sounds simplistic
[SPEAKER_02]: there's probably some flaws to the whole
process right however if you're careful
[SPEAKER_02]: about the male selection each time it's
almost like you're doing a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: guidance like F2 to F3 to F4 and such when
you're guiding those generations you're
[SPEAKER_02]: also choosing which plants to mate in each
generation so I had in each generation of
[SPEAKER_02]: P 88 P 94 and such the males that would
resemble princess was my simplistic way of
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at okay the more it resembles the
female the more this one is carrying that
[SPEAKER_02]: trait and each time it did seem to make
improvements and bring the plant more
[SPEAKER_02]: toward the princess however I did want to
choose for more larger branches bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: colas sweeter flavors more pleasing high
rather than the devastating knock you down
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of high from the original princess
you've been smoking a little bit of it
[SPEAKER_03]: lately yeah I can attest to that so when
you started the cubing process we know now
[SPEAKER_03]: that you use the Shiva skunk as the
original male why did you choose that and
[SPEAKER_02]: were you considering any others no I I had
two choices in my mind I could choose a
[SPEAKER_02]: very similar plant and use a brother and
then more likelihood that some family
[SPEAKER_02]: genes are already in there on the male
side and you wouldn't have to back cross
[SPEAKER_02]: as far but then it would leave me a little
more confused as to how to choose where
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting away from the male side the
original male side and getting more and
[SPEAKER_02]: more toward just the princess qualities so
I felt the other option was to go with
[SPEAKER_02]: something that was so obviously different
that every generation I'd be able to sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of cull away the skunky side of it and go
more toward the princess phenotype and see
[SPEAKER_02]: that the females in each generation were
also producing better and better quality
[SPEAKER_02]: with the sweeter flavors the larger colas
the larger branches and more structure
[SPEAKER_02]: than princess had so princess turns out to
be more valuable plant as a breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: female than she would be in terms of just
growing that for people consumers to want
[SPEAKER_03]: to buy that bud yeah so some people would
argue that genius is almost as valuable as
[SPEAKER_03]: a plant as princess in terms of the
strains that they've gone on to create
[SPEAKER_03]: have you ever considered doing a similar
curing project with genius I didn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: time I ran out of time back in the day and
now I can do so I might there's your
[SPEAKER_02]: answer I mean it's likely you know I think
that having done the green Avenger we
[SPEAKER_02]: really got sort of a plant that was so
much beefier and more compact and easier
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow and you still had the flavor and
mind the the psychoactivity of genius so
[SPEAKER_02]: right right there with green Avenger we
sort of hit on a nice what would be a seed
[SPEAKER_02]: form of genius but with many improvements
but if you were to try to go and get
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody the genius in seed form thing I
kind of question the value of it you know
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know I want it I think we've
improved it yeah yeah so but again
[SPEAKER_03]: valuable as a breeding female yeah so have
you got any rough ideas as to what might
[SPEAKER_03]: have been the male which pollinated the
Jack Harrow which to end up creating the
[SPEAKER_02]: princess genius and the cafe girl seeds I
would like to say from everything that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen now in the past year or so of
observing more plants of different
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties that are available for me to
observe than I ever had before I've now
[SPEAKER_02]: got a much better handle on where before I
said look it's whatever I don't know like
[SPEAKER_02]: really I wouldn't like to even throw out a
guess because it's just meaningless to
[SPEAKER_02]: guess isn't it you know so today having
seen the structure of Jack Harrow sorry
[SPEAKER_02]: having seen the structure of a Durban pure
Durban and knowing that super sativa seed
[SPEAKER_02]: club and sensei you know they all worked
with some Durban and it's likely they may
[SPEAKER_02]: have had some Durban pollen flow around
and just a few you know that like I say
[SPEAKER_02]: that bud that I broke open and sensei
smile which I have to return to that story
[SPEAKER_02]: by the way was mostly bud I mean it really
didn't have more than six seeds in it and
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it was a reasonable sized bag get
from an Amsterdam coffee shop and the
[SPEAKER_02]: reason I was there just to finish that
story was before leaving and knowing that
[SPEAKER_02]: I would want to grow weed in America when
we got to Boston we went to Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically to go buy a bunch of seeds
and I went in the sensei shop right next
[SPEAKER_02]: to the or right nearby the hash museum on
that little canal there and I bought a few
[SPEAKER_02]: packs of seeds and one of them being the
Shiva skunk yeah and a couple others and
[SPEAKER_02]: lo and behold after having bought the
seeds you know we want to get a cup of
[SPEAKER_02]: coffee and go smoke the joint or something
that's how I ended up in the sensei smile
[SPEAKER_02]: just to finish the recap that little
missing tidbit did you ever after having
[SPEAKER_03]: popped the seeds get the urge to go back
to sensei smile and try to now that was
[SPEAKER_02]: just such a chance thing that you know you
find a hundred dollar bill you know in a
[SPEAKER_02]: parking lot you don't go back there every
day walking the parking lot looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: dollar bills but it was really was just an
off thing that hey great but I did
[SPEAKER_02]: coincidentally I don't think I've ever
told anybody this story but when I came
[SPEAKER_02]: back a few days after having gone on that
little sojourn and bought the seeds I
[SPEAKER_02]: thought well the ones that came out of
that bud just for the hell of it I'll try
[SPEAKER_02]: to germinate a couple and grow and see
what they look like before we leave we had
[SPEAKER_02]: another week or so or a month before we
were going to leave we had a balcony and a
[SPEAKER_02]: little you know space there I could sit a
pot out and two or three of those seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: popped up and grew and I ended up having
to call them just before leaving and just
[SPEAKER_02]: like you know yeah they seem to be healthy
and they grew well who knows what they
[SPEAKER_02]: could have been you know I don't know well
every good story has to have that low
[SPEAKER_02]: moment you know for us to crawl out of and
become champions at the end so I wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: such a low moment at all because I still
did have you know four to six seeds left
[SPEAKER_02]: that I brought to America and when I ended
up germing everything from the packets as
[SPEAKER_02]: well as those freebie seeds that rolled
out of my weed in this coffee shop they
[SPEAKER_02]: turned out to have been the stars you know
weirdly enough and you know I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: recommend to people as you know today to
buy seeds that have a lot of variety and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know be on you know hunts you know
you're causing yourself a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: unnecessary work I feel that one should
just simply ask a few questions to himself
[SPEAKER_02]: like what is it what is it that I would
like in terms of what type of plant if I
[SPEAKER_02]: were to have to write down all the
characteristics of what I'd like might
[SPEAKER_02]: vary from person to person wouldn't you
agree but there is such a strain out there
[SPEAKER_02]: likely to line up with what every what
someone's wish list would contain and
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't it be logical to just buy a pack
of those seeds and grow them and how and
[SPEAKER_02]: get to the finish line do you really want
to buy you know something that is a poly
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrid with another poly hybrid saying oh
boy those are both great things well you
[SPEAKER_02]: know chicken cordon bleu and asparagus is
a lovely meal but I don't want to mix it
[SPEAKER_02]: with a hot fudge sundae at the same time
they're both lovely things but putting
[SPEAKER_02]: them together doesn't necessarily make a
great thing and many people who are
[SPEAKER_02]: neophytes to this craft or this passion or
you know want to grow marijuana I think
[SPEAKER_02]: they get caught up in the lore as many
beginners in any field do there's an old
[SPEAKER_02]: saying beginner never under does anything
you know that usually you'll find that
[SPEAKER_02]: their errors come from overdoing something
over watering over fertilizing over loving
[SPEAKER_02]: you know over handling until they get to
where they learn to let things be you know
[SPEAKER_02]: and not disturb them too much and know
that less is more sometimes so I just feel
[SPEAKER_02]: that sometimes people get caught up in the
names like you know superstar fucker and
[SPEAKER_02]: and porn star imagine you know it's like a
fucking porn movie the you know the guy
[SPEAKER_02]: with the 12 inch dick is gonna fuck the
woman with the huge ass or whatever I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know that what they think is gonna
come out of these crosses but having not
[SPEAKER_02]: at least ask yourself what would I really
like to have as an ideal plant and is does
[SPEAKER_02]: it already exist and can I buy a pack of
seeds where I'll reliably get a dozen of
[SPEAKER_02]: them instead of maybe I'll get that
special one out of this I don't know you
[SPEAKER_02]: boys I may be from a different generation
or something some of the younger folks
[SPEAKER_02]: seem to enjoy that and take some pride in
I'm on a fino hunt of some sort like
[SPEAKER_02]: they're on a safari in Africa slashing
away with a machete somewhere riding home
[SPEAKER_03]: once I'm fine I don't know yeah no it's
interesting everyone I've ever spoken to
[SPEAKER_03]: has always said that they don't like fino
hunting per se like it's just kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: viewed as a necessity so is there any
plans for any feminized projects from
[SPEAKER_02]: Brothers Grimm we're working on it because
there's such a demand I've always been
[SPEAKER_02]: against it but again you know I come back
into this craft years later with many
[SPEAKER_02]: advancements in the technology as well as
an understanding of soil that was
[SPEAKER_02]: unprecedented at my time you know in the
90s and I think that knowing how to
[SPEAKER_02]: properly make feminized seeds and not
doing it willy-nilly if we can prove to
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves it's a reliable method that we
can master that I don't produce
[SPEAKER_02]: hermaphrodites that's something I've never
you know grown anything that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: hermaphrodite produced any seeds that
produce hermaphrodites I'm really proud of
[SPEAKER_02]: that and my fear has always been if we
tried to make feminized seeds we may be
[SPEAKER_02]: making some percentage of hermaphrodites
and I want to avoid that at all cost so if
[SPEAKER_02]: I get the chance sorry if I should prove
to myself and over this next period of
[SPEAKER_02]: time that we're working on that project I
am convinced that yes we can reliably
[SPEAKER_02]: produce feminized seeds and people will
not have hermaphrodites they'll have great
[SPEAKER_02]: feminized seed or feminine plants by all
means I'd love to do that yeah so we're
[SPEAKER_03]: trying we're working on it would you ever
consider trying to hit a Jack Harrah with
[SPEAKER_03]: a Durban and try to recreate the original
seeds you got in a certain regard I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think so um you know that cross isn't
possible uh with what we have in the house
[SPEAKER_02]: at the moment we'd have to make a
feminized version of it yeah but yeah by
[SPEAKER_02]: all means feminizing it with that in that
direction we have so many combinations
[SPEAKER_02]: that you could sit back and you know
Monday morning quarterback about how
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't that be cool if you did there's
so many combinations you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: prioritize and select the ones that all
right these are what we're doing as a
[SPEAKER_02]: company and moving forward and this is
just you know maybe not an interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: thing I don't know you make those choices
I'm sorry yeah it could very well be a
[SPEAKER_02]: great idea I just don't know if that's on
the horizon anytime soon no worries yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: so if we look at the average or even the
better Jack Harrah cut we noticed that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not really as potent as say Princess
do you think that Princess was kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: just a one in a million where that potency
got really jacked up because I mean if we
[SPEAKER_03]: think about Durban it's not a strain it's
typically known for its potency so it
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't appear on paper as though it would
jack the potency up of a Jack Harrah and
[SPEAKER_02]: yet it did yeah again whatever it did
genetics is a lottery you know it's a it's
[SPEAKER_02]: a statistics game and with every strain
that exists at the moment sort of deriving
[SPEAKER_02]: from you know a few basic starting points
and then being morphed from there when you
[SPEAKER_02]: combine a Jack Harrah that probably has at
least three to five different lines that
[SPEAKER_02]: come into it from various origins and then
the Durban which is just a land race
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to get less variation than
two poly hybrids but you're still going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have those odd numbers that come up those
odd lottery numbers you know because each
[SPEAKER_02]: plant is basically like a lottery number
and if you have this if you can envision a
[SPEAKER_02]: jug of marbles you know that we're going
to put in a hopper and spin them and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know you can only take out six at a time
and that's your plant and you have only
[SPEAKER_02]: two different colors in that hopper there
aren't going to be a lot of variations
[SPEAKER_02]: among the plants and they're going to be
pretty predictable but when you have 18
[SPEAKER_02]: different color marbles in there and
you're taking out six at a time you may
[SPEAKER_02]: very well have six of one color you may
have you know one is each of the six a
[SPEAKER_02]: different color and another one that has
six where each of them is a different
[SPEAKER_02]: color but not the same colors as its
neighbor you know so there's so many ways
[SPEAKER_02]: those lottery numbers can come out
princess is just one that the right
[SPEAKER_02]: combination to get those qualities existed
and the next door neighbor in the same bud
[SPEAKER_02]: the genius seed grew into a genius which
doesn't look a lot like in many regards
[SPEAKER_02]: princess except in certain ways that you
can see a family resemblance maybe more in
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering than in veg yeah so yeah it's a
it's that lottery number business of the
[SPEAKER_02]: lack of predictability when you have a lot
of genes in play like that yeah you just
[SPEAKER_02]: can't say well hey who would have thought
crossing Durban to the jack-harrow would
[SPEAKER_02]: have boosted potency no I bet if you
looked at the averages that didn't but you
[SPEAKER_02]: have those outs the outliers and she's an
outlier basically yeah how's that so the
[SPEAKER_03]: brothers groom are now looking at working
with various members of the chem dog
[SPEAKER_03]: family the cuttings what is it about the
chem dogs that are appealing to you and
[SPEAKER_03]: what type of projects would you envision
with them I think because they are almost
[SPEAKER_02]: so opposite from the types of strains that
I've always concentrated on and been known
[SPEAKER_02]: for the more cerebral fruitier flavored
you know those up highs and the turps and
[SPEAKER_02]: so on that are more akin to what people
are smoking in dabs today I guess the chem
[SPEAKER_02]: dog line especially 91 oh excuse me
appeals to me in that it's a counterpoint
[SPEAKER_02]: to the types of weed that I normally smoke
and it's such a nice refreshing change and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know it's almost unbeknownst to me
that my attitude my energy level and so on
[SPEAKER_02]: is what it is when I'm smoking my usual
types of strains and I could actually use
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit of chill pill sometimes and
the 91 chem dog will give me that like
[SPEAKER_02]: deep earthy connect back to earth kind of
thing instead of being out in space and it
[SPEAKER_02]: makes me feel a body high that's relaxing
and can put me in a state of relaxation
[SPEAKER_02]: and also has that old world like back in
high school people would sell brown
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombian weed and the taste had that
earthiness to it and that kept having dog
[SPEAKER_02]: has that earthy flavor so there's a
nostalgia to the flavor there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: counterpoint counter reaction that sort of
is a good mate to the highs that I get
[SPEAKER_02]: from the more sativa leaning cerebral pot
that I smoke most of the time and so do
[SPEAKER_03]: you have any projects you'd be willing to
share that you might even just vaguely
[SPEAKER_02]: envision doing with it yeah we're trying
to think about ways where that heavier
[SPEAKER_02]: Indica leaning you know there's the you
just can't get much more Indica's than
[SPEAKER_02]: these you know hash plants and 91 chem
dogs and those types of things that bring
[SPEAKER_02]: that Tommy brings to the table do diamond
and he he and I always think about like
[SPEAKER_02]: wow you know what if we did this and you
know recently we went the other way we're
[SPEAKER_02]: not the Indica side but we use the hazy
Cinderella 99 haze super silver super
[SPEAKER_02]: silver haze to get princess and Paula make
that Apollo haze and the princess haze
[SPEAKER_02]: from genius and princess so the next
logical step is to sort of take a heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: Indica side thing and go the other way you
know and take princess and genius and see
[SPEAKER_02]: what would happen I'd be excited to see
and we have seeds produced already from
[SPEAKER_02]: some of those heavy Indica side of course
we have had to not take the female and
[SPEAKER_02]: reverse it to get pollen we don't do that
or haven't done yet so if we were to try
[SPEAKER_02]: to incorporate chem dog into say
Cinderella 99 we'd do something like cross
[SPEAKER_02]: the chem dog to another suitable male have
a male from that generation work back to
[SPEAKER_02]: the Cinderella 99 and then see how those
heavy Indica influences can combine with
[SPEAKER_02]: the Cinderella 99 there are people I'll
just give you a little heads up to we
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't do it ourselves but out on the west
coast there are some folks who grew out
[SPEAKER_02]: Cinderella 99 crossed to some very heavy
like OG Kush type and they said Cinderella
[SPEAKER_02]: 99 was so dominant that you would have
thought that that Indica would be showing
[SPEAKER_02]: its stuff in in that next generation but
they were mostly Cinderella 99 dominant so
[SPEAKER_02]: that's interesting you know and I'd like
to you know see how that plays out for us
[SPEAKER_02]: as well
[SPEAKER_03]: so kind of just on the topic of feminized
seeds would you ever consider crossing
[SPEAKER_03]: princess to genius seeing as a lot of
people including myself consider these two
[SPEAKER_03]: to be kind of you know the brothers room
holy grails but as I mentioned to Tommy
[SPEAKER_03]: the other day he said oh I don't think it
would be too different to Apollo yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah we kind of did tie them together in a
nice way Apollo 11 in particular was the
[SPEAKER_02]: goal all along to do that sort of a
combination never having thought about or
[SPEAKER_02]: wanting to you know engage in this
reversing the plants so yeah Apollo 11 has
[SPEAKER_02]: that princess structure with the more
vertically angled branches and denser
[SPEAKER_02]: structure at the same time looks a lot
like genius and veg at the time when the
[SPEAKER_02]: buds are fully formed they have a lot of
the shape of the of the princess and at
[SPEAKER_02]: the same time are much frostier have a lot
of resin a lighter looking than either
[SPEAKER_02]: genius or princess so I felt like it
really brought the two together and the
[SPEAKER_02]: flavors and the high and everything or it
is kind of like best of both worlds there
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah well I guess the reason why I bring
that up is because as you were just
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioning with the Cinderella dominating
that OG cross your friends had made it
[SPEAKER_03]: does feel somewhat the same with the
Apollo and I guess we attribute that to
[SPEAKER_03]: the true breeding nature of Sydney is
going to tend to be more dominant yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: just like when we were using the example
of the land race yeah across to a poly
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrid you know she kind of comes from
that so do you think you see 99 is
[SPEAKER_02]: stabilized enough that making predictable
contributions each time so do you think if
[SPEAKER_03]: you did do a feminized of princess and
genius it would come out more different to
[SPEAKER_03]: Apollo seeing as there isn't that
dominating nature you know like princess
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't as dominating as Sydney necessarily
huh that's yeah it's likely that you'd be
[SPEAKER_03]: you'd be seeing more variety interesting
so you referenced earlier on that the
[SPEAKER_03]: brothers Grimm do everything organically
what's your thoughts behind this is it
[SPEAKER_03]: just simply a preferred grow style or do
you really think it's you know I am really
[SPEAKER_02]: a pragmatic guy I wouldn't be doing this
for any other reason than I find it to be
[SPEAKER_02]: giving me the best results with the least
effort and you know there's going back to
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier conversation we mentioned you know
beginners getting kind of carried away you
[SPEAKER_02]: know always making mistakes on the high
side of overdoing things well there's also
[SPEAKER_02]: what I call the gee whiz factor and when
you first come into learning about
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis cultivation you kind of go gee
whiz that's cool about a lot of things
[SPEAKER_02]: that are beyond your present skills and
abilities and may not actually be the
[SPEAKER_02]: better way of doing things anyway but I
know that setting up an automated room
[SPEAKER_02]: with all hydroponics and co2 and lights
that you know are on crazy cycles that you
[SPEAKER_02]: read about somewhere and you know these
are the kinds of things that the early
[SPEAKER_02]: guys jump into sometimes and what was the
question so they get carried away but they
[SPEAKER_02]: get carried away and I did too I guess in
the beginning and wanted to do hydroponics
[SPEAKER_02]: and I so I have dabbled in that and did it
even during the time when I was doing
[SPEAKER_02]: Brothers Grimm in Boston I had sort of
pebble bed draining tables with rock wool
[SPEAKER_02]: cubes lying on top of them and then you
had to stabilize the top of the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: with them screening or stakes or however
you can manage to do it I was stretching
[SPEAKER_02]: strings across the room and making kind of
a grid to let them stand inside of it so
[SPEAKER_02]: to cap off and answer the question fully
it's just the fact that I find super easy
[SPEAKER_02]: seems so natural maybe there's no gee whiz
factor to it but I get my hands right in
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil and I mix it up you can ask Tommy
he says I'm the best soil mixer he's ever
[SPEAKER_02]: seen in his life but every grain of soil
is like evenly mixed and evenly moist you
[SPEAKER_02]: know and that's and that and I'm touching
that with my bare hands and getting that
[SPEAKER_02]: soil ready and when I transplant something
into that pot it's just takes off like a
[SPEAKER_02]: jet plane or something and I love that
every time I never tire of seeing I think
[SPEAKER_02]: transplanting is one of my favorite things
to do I love taking them from the smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: pot and putting them in that big final pot
and watching how there's a room behind you
[SPEAKER_02]: right there where I was remarking to
myself only 15 minutes ago how this room
[SPEAKER_02]: just really they really just jump right up
out of the soil in a very short time and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's they're just growing like mad so I
love that process and working with the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil moving a few pots around mixing soil
doesn't bother me in the least I enjoy it
[SPEAKER_02]: and I feel like we get great yields and
great productivity doesn't slow us down at
[SPEAKER_02]: all yes there's some bother to you know
going around hand feeding soil plants with
[SPEAKER_02]: a wand of whatever food we're we're giving
them that day which is all dragonfly earth
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine mixed into water and pH balanced
and such coconut water and all that stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah you know we have mixed our own soil
and we're also feeding with those types of
[SPEAKER_02]: products and to me it just seems really
simple you know we can do a lot of by feel
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the kind of the by feel person I guess
so touching back on something you
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned at the very start of the
interview you said you had the Akpuko gold
[SPEAKER_03]: and recently some tests were done on some
samples they found and they found it that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's still was fairly high in THC do you
think that could attest to that yeah so do
[SPEAKER_03]: you think that modern cannabis has
improved the levels of THC or more so just
[SPEAKER_03]: refined characteristics about the high
because I think a lot of people and I used
[SPEAKER_03]: to be guilty of this think that you know
all the Akpuko gold for example was maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: not very good and it's through hybridizing
cannabis that we've got it to the THC
[SPEAKER_03]: point it is now do you feel that that's
maybe not necessarily the truth I think in
[SPEAKER_02]: those days in the 60s and 70s those fields
were grown not by people who are really
[SPEAKER_02]: consciously cultivating them the way we
are now and that there were standout
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and you got certain batches you
know in those days from your local dealer
[SPEAKER_02]: and he had gotten a pound that happened to
be better than usual or something and so
[SPEAKER_02]: you got some outstanding ones and you
probably got some mediocre ones but that's
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just the variation I think in the in
that but certainly there had to have been
[SPEAKER_02]: very high THC content and very potent
plants coming from that region during that
[SPEAKER_02]: time and people having stood on that
shoulder and bred from there could
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely improve it and I feel that
maybe the advantages one has today are
[SPEAKER_02]: that you have this variety available to
you very easily and there's been a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: experimentation and people have created
information and written and spoken on all
[SPEAKER_02]: these subjects so that today with the
instant information of the internet you're
[SPEAKER_02]: well informed about what the different
types of marijuana might do and which ones
[SPEAKER_02]: you might like and how to get them and
which ones taste the way you want them to
[SPEAKER_02]: taste and you know so many more refined
menu I guess you could say you know you
[SPEAKER_02]: can build build your own what you like to
smoke based on the information that's out
[SPEAKER_02]: there and a little bit of sampling but in
those days it was like whatever was around
[SPEAKER_02]: that week or you know happened to be
circulating through your neighborhood or
[SPEAKER_02]: your school that's what you got and it's
kind of hard to compare the apples to
[SPEAKER_02]: oranges you know you just look back on it
and there's a nostalgia too that every
[SPEAKER_02]: human being I think suffers from you today
have a lot of resistance to you know
[SPEAKER_02]: you're building up resistance and people
have high tolerances to marijuana that we
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't have in those days that it used a
lot of times periods of time would pass
[SPEAKER_02]: that there was nothing around and then
when you did finally get some wow you know
[SPEAKER_02]: knock you on your ass and you'd be talking
about how great that weed was and is it
[SPEAKER_02]: really psychological or was it really
pharmaceutical you know in in origin you
[SPEAKER_02]: know the feelings and sensations that you
had I remember having not smoked marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: after marrying that woman who I told you
made me give it all up and I had gotten a
[SPEAKER_02]: project as an engineer working on a
project in Scotland and it was 1991 and as
[SPEAKER_02]: part of my job I was required to just make
a quick trip out of the UK and fly back in
[SPEAKER_02]: with my paperwork in order because when
they first called me and it was an
[SPEAKER_02]: emergency and I had to get there and they
put me in as a tourist you know so I took
[SPEAKER_02]: the opportunity to go to Amsterdam you
know and turn around at Schiphol and go
[SPEAKER_02]: back to wherever Edinburgh and while there
of course I went in a coffee shop and the
[SPEAKER_02]: first thing I ordered was skunk number one
because at that time 1991 that was
[SPEAKER_02]: something that was like highly touted
strain that everyone should try and I had
[SPEAKER_02]: been growing it at home and you know going
in a coffee shop in Amsterdam and actually
[SPEAKER_02]: trying it there was something I really
wanted to do but my point is that having
[SPEAKER_02]: not smoked for so long and my tolerance
being so low and having been living this
[SPEAKER_02]: really straight life with my wife and you
know was like a huge freak out that almost
[SPEAKER_02]: was akin to that first time I got high
with my uncle in his backyard and came
[SPEAKER_02]: back in the house and felt like I was in a
dream you know and then my grandmother
[SPEAKER_02]: came home and made a soup and we were
sitting at the table and I couldn't stop
[SPEAKER_02]: giggling and my uncle is like kicking me
under the table stop giggling your
[SPEAKER_02]: grandmother's gonna think something's
wrong you know and so when I went into
[SPEAKER_02]: that coffee shop after having not gotten
high for so long I remember that skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: number one just made me feel like oh my
god I'm seeing all these incredible visual
[SPEAKER_02]: things around here like if I had a camera
right now that would be such a cool shot
[SPEAKER_02]: you know the the floor and the way it goes
into the jukebox over there that way and
[SPEAKER_02]: so on so I mean there is some subjectivity
and some you have to pay attention to two
[SPEAKER_02]: things the subjectivity of the set and
setting of the people who are smoking the
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana and judging how great it is
where are they coming from before they get
[SPEAKER_02]: there you know and then in that same vein
what was their tolerance you know what are
[SPEAKER_02]: they used to smoking all the time that can
totally change a review you know I would
[SPEAKER_02]: do yeah I mean if I hadn't smoked
marijuana for a month been out hiking in
[SPEAKER_02]: mountains drinking from streams and you
know living off the land and having this
[SPEAKER_02]: pure life or whatever and came back to you
know here and everybody say I welcome back
[SPEAKER_02]: you know hey let's all smoke something
that first joint would be yeah man stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that I didn't think was that strong before
would probably knock me on my ass so take
[SPEAKER_02]: those things into consideration and also
you know kind of reminds me that cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: cup competitions and such are oftentimes
very subjective and I don't put a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: stock in okay that strain one this time
who knows who that may have been three or
[SPEAKER_02]: four other ones that I would have
preferred better you know yeah so so if we
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of keep on that topic of tolerance
there's a bit of a kind of a trend in the
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding community to quote-unquote breed
for concentrates you know breeding for
[SPEAKER_03]: terpings that will translate to
concentrates all of this type of
[SPEAKER_03]: generalization I would like to say that we
have something already that maybe it isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: even recognized or appreciated or or
people aren't aware of it that Cinderella
[SPEAKER_02]: 99 itself it just completely dumps huge
amounts of resin off of the buds and if I
[SPEAKER_02]: understand well how that whole process
works with extracts the more the resin you
[SPEAKER_02]: know that comes off the bud you the more
what do they call yield of concentrate
[SPEAKER_02]: that that particular strain would be rated
at say you know I think that if someone
[SPEAKER_02]: did a good grow of Cinderella 99 and then
were to process it and do extraction they
[SPEAKER_02]: may find that it's hitting numbers for
yield that are unprecedented you know I
[SPEAKER_02]: just don't think anybody's tried yet you
know we released the seeds in April enough
[SPEAKER_02]: time past that somebody should have done
but maybe nobody has or anybody hasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: stuck their head up out of the rabbit hole
and told anybody about it you know yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: but I would feel I would like to say you
know if there are people who want to buy
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and grow a plant that will give you
a high yield of high quality you couldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: go wrong buying the Cinderella 99 and just
saying you know this will give a an
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing terpene profile it's gonna give an
amazing yield of resin and it's gonna have
[SPEAKER_02]: a psychoactivity that you know is world
famous for you know really being enjoyable
[SPEAKER_02]: and the kind of thing that like the ladies
for some reason I have many time women
[SPEAKER_02]: come up to Cinderella 99 is my favorite
strain I just love that this tastes so
[SPEAKER_02]: good makes me feel so good and so on yeah
exactly and it's funny you say that
[SPEAKER_02]: because I was just about to segue into
Fourier is this spray for you know it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: sexual lubricant actually with cannabis
infused in it and one of my girlfriends
[SPEAKER_02]: told me that she read somewhere that
Cinderella 99 is used in that formula
[SPEAKER_02]: because of the aphrodisiac qualities that
they found in testing other strains and it
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah so I did not see that with my own
eyes but I'd like to believe it's true
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah I remember I was talking to Duke the
other day in regards to the hash making
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff and he said that Cindy is like the
never-ending god stopper it just just
[SPEAKER_03]: keeps giving you more resin the more you
handle it it's crazy so you guys are
[SPEAKER_03]: looking to re-release the killer Queen
slash you have yeah out now yeah so it's
[SPEAKER_03]: out there go get it can we expect any
other little special reduxes from some of
[SPEAKER_03]: these old-school popular strains to make
it out there let me think about something
[SPEAKER_02]: we were probably kicking around recently
let's see there was something that crossed
[SPEAKER_02]: my mind I forget what it was like a sugar
blossoms or something where yeah using a
[SPEAKER_02]: white widow c99 white widow type of a
thing would probably be the recreation of
[SPEAKER_02]: what we called sugar blossoms back then we
also have talked a little bit about there
[SPEAKER_02]: was a plant we called the green giant back
in the day and we're sort of working
[SPEAKER_02]: toward a similar thing we were probably
won't call it green giant but it's an
[SPEAKER_02]: improvement on that idea that now having
stood on the shoulders of previous work I
[SPEAKER_02]: can see that we can do even better and
we'll do some you know big yielding
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor strain that you know can still
mature in time for the northeasterners
[SPEAKER_02]: here in the United States and such where
in Australia do you have sort of a
[SPEAKER_02]: dividing line of where people can start to
be getting too far south where it's too
[SPEAKER_02]: cold in the winters or something or does
not not happen in Australia at all I know
[SPEAKER_03]: people in New Zealand and they still are
able to do outdoor crops so I don't think
[SPEAKER_03]: there is a too far south so to speak
around there's you know like I I struggle
[SPEAKER_03]: like I kind of cringe to say but there's
an area in Australia called there the
[SPEAKER_03]: Emerald Triangle you know akin to the one
here and that's kind of what I consider to
[SPEAKER_03]: be a sweet spot of Australia to be growing
it outdoors and they get like three four
[SPEAKER_03]: crops in an outdoor season because it goes
for quite a long time I guess so is the
[SPEAKER_02]: daylight sort of not varying so much from
12 12 yeah yeah very close very close so I
[SPEAKER_03]: think we get about 14 hours max sorry 14
hours max 11 and a half minimum so yeah we
[SPEAKER_03]: we get um basically from speaking to my
friend who does a lot of outdoor he says
[SPEAKER_03]: so they're their first outdoor crops are
just starting to flower right now and
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll be harvested a little bit after
Christmas he said those crops don't turn
[SPEAKER_03]: out the best because it's still really hot
it's summer you know it's like 100 degrees
[SPEAKER_03]: but resin production is yeah destroyed by
the heat no density and then he said but
[SPEAKER_03]: the last two you get in which are as
you're just getting towards July they're
[SPEAKER_03]: really frosty nice colors because you're
getting towards winter and yeah I look
[SPEAKER_03]: forward to those our autumn is also
similar so obviously you have a bit of an
[SPEAKER_03]: intertwined past with the SSFC yeah being
the US distributor when you decided to do
[SPEAKER_03]: the Durban Thai Cindy 99 did they kind of
give you you know a note of approval as a
[SPEAKER_03]: thank you for the help earlier or were you
not really in contact with them lost
[SPEAKER_02]: contact for some time at that point I
hadn't spoken to them for something like
[SPEAKER_02]: eight years and they were a set with me
for giving up working for them you know
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was sort of abrupt because of
having met that woman and get married and
[SPEAKER_02]: so on I was a young man and easily swayed
by you know yeah you know there were some
[SPEAKER_02]: urgency I don't know sort of primal
pressure to breed or something at that
[SPEAKER_02]: moment you know myself so I took five
years and made a couple of kids and came
[SPEAKER_02]: back to making plants again now you've
made thousands yeah so when you did that
[SPEAKER_03]: they were still releasing the original
Durban Thai high flyer or did you track
[SPEAKER_02]: down a packet of it or oh no yeah that was
actually a friend out in the North Pacific
[SPEAKER_02]: Northwest who I traded a cutting of
princess to who gave me the Durban Thai
[SPEAKER_02]: and he was meant to keep that under wraps
and not spread it around and I believe he
[SPEAKER_02]: has done I know I think it may have
circulated to another fellow but so from
[SPEAKER_02]: that friend who I traded the princess
clone to and he gave me Durban Thai as
[SPEAKER_02]: seed and I grew out those seeds and having
done many years before I knew what to look
[SPEAKER_02]: for and found a really nice early maturing
little group there and got the mail that
[SPEAKER_02]: was similar to that and read that to oh
I'm sorry I use the female and use the
[SPEAKER_02]: email the male c99 on that that's right so
and so I got the Durban Thai c99 I found a
[SPEAKER_02]: nice early maturing female and went with a
c99 male so do you have any beliefs on the
[SPEAKER_03]: effects of using males and females and the
differences in the cross so what I mean by
[SPEAKER_03]: that is I from memory I'm quoting this DJ
short said that he always found you wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: to have the most sativa of the two parents
being the female I think he said he got
[SPEAKER_03]: the best results from that have you found
something like that where you know like
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe you prefer to use Cindy as a male
more than a female or you know anything
[SPEAKER_02]: along those lines well here's the thing
that's funny you asked that question and
[SPEAKER_02]: after all this time it was that question
that I asked to super sativa seed club
[SPEAKER_02]: that piqued their interest in me and made
them think with this guy actually is
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking and has a good understanding of
what what's going on with breeding and so
[SPEAKER_02]: on because I asked them the question when
you make a cross like you know Afghani
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk skunk Afghani you know does it
matter the offspring whether the male was
[SPEAKER_02]: the Afghani or the female was the Afghani
or vice versa the males skunk or the
[SPEAKER_02]: female skunk and so he said because of
that question I really want to talk to you
[SPEAKER_02]: can I get your phone number and stuff and
in my experience he never did answer you
[SPEAKER_02]: know to my satisfaction in any thing but
in my experience now after all these years
[SPEAKER_02]: I've found that what you want to do is
that the offspring are presumably female
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're interested in if we can just
like assume that let's say you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow seeds that will give you a great
female in general you want the mother to
[SPEAKER_02]: be the type that's most like the offspring
you're looking for and the male will be
[SPEAKER_02]: less in less of an influence because of
the following reason daughters are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to look more like their mothers in general
and their feminine qualities will come
[SPEAKER_02]: from the mother more likely and the male
contributes a Y chromosome X chromosome
[SPEAKER_02]: and the female contributes an X chromosome
so each of them is contributing something
[SPEAKER_02]: to make up that female daughter and when a
son is created it has the Y chromosome
[SPEAKER_02]: from the male and therefore you know has
his influence and being his sons you tend
[SPEAKER_02]: to see sons looking like their dads and
such in human beings and mammals and so on
[SPEAKER_02]: and also when you are trying to breed a
female you're looking for the female
[SPEAKER_02]: traits to show you what the daughters will
have and it's obvious right I mean because
[SPEAKER_02]: if the mother's a female the daughter's a
female the traits those female traits that
[SPEAKER_02]: you want the daughters to have are going
to be expressed in the female hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: and if you're hoping to get some of the
female traits from the male side it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be a subtler influence but you
know what will end up happening
[SPEAKER_02]: also how does one pick in the phenotype of
a male and judge what female traits he'll
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to contribute when he has no
feminine traits to exhibit now one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: examples I use is imagine you wanted to
breed humans you know you want you wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: to have large breasted women okay and it'd
be obvious that yeah you would want to
[SPEAKER_02]: start with take a woman who's large
breasted she'll probably have large
[SPEAKER_02]: breasted daughters now if you make that
link to potency and marijuana and you say
[SPEAKER_02]: all right well we're gonna want a female
that has high potency right you know and
[SPEAKER_02]: potency comes from high resin production
and the female parts of the marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: plant so it's very obvious to be able to
pick a female that has the drug quality
[SPEAKER_02]: that you want but in the male he doesn't
have any female parts to judge that from
[SPEAKER_02]: so what do you do guys in the old days
would do the following they would try to
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke the males leaves and flowers and try
to find out which males had the highest
[SPEAKER_02]: potency and figure that would be the one
that will give the female more potency and
[SPEAKER_02]: bring that into the cross well if you
think about it that's analogous to in our
[SPEAKER_02]: little example of trying to breed for
large breasted women finding men with
[SPEAKER_02]: large breasts to breed with your large
breasted woman that doesn't make sense
[SPEAKER_02]: does it yeah because you're looking for a
feminine trait in a male yeah that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily going to happen that the man
whose breasts are the largest are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be a trait that he transmits to his
daughter he might more likely have large
[SPEAKER_02]: breasted sons so that's the fucked up
thing about doing it that way so what I
[SPEAKER_02]: found was that I would grow out a
generation of plants and I'd have the
[SPEAKER_02]: females and males growing through their
vegetative states together and I'd group
[SPEAKER_02]: the ones that were similar in their
structure you know given all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: neutral gender traits stuff that's not
specific to a male or a female thickness
[SPEAKER_02]: of the stalk density of the internodes and
the thinness or longness of the leaves and
[SPEAKER_02]: such and group them together and whichever
ones turned out to be females and males
[SPEAKER_02]: from each group I'd say okay the males
from that group that had all of those
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetative properties that were similar to
the females in that group be it you know
[SPEAKER_02]: tall short whatever I have found that they
are the ones that will then transmit the
[SPEAKER_02]: type of female characteristics from the
sisters to the next generation and if you
[SPEAKER_02]: do a little bit of reverse engineering and
sort of time traveling you can go back to
[SPEAKER_02]: our experiment with humans and say okay
how do we know a man who has already
[SPEAKER_02]: proven himself to create daughters who
have large breasts that would be one way
[SPEAKER_02]: of finding a man who is a good match for
your bit large breasted woman right
[SPEAKER_02]: because the proofs in the pudding it's not
in his breasts that he just that he
[SPEAKER_02]: exhibits on himself the real test of a
breeding stud of a guy who can make
[SPEAKER_02]: daughters who have large breasts is a guy
who makes daughters with large breasts
[SPEAKER_02]: you've proven it he's done it a few times
right so you know how you find guys like
[SPEAKER_02]: that find large breasted women and get
their dad so you go back to the father of
[SPEAKER_02]: that large breasted woman yeah that guy
already has been shown to make a large
[SPEAKER_02]: breasted daughter he's a good probability
so you can do that if anyone is ever smart
[SPEAKER_02]: enough to you know hold the mail back and
see what happens in future generations say
[SPEAKER_02]: oh fuck you know that mail would have been
very really you know valuable but we
[SPEAKER_02]: called him because you know we already
pollinated something with it once you know
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes people do that but we tend to
hold on to our males for a while and prove
[SPEAKER_03]: them out before we would ever so with this
in mind is that almost does that school of
[SPEAKER_03]: thought almost lean itself to make you
want to use Cindy more as the male because
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah if you read there are strains you
could look at for example it's
[SPEAKER_03]: straightaway say oh well Cindy was the dad
like I mean Space Queen's a great one well
[SPEAKER_02]: you're talking feminized now and when you
feminize and reverse a female clone I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: it's almost a certainty that this will now
was space queen feminized no I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about I'm just saying in general
yeah not using Space Queen as the example
[SPEAKER_02]: but if you take a clone female clone and
colloidal silver spray the thing to
[SPEAKER_02]: reverse it make pollen the characteristics
that are going to be carried in that
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen is much much more likely to carry
all of the feminine characteristics of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant that it came from then a male who
came from that generation and may have an
[SPEAKER_02]: entirely different lottery ticket as we
were using that analogy earlier and
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't give so reliably all of the
characteristics that that female clone
[SPEAKER_02]: would have done in its pollen that would
be my assumption going into this and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what you know scientifically makes
sense to me but again proofs in the
[SPEAKER_02]: pudding yeah in the next year or so as we
go through the process of learning how
[SPEAKER_02]: that works for us I will like to think
that that will ring true eventually but
[SPEAKER_03]: that's my gut feeling yeah so do you have
any plans or want to do any kind of CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: project of your own it's so ubiquitous at
the moment that people ask for the CBD and
[SPEAKER_02]: ask if we're doing anything and I mean
I've always just felt ah you know I'm an
[SPEAKER_02]: old-school guy I'm a stuck stick in the
mud or whatever I'm in this for the THC
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about you know smoking marijuana
for the pleasurable recreational value of
[SPEAKER_02]: it I know that it helps people you know on
the medical side and my partner's Dukes
[SPEAKER_02]: much more into that side of it and good
you know there should be one part of this
[SPEAKER_02]: company that wants to devote you know
energy to that but and I will certainly go
[SPEAKER_02]: along with anything we come up with the he
wants to do but it's not a big concern for
[SPEAKER_02]: me or a priority for me for some reason I
don't know I guess I need more experience
[SPEAKER_02]: with it I did have one nice experience
where I had come from New York to Colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: and had a dodgy knee for a while and it
had been sort of like a tendonitis that
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't just from recently I mean I'd been
suffering for a while and somebody gave me
[SPEAKER_02]: some CBD pills I think they were 30
milligrams of CBD oil and took one or two
[SPEAKER_02]: of them went away never came back I've
never still to this day had that
[SPEAKER_02]: tendonitis ever come back so I feel like
the stuff is pretty miraculous in the way
[SPEAKER_02]: that it can work and I'd love to have
people also experience you know really
[SPEAKER_02]: good result like that like I did yeah and
so I'd love to get my hands on some more
[SPEAKER_02]: there's one fellow who I did get that from
that I'd kind of like to see again and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put the word out to him soon that
come see me with more of those CBD pills
[SPEAKER_03]: man my wife is asking about a man yeah for
sure so do you feel that the true medicine
[SPEAKER_03]: well when I say true it's obviously
subjective but do you feel that you know
[SPEAKER_03]: the largest amount of conditions are
treated by not simply CBD but a mixture of
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe THC and CBD yeah I've always
maintained that it's the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: profile itself and the ratios of the
different cannabinoids that go into any
[SPEAKER_02]: one plant that give it all of its myriad
qualities of different high flavors and so
[SPEAKER_02]: on and the high you're getting is
influenced by that you know almost like a
[SPEAKER_02]: chord being played on an instrument that
it's you know first third fifth you know
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe it's got a minor seventh thrown into
it and these kinds of things and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: all subtle things it's always amazed me in
music how with 12 notes you know that
[SPEAKER_02]: everything can just be created that is
created from that and it's the same thing
[SPEAKER_03]: with the marijuana yeah so if you could
give some advice to some of the breeders
[SPEAKER_03]: starting out what would be some of the
things you try to emphasize as you know
[SPEAKER_02]: the more important things to be keeping in
mind I'd say you know there's a tendency
[SPEAKER_02]: to want to try a lot of different things
and bring a lot of elements and there's
[SPEAKER_02]: the old adage you know too many cook spoil
the soup or you know adding too many
[SPEAKER_02]: ingredients is you know keep it simple the
kiss method of you know know what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: working with and realize that you don't
really necessarily need to have any wild
[SPEAKER_02]: swings in variation of what you're
breeding to start moving your phenotypes
[SPEAKER_02]: toward the phenotype that you really want
you know I've gotten such a good lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: variation from such similar plants that
you know imagine you know they're only
[SPEAKER_02]: sister they're actually sisters of each
other genius and princess and the
[SPEAKER_02]: different things that have been created
out of them can show you how from very
[SPEAKER_02]: little variation and the gene pool you're
starting from you can achieve what you
[SPEAKER_02]: want and you don't have to overshoot by
introducing more elements than necessary
[SPEAKER_02]: or too too great of a difference in where
you are to what you're crossing it to so
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping it simple always be sure of what
you're actually what you really have you
[SPEAKER_02]: know never take something from somebody
and trust that they say it's what it is
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm you know I believe them you know
really do your diligence and make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that it is what the person says it is I
can't tell you how many times I've turned
[SPEAKER_02]: down people offering me cuttings and seeds
and anything else and I just say dude you
[SPEAKER_02]: know thank you for your generosity it's
very nice of you to offer to send me free
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff and you know I just don't
philosophically fit into the kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder who tries a bunch of odd shit you
know I have very definite idea of where
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going with something I know I already
have the tools in my tool kit here I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: need to reach outside too much when I do
it's for a really specific reason it's
[SPEAKER_02]: something that I think like okay that
really makes sense and I really know that
[SPEAKER_02]: this is what it's supposed to be and I'll
take it from there and I would advocate
[SPEAKER_02]: that people be a little bit more choosy I
guess you know and ask yourself when you
[SPEAKER_02]: do buy seeds and you know to have to have
a starting point what am I really looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for what characteristics do I desire in
the plants that I want to grow is there
[SPEAKER_02]: anything that already exists that does all
that and you know matches up to my wish
[SPEAKER_02]: list why don't I try buying some of those
seeds and if they aren't exactly what I
[SPEAKER_02]: want isn't that a great place to start
your breeding project with something that
[SPEAKER_02]: was geez you know touted to be what I
really want and it wasn't quite what I
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted but if I were to breed it a couple
of generations do some back-crossing maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have something here but you know
choose a good starting point no I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know so yeah so with that same kind of
thought in mind how do you feel about
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders using your work and more
specifically I'll give you a few examples
[SPEAKER_03]: how do you feel about a breeder using one
of your strains in an f1 how do you feel
[SPEAKER_03]: about a breeder selling say not Cindy
because you understand why but maybe say
[SPEAKER_03]: the Apollo in just say the pure f4 for and
how do you feel about someone selling a
[SPEAKER_03]: cross that maybe they've made with an f1
Cindy but then taken to the f4 as opposed
[SPEAKER_02]: to just a pure Apollo taken to the m4 I
feel that it's always a compliment
[SPEAKER_02]: whenever anybody uses Brothers Grimm seed
stock and creates something from it if
[SPEAKER_02]: they've taken Apollo 13 to f4 and it's
done intelligently I mean it's another
[SPEAKER_02]: thing that I think that newbies don't
understand is that they think maybe a
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger number means better you know like a
four-star general is you know has more
[SPEAKER_02]: higher rank than a three-star general in a
f4 is better than an f3 well that may be
[SPEAKER_02]: only if the steps along the way from f1 to
f2 to f2 to f3 and so on were done
[SPEAKER_02]: intelligently and correctly then yeah you
are improving in each generation but just
[SPEAKER_02]: don't go by the number as long as people
understand what that all means and I know
[SPEAKER_02]: that you know the general public probably
doesn't to a large degree understand the
[SPEAKER_02]: terminology and what they're really buying
and so on so you won't be able to reach
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody but you're asking for advice to
people who are in the know and would know
[SPEAKER_02]: better and so on and my advice is yeah I
know I had a good point going there don't
[SPEAKER_02]: let me lose it what was the question again
oh you how they how I feel about them
[SPEAKER_02]: using my stuff so it's a compliment that
they do that the people who are the buyers
[SPEAKER_02]: are probably not savvy enough to really in
any great numbers differentiate you know
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going on there but I believe that
it'll all sort of settle to a common
[SPEAKER_02]: denominator where everyone no matter who
you are whether you're buying soap or
[SPEAKER_02]: electronics or whatever it is you don't
buy the knockoff you buy the real thing if
[SPEAKER_02]: you know it exists it's and it's available
and there's no real price difference to
[SPEAKER_02]: consider you go with the name brand you
know and the originator of Cinderella 99
[SPEAKER_02]: is Brothers Grimm so if someone were doing
a knockoff Cinderella 99 two things come
[SPEAKER_02]: to mind about that you know for the
present I think of it as well the guy
[SPEAKER_02]: who's doing that is probably at this point
gonna want to just either sell out all of
[SPEAKER_02]: his stock or realize that it's sort of
worthless because only somebody who's not
[SPEAKER_02]: in the know and doesn't realize that they
could get the real thing would even want
[SPEAKER_02]: to buy that so should probably have a fire
sale and just get rid of as much of it as
[SPEAKER_02]: he can as freebies for buying you know
here's a promotional pack of our knockoff
[SPEAKER_02]: C99 that you is free with anything we sell
you know and get rid of it because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like stock that has suddenly dropped to
zero value that you're holding on to you
[SPEAKER_02]: might as well get rid of it right so
there's the present that's the present
[SPEAKER_02]: situation but the past that led up to the
present if you think about it none of
[SPEAKER_02]: these guys ever played with Cinderella 99
made crosses with it and Apollo's and the
[SPEAKER_02]: names weren't bandied about for this last
dozen years and I come back into the
[SPEAKER_02]: business where would I be I'd be sitting
here trying to remind everybody who the
[SPEAKER_02]: hell I was what my strains were you know
the so they actually kept the buzz alive
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm complimented by the fact that they
were so you know driven to continue in our
[SPEAKER_02]: absence the the work if you will I've only
tried a couple of people's knockoffs and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know obviously something went awry
somewhere they got something from somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: who claimed that it was C99 it wasn't or
something because the plants that I've
[SPEAKER_02]: seen that were grown from the seeds that
I've been given by the knockoff companies
[SPEAKER_02]: just don't come out looking like
Cinderella 99 or anything you know it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not really even close so yeah and that
happens it's like the story that is told
[SPEAKER_02]: at one end of the classroom gets to the
other end of the classroom and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: totally different from where it started
and you can imagine in the 14 years that
[SPEAKER_02]: it took to go from shutting down in 2002
and coming back up in 2016 now that story
[SPEAKER_02]: has gone all around and upside down and
who knows what's what anymore so push now
[SPEAKER_02]: push the reset button then you can obtain
the original strains from the original
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder and you know easy now too you know
we're internationally distributed
[SPEAKER_03]: worldwide it's easy to get no more
complaining so there seems to be a current
[SPEAKER_03]: fad in the breeding community for people
wanting to take things to like say the f2
[SPEAKER_03]: or the f3 as opposed to say doing a bx2 or
a bx3 how do you think these two
[SPEAKER_03]: techniques compare to each other they've
obviously got these different reasons why
[SPEAKER_03]: you should do them but I'm of the opinion
that maybe some people just do it because
[SPEAKER_03]: it seems like they've put in a lot of work
or something like that like how do you
[SPEAKER_02]: feel no you know I'd say exceptional
people are in the minority by definition
[SPEAKER_02]: right I mean the average person is
probably gonna make a lot of mistakes and
[SPEAKER_02]: do a lot of guesswork and say well maybe
this will you know they don't have a rhyme
[SPEAKER_02]: or reason for what they're doing so that's
a major fault right there but then when
[SPEAKER_02]: people are intelligent about their choices
and they say okay what am I doing here and
[SPEAKER_02]: they ask all these questions that I always
advocate you ask yourself like you know
[SPEAKER_02]: what is it that I really want in my ideal
plant where am I going with this what's
[SPEAKER_02]: the end what's the end goal and
traditionally you had this crossing of one
[SPEAKER_02]: landrace to another and so you'd have your
p1 generation these two landrace strains
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you create a hybrid from that an
f1 generation now in that f1 generation
[SPEAKER_02]: you're gonna see a certain ratio that
everybody's familiar with one three one
[SPEAKER_02]: and you then decide if you were crossing
these two to start with neither one of
[SPEAKER_02]: them p1 generation parents was the ideal
plant right but must have had some
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristics that you felt were
important and the other one did too and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's why you're bringing them together
otherwise you would have just stayed with
[SPEAKER_02]: either one of those plants and said hey
I'm happy with these what's the point of
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to yeah improve on something that I
feels are already perfect yeah so you're
[SPEAKER_02]: constantly asking yourself where are we
going why am I doing this what is it that
[SPEAKER_02]: I what are my goals and if back crossing
comes into play it's because one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: two parents is heavily care is carrying
heavily many of the characteristics that
[SPEAKER_02]: you are trying to go for in the goal and
the other one was contributing for some
[SPEAKER_02]: minor reason okay but if they're sort of
equally contributing there's not much
[SPEAKER_02]: reason to back cross but then you start
looking at that larger group that came
[SPEAKER_02]: from the f1 generation that has the
variations in it that isn't the oh these
[SPEAKER_02]: are just you know clones of the mom this
is just the clones of dad you know that
[SPEAKER_02]: that jet that part that proportion of your
progeny that falls into that category and
[SPEAKER_02]: you concentrate on the ones that varied
and are some mix of the two because isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: that what you're going for right you're
looking to mix them and blend them in some
[SPEAKER_02]: way but it doesn't always work like a
blender but in the f1 generation that
[SPEAKER_02]: larger population is generally like a
blender so there is a great tendency for
[SPEAKER_02]: them to be an equal balance of the two and
if that's what you're going for you've
[SPEAKER_02]: already arrived you've got the pack of
seeds that you just keep crossing that
[SPEAKER_02]: mother and father ad infinitum and why go
any further is there a reason to create an
[SPEAKER_02]: f2 or three or four no nowhere the end
goal is and stop there so what's
[SPEAKER_02]: presumably from that f1 generation the
person who looks to make an f2 generation
[SPEAKER_02]: is saying i see a phenotype in here that i
want to isolate and then further refine in
[SPEAKER_02]: the next generation such that more of the
progeny are of that type yeah yeah so you
[SPEAKER_02]: have to intelligently choose the f1s that
you're going to use to make your f2
[SPEAKER_02]: generation maybe do it with several of the
brothers in sister so you have a few
[SPEAKER_02]: different groups to try to see ah now i'm
starting to see a rhyme or a reason here
[SPEAKER_02]: which ones actually do what i want to do
then you intelligently choose from them
[SPEAKER_02]: how to make your f3 generation if that
isn't where you really wanted to go yet
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you're looking for stability are
we starting to get now all the females are
[SPEAKER_02]: alike you know and they all have the great
qualities that i want you know and those
[SPEAKER_02]: are the reasons to accept the challenge of
going one more generation and trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: find the right mothers and fathers to give
you that seed that you can throw in the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground and reliably say i know what i'm
going to get here every time if that's
[SPEAKER_02]: your goal okay but yeah i mean that's
that's how an intelligent breeder goes
[SPEAKER_02]: about working toward creating a strain or
getting a plan and i think that listening
[SPEAKER_02]: to going back if you rewind through this
and you see how starting from a and b
[SPEAKER_02]: mother and father blending them together
and having a goal and asking yourself in
[SPEAKER_02]: each generation am i getting there and
what am i doing right or wrong and
[SPEAKER_02]: adjusting for that that's how each
generation gets better and if you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: get a better generation you better go back
and you fix something because there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: point moving on when you have an f3
generation that just is dismal compared to
[SPEAKER_02]: f2 you better go back in the f2 generation
either across different brothers and
[SPEAKER_02]: sisters to get a better result or realize
that f2 is where you need to stop with
[SPEAKER_02]: this and you may actually have created a
seed strain that that generation when sold
[SPEAKER_02]: to the customer is producing an amazing
plant however if he tries to play across
[SPEAKER_02]: his mother females and males he's going to
get shit and need to buy back seeds people
[SPEAKER_02]: in many other communities not the cannabis
community as much or maybe not as vocally
[SPEAKER_02]: have used that strategy you know for all
of history basically sellers of seeds of
[SPEAKER_02]: all different types of flowers and so on
and vegetables and prized tomatoes or what
[SPEAKER_02]: have you they want you to not be able to
just make more of their seeds that they
[SPEAKER_02]: sold you they want you they want to come
back and they want you to come back to
[SPEAKER_02]: repeat business and that sort of thing so
that may have been a part of somebody's
[SPEAKER_02]: goal in a breeding program right so yeah
so that might have been like wow this is
[SPEAKER_02]: great look at the result we're getting the
f2 generation is like this is an amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: plant but when you press the brothers and
sisters the f3 generation just falls apart
[SPEAKER_02]: perfect let's keep making f2s and selling
those seeds yeah and and you're good yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: it's almost some monsanto level stuff yeah
so yeah it's smacks of monsanto but you
[SPEAKER_02]: know i'm just talking about every
possibility what could be possible whether
[SPEAKER_02]: you know sounds of morally just or various
or what you know so i mean if we were to
[SPEAKER_03]: think about the epigenetics of seeds you
mentioned earlier that the soil we have
[SPEAKER_03]: now is much better than the soil we have
before how do you find the seeds of
[SPEAKER_03]: cinderella for example are coming out now
versus before do you see they're about the
[SPEAKER_03]: same germination ratio or do you think
that as our you know input ingredients
[SPEAKER_03]: have improved so has the seed output
quality no i don't think so i mean they
[SPEAKER_02]: because of a better nutritional program
that they're on now you think is that what
[SPEAKER_03]: your question is that they may have we've
got better so a better understanding of
[SPEAKER_03]: how soil works true we build it more
complete nowadays i don't know it's
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult to say we had great germination
rate back in the 90s with what i was doing
[SPEAKER_02]: then and you know i think when a seed is
formed it's formed it's you know it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be healthy it's it may be larger
you know if it it had more energy devoted
[SPEAKER_02]: to it while it was growing many times we
see that like when you just pollinate a
[SPEAKER_02]: few of the sort of pre flowers on a veg
plant and they end up growing a seed it's
[SPEAKER_02]: oftentimes a big one isn't it yeah so when
the plant has a lot of energy to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to devote to it the seed gets larger so i
would say if i start just to notice like
[SPEAKER_02]: the seeds now that i'm making are bigger
and darker and healthier than the ones i
[SPEAKER_02]: remember from back in the day then i would
say yeah that's right i don't think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: to a degree that's a you know noticeable
though i haven't said to myself wow it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not like the old days these are really
much bigger and darker i mean i think i
[SPEAKER_03]: had healthy seeds then you know yeah so
would you consider doing a limited release
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of similar to how the original apollo
13 was done and if you did would you do it
[SPEAKER_03]: in a similar way because there is a small
trend in the breeding community for people
[SPEAKER_03]: to do very limited release batches and
consequently that the cost per pack is
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes astronomical sometimes quite
justifiable how would you feel about doing
[SPEAKER_02]: it if you were to do it well i think just
doing something in a limited quality
[SPEAKER_02]: limited quantity so that you would have
fewer of them to sell and drive demand and
[SPEAKER_02]: price up and that's not how i like to do
things if it were released in a small
[SPEAKER_02]: quantity it's just because we only had
this small quantity we don't intend to do
[SPEAKER_02]: anything more with this was that it was a
side project and i would tend to charge a
[SPEAKER_02]: low price for it or give it away as a
freebie when people bought our other
[SPEAKER_02]: strains and i guess that was the case with
the apollo 13 kind of back in that time i
[SPEAKER_02]: was giving them to richard at heaven
stairway and he was sort of making those
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing decisions as to should i sell
these or you know and how many of them he
[SPEAKER_02]: had and he decided to sell them but it was
only the one batch and i didn't have more
[SPEAKER_02]: so he sold out of whatever 500 seeds and
maybe 50 packs and and that was that and
[SPEAKER_02]: so we recreated it this year but i didn't
want to again you know do it forever but
[SPEAKER_02]: we made a lot more than the first time so
that there's plenty available for everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: so they can really see what that was but
apollo 11 was really the goal and we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: make that as a reliably you know appearing
appearing on our menu all the time kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: strain great but apollo 13 for the moment
i think we made quite a good lot of it and
[SPEAKER_02]: when it's gone we won't immediately
replace it let's say yes still semi semi
[SPEAKER_03]: unique um so people sometimes talk about
returning to our land race roots and we've
[SPEAKER_03]: already mentioned that uh brothers groom
is working with the derby would you ever
[SPEAKER_03]: consider crossing it to another land race
or heirloom so to speak and really trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to work out those raw genetics in you know
like a somewhat unseen way before see
[SPEAKER_02]: that's um always on the table i mean when
you feel like hey i've been um thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: about a project and it doesn't necessarily
have to come from what we already have on
[SPEAKER_02]: our palette you know i could be out on a
trip somewhere and make a point of going
[SPEAKER_02]: to some place where i think i'm going to
go out and do like a land race seed
[SPEAKER_02]: expedition and come back with some cool
stuff and who knows in our future you know
[SPEAKER_02]: i'm an adventurous type of person i'd like
to probably do that one of these times so
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah what would be wrong with that i would
only hesitate to do that if it was just
[SPEAKER_02]: like you know to slap two things together
we don't do that you know we always have
[SPEAKER_02]: some purpose like a forethought of why are
we crossing these two what's the what's
[SPEAKER_02]: the goal and uh make maybe at some point i
guess go somewhere and i find something
[SPEAKER_02]: unique and interesting that i think like
oh this would be a great project to cross
[SPEAKER_02]: this with whatever else and then i'd do it
but you know it'd have to be thought out a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit so you know just just from the
way your brain works it kind of i get the
[SPEAKER_03]: feel that you're always intended to be a
breeder was it the discovery of those
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds that really planted the seed in your
mind to do the breeding was it like these
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds are so amazing i've got to breed
them or were you always kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: peripherally thinking about the idea due
to your dealings with sssc i think it was
[SPEAKER_02]: more a sense of uh preservation of the
genetics for myself and not be not losing
[SPEAKER_02]: them i kind of wanted to say like what if
ever you know i shut down and i want to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to start up i'd like to have seeds
that could replace the the clones i've
[SPEAKER_02]: been drawing growing you know or whatever
that was one emotion i had and i just feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like growing the plants and is one part of
it but seeing that progression of when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're crossing them and breeding them is
fascinating and to try to get handles on
[SPEAKER_02]: that and you know learn how to control it
like anything you know i became an
[SPEAKER_02]: engineer i think because i was always
curious about how does that work i don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to walk through the world and not
know why it takes five seconds for the
[SPEAKER_02]: ball to fall from the hundred foot bridge
or whatever you know i'd like to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to work that out so when i see all this
coming together like building blocks and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know it gives me great joy and
satisfaction to feel like i have some
[SPEAKER_02]: control over that remember when i first
got sparked my interest to be a grower in
[SPEAKER_02]: the first place was learning that you mean
the photo period and the 12 hours or the
[SPEAKER_02]: 18 i can uh stall time or force them into
flowering learning that was so you know
[SPEAKER_02]: inspiring that that really launched me my
motivation from that point so were there
[SPEAKER_03]: ever any strains you smoked while you were
in between the first and the current
[SPEAKER_03]: incarnation of brothers grim where you
were smoking them and you just kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: thought wow like if i ever come back i
want to work with that or maybe now i'm
[SPEAKER_03]: also thinking back you thought of a
certain strain you had during the hiatus
[SPEAKER_02]: and thought yeah we need to work with that
yeah you know i always come back to the
[SPEAKER_02]: Durban tie and say like you know that was
something that i would love to try to get
[SPEAKER_02]: get ourselves back into and we're we're
working on that and i think we will have a
[SPEAKER_02]: good one very soon so and then like i say
you know there's a sense that during the
[SPEAKER_02]: time i had those seeds and the access to
everything i never tried as much of it as
[SPEAKER_02]: i would have liked to have done and and
learned you know like what i was missing
[SPEAKER_02]: batrix and uh williams wonder those kinds
of things that huh i wonder what they were
[SPEAKER_02]: like you know if i went over the menu and
i looked at you know item by item which
[SPEAKER_02]: ones i grew and what that was like but
remember earlier when we almost started
[SPEAKER_02]: the thing out you know uh there was that
question about you know do you realize
[SPEAKER_02]: you're making history when you're making
history you don't you know and at the time
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not really thinking like well one
day this won't be here i won't have it to
[SPEAKER_02]: try that other can you know over there of
seeds and i just always thought you know
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah i'm messing around with this one and
that one and that one i'll get around to
[SPEAKER_02]: those ones someday and then that someday
never came and the rug was kind of pulled
[SPEAKER_02]: out from under me and i got married to a
woman who wanted me to give up marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: shell yeah so let's talk about lab
percentages and more specifically if you
[SPEAKER_03]: guys started getting numbers that were
like you trusted them and they said like
[SPEAKER_03]: legitimately 15 but you were really happy
with the high and you swear it was killer
[SPEAKER_03]: would you be happy to tell people those
numbers like are you of the belief that
[SPEAKER_03]: the numbers are really kind of not a true
picture of what you're getting or do you
[SPEAKER_03]: think that they are important in the
current climate i think the reliability of
[SPEAKER_02]: the labs is in question i know that
there's a motivation whenever you're in a
[SPEAKER_02]: business like that and one of the biggest
examples i could give you a standard in
[SPEAKER_02]: pores and moodies when they were
evaluating stocks during the the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: housing bubble they were competing with
each other for their customers business
[SPEAKER_02]: and so consequently there they had to rate
the stocks higher than they would have
[SPEAKER_02]: normally done if they didn't know that
their competitor would have rated them
[SPEAKER_02]: high just to get the customers business
there's certainly that going on right now
[SPEAKER_02]: there are labs who are just bumping
numbers more and more just to say geez you
[SPEAKER_02]: know where'd you get your test you know
and the guys talk to one another and then
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody goes scrambling for that lab
because they give the big numbers come on
[SPEAKER_02]: i mean i don't know i don't believe the
numbers it's there's there's no i don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think there's enough standardization and
enough reliability to those numbers that
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody can really say much about it yeah
maybe there are people who can do but i
[SPEAKER_02]: don't think that those people are the ones
that most people are listening to or
[SPEAKER_02]: working with but if some group of
scientists say that okay we've done all of
[SPEAKER_02]: the necessary testing and such to prove
that this is true then it's believable you
[SPEAKER_02]: know but i don't think that everybody's
using the right equipment or interpreting
[SPEAKER_02]: it properly but if like i say you know the
right equipment and the right people who
[SPEAKER_02]: know how to use it are saying that we've
calibrated all of this this is the true
[SPEAKER_02]: number we'll stand on this you know for
all time going forward if you'll you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: never find that we did this wrong we got
it right great you know but i don't see in
[SPEAKER_02]: the forms that people hand out you know
like oh here's the piece of paper that
[SPEAKER_02]: said you know the results come on a child
could have created a software program that
[SPEAKER_02]: would kick those numbers out make it look
just the same as that piece of paper right
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't prove anything yeah so i would
like to see a lot more you know proof of
[SPEAKER_02]: is that number believable is that
something that's a standard that
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody's using and everything else i
don't i don't think we're there for that
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah so and then there's the greed and the
motivation to yeah have a higher number
[SPEAKER_03]: than the next lab so what do you think is
the future of growing if we were say to
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of break it down into components of
say lighting technology growing mediums
[SPEAKER_03]: and nutrients genetics what do you think
will be the next big leap we make it's
[SPEAKER_03]: probably pretty easy to say that the most
recent leap has been in the lighting with
[SPEAKER_03]: the advent of the double-ended bulbs have
you seen any kind of new prototype
[SPEAKER_02]: technology which has caught your eye nope
the lighting is the main thing really you
[SPEAKER_02]: know because everything else is basically
h vac and soil and what do we have drying
[SPEAKER_02]: racks i don't know i i zone out and i miss
some things i don't know what are we
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about ah yeah the technology of in
the soil for sure yeah i think so
[SPEAKER_03]: technology so to speak has improved a lot
then again so is mine yeah now there's so
[SPEAKER_02]: many there there's a lot of little subtle
things and you know i tend to just sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: make broad sweeps with my brush sometimes
um not always too great effect but anyway
[SPEAKER_03]: um okay today what yeah stopping yeah no i
was gonna say um we we see a lot of news
[SPEAKER_03]: about the new skunk lines coming out do
you guys have any plans to re-release any
[SPEAKER_03]: other old staples and do you want to give
us any more info on when we can expect to
[SPEAKER_03]: see these skunk varieties of more
available when you say old staples not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily our old staples yeah going
back to yeah well it's all about uh back
[SPEAKER_02]: to the future a little bit with us i guess
you know we we we'd like to go back to the
[SPEAKER_02]: roots and bring people the old original
strains reliable consistent plants uh you
[SPEAKER_02]: know that our seeds aren't all over the
place and they are what we claim them to
[SPEAKER_02]: be and the descriptions are accurate and
such um but going back to any particular
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses it's not necessarily always in
mind as to which ones they might be uh but
[SPEAKER_02]: i guess i go by feeling still in life uh
quite a bit and those those things aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: something where i can say like oh over the
next two years there's a plan to do this
[SPEAKER_02]: that and the other thing but three to six
months out we usually know what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing and it's kind of like uh we'll get
some information the project suggests
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves to us you know as we go along
yeah so when you go back to when you were
[SPEAKER_03]: first doing the initial back cross project
to even now who were some of the breeders
[SPEAKER_03]: who you looked up to slash do you still
look up 20 breeders or is it more so now
[SPEAKER_02]: just a science process i mean i don't
necessarily know if i even knew who they
[SPEAKER_02]: were i mean neville was a name that was
bandied about back then as a breeder who
[SPEAKER_02]: you know was in the news and in the
magazine high times and such and so i did
[SPEAKER_02]: know of him and um then you know there's
uh dj short and breeder steve and the kai
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know the mates that i knew off of
the internet that we were all kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: colleagues at the time doing similar
things and like i say no competition
[SPEAKER_02]: really it's just uh everybody doing their
own thing and kind of being friendly about
[SPEAKER_02]: it and um that was my little community but
i didn't ever know any of the big you know
[SPEAKER_02]: like a name like neville somebody who's
not on the same continent as me and i
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't cross paths with and the
communication and information was not as
[SPEAKER_03]: good then clearly so well if you found out
that uh case was actually neville probably
[SPEAKER_03]: and he you know and he wanted to work with
you on something is that something you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to do or you think it's just divorce
i mean i'm uh i like you know i'm friendly
[SPEAKER_02]: purse and i've always been open-minded and
i'll talk to anybody about anything and i
[SPEAKER_02]: have respect for i have respect for him so
why would i turn down a conversation you
[SPEAKER_03]: know i'm trying to make this dtc 99 happen
yeah well if he's got the other half and
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah there was something he said he does
have seeds yeah yeah i'm sure so he's
[SPEAKER_03]: waiting he probably knows what he's going
to do with them so how do you feel about
[SPEAKER_03]: the colorado cannabis scene how do you end
you know in specifically do you think
[SPEAKER_03]: colorado has it the best or do you think
maybe some other states have figured it
[SPEAKER_02]: out a little bit better than them i don't
have a lot of experience in the other
[SPEAKER_02]: states and in colorado the cannabis scene
is almost you know read dab scene you know
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's not a cannabis scene so much as
a dab scene and a glass scene and a
[SPEAKER_02]: pecking order of uh folks who are sort of
trying to find their place here and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know there's a lot of very heady uh no pun
intended uh you know a very heady
[SPEAKER_02]: atmosphere them for them to at a young age
come and have an exposure to so much
[SPEAKER_02]: freedom and an ability to be in a
community like this where they may have
[SPEAKER_02]: had a dream of what it was going to be
like before they got here and found that
[SPEAKER_02]: the reality wasn't quite what they thought
it was going to be in many turn around and
[SPEAKER_02]: have to come go back where they came from
so you see all of that sort of thing and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you know you also have at the other
end of the spectrum folks who have made a
[SPEAKER_02]: business of inviting all of these folks
who do very well in the business out to
[SPEAKER_02]: big parties and they have after parties
and you know the it's rubbing elbows with
[SPEAKER_02]: you know all of the mucky muck of glass
blowing artists and who knows what else
[SPEAKER_02]: you know so it's a that's what i've
experienced and i don't have another state
[SPEAKER_02]: to compare it to but it's a vastly
different terrain and growing up you know
[SPEAKER_02]: consuming cannabis as a teenager and a
young adult throughout the other parts of
[SPEAKER_02]: my life the dabbing in glass alone is a
game changer it's just like this uh oh my
[SPEAKER_02]: you know isn't that a whole different way
of doing that enjoying this cannabis which
[SPEAKER_02]: um you know i'm a little bit neutral on i
like it sometimes but i don't make it you
[SPEAKER_03]: know my main thing at all yeah so we're at
the end of it and we just got some little
[SPEAKER_03]: short answer questions to blast through
quickly yes and no yeah i'll give you two
[SPEAKER_03]: questions you can answer with yes i'm
sorry you don't have to give me yes or no
[SPEAKER_03]: questions um so true and false what's your
favorite strain right now i am um pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: partial to the uh genius haze uh that's a
you know really nice uh up new strain that
[SPEAKER_02]: we have and um apollo 11 i mean you know i
have to pick a favorite right you know so
[SPEAKER_02]: you know it's we're playing around the
princess haze too we haven't released it
[SPEAKER_02]: yet because we don't have large enough
quantities so yeah you know that's tough
[SPEAKER_03]: sophie's choice you know and what's one of
your favorite strains from the past that's
[SPEAKER_03]: now lost you know oh loss huh well it
wasn't anything known to anybody else but
[SPEAKER_02]: i i grew you know across from when i was
working with sssc that i just thought was
[SPEAKER_02]: and kesh thought as well when i shared it
with them i told them what i had done and
[SPEAKER_02]: i'd taken that durban tie and crossed it
to a skunk number one and got these early
[SPEAKER_02]: maturing purple uh budded uh outdoor
plants that were absolutely killer in both
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor and aroma and great potency i sold
some to a guy uh thanks i sold some to a
[SPEAKER_02]: guy who worked in a restaurant and i only
had the bit that i sold him and he came
[SPEAKER_02]: back to me asked me for more i said i
don't have the same one i have something
[SPEAKER_02]: else even though the second one was a very
good weed he came back to me complaining
[SPEAKER_02]: later like you know uh well that first one
was killer you know that second one what
[SPEAKER_02]: the fuck was that you know i'm like uh i'm
sorry dude you know it's perfectly
[SPEAKER_02]: respectable weed it's just that that first
one was like this mind-blowing shit that i
[SPEAKER_02]: grew outdoors and uh i lost the seeds from
that so i i guess that would have been one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the biggest i wish i had those seeds
today that that was quite amazing um if
[SPEAKER_03]: you could go to one place geographically
and one place in time to get seeds where
[SPEAKER_02]: would you go wow what a great question huh
man back in time i guess um you know it
[SPEAKER_02]: would be uh thrilling i guess is that go
back and be in vietnam with the uh during
[SPEAKER_02]: the war and uh thailand or cambodia or one
of those places and uh and get you know
[SPEAKER_02]: have some adventure that i don't get
killed right but i have a bunch of really
[SPEAKER_02]: exciting moments where you know yeah the
whole uh you know raiders of the lost tomb
[SPEAKER_02]: for a weekend or something where i get
laid three times and you know find a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: pile of cash and come back with sacks of
original seeds from these amazing plants
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah i'll take that thank you um so what's
the worst strain in your opinion or you
[SPEAKER_03]: know maybe a more politically sensitive
way would be what's the strain that you
[SPEAKER_02]: just didn't agree with personally the most
didn't agree with me when i spoke
[SPEAKER_02]: something and it just didn't agree with me
let me see about that you know it's uh i
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to try and slag anybody's weed
or anything but uh i can't even say you
[SPEAKER_02]: know it would be embarrassing to someone
and it's just stuff that's been sent to me
[SPEAKER_02]: and i grew it out and said hmm all right
at least then it kind of lets me know what
[SPEAKER_02]: that person thinks is good you know but
and then it kind of confirms why when i
[SPEAKER_02]: send people samples of my buds they rave
and like oh my god and i'm like really you
[SPEAKER_02]: think it's that good seriously you know so
but yeah i wouldn't put single out any one
[SPEAKER_02]: strain or any any one person who has sent
me something that didn't work out but you
[SPEAKER_02]: know those that would be the basket i
would turn to just to answer that question
[SPEAKER_02]: and say uh this is something that was a
disappointment okay so did you want a
[SPEAKER_02]: disappointment or something that just
turned me off altogether and i hate it i
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to smoke that pot yeah i know
you want that exciting uh thrilling the
[SPEAKER_02]: theatrical answer there the dramatic
answer i kind of do have a common
[SPEAKER_02]: denominator feeling about smoking
marijuana that you know it's all getting
[SPEAKER_02]: high on marijuana there are a lot of
subtle differences between the strains and
[SPEAKER_02]: all this type of thing but there's a
common denominator there where it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: did you get high on pot yep i'm high on
pot you know and they all do that to you
[SPEAKER_02]: to some degree and with some flavors of
one thing or another either psychoactivity
[SPEAKER_02]: or actual taste buds palates but it's all
pot you know maybe i i can simplify
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes a little too much but it's all
pot you know you smoke some hash it's
[SPEAKER_02]: different than smoking flowers you smoke
some dab it's different than the other
[SPEAKER_02]: thing but there's you still know you have
a marijuana hog i don't sure you know yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: so so final question to disappoint yes
that's my point so yeah final question
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah are you gonna do any more photo
exhibitions and when ah yeah probably not
[SPEAKER_02]: in any time soon if the the bug strikes me
and i start to work a little bit more at
[SPEAKER_02]: it but i've been lazy in photography ever
since leaving new york and you know i do a
[SPEAKER_02]: bit here and there just for my own
pleasure and to keep up with the things i
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know yeah i'd like to think so i'd
like to think that i could take stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: i did in the style of photography that i
developed for myself and adapt it to what
[SPEAKER_02]: we do here and i've done that a few times
in different ways if i had work enough
[SPEAKER_02]: body of work to put together to say like
you know here's some interesting spins on
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis photography then i had maybe a
dozen pieces to show or something i might
[SPEAKER_02]: you know but it's way down the list of
priorities there's so much to do all the
[SPEAKER_03]: time now awesome so i think that just
about wraps it up yeah thanks i'd love to
[SPEAKER_03]: thank yourself for coming on the show and
giving us some awesome stories and a
[SPEAKER_03]: wealth of knowledge is there any comments
or shout outs you wanted to make before we
[SPEAKER_02]: wrap it up shout out to the growstones
folks and the dragonfly folks greenhouse
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse hydro supply down in longmont
on main street they've been so good to us
[SPEAKER_02]: you know high times i guess i have to give
a shout out to danny danko he's been
[SPEAKER_02]: hanging in there with me and communicating
with me recently we're going to get some
[SPEAKER_02]: articles written about us in high times
