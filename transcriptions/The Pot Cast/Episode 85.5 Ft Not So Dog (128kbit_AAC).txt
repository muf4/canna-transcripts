[SPEAKER_02]: patreon guys www.patreon.com forward slash
the podcast we really appreciate it much
[SPEAKER_02]: love to the patreon gang huge shout out to
Not-So-Dog for giving us so much of his
[SPEAKER_02]: time we're very grateful here to talk all
things history breeding politics and so so
[SPEAKER_02]: much more so without further delay one
thing I found really interesting about
[SPEAKER_02]: what you just said there was you know you
said that the chem 4 you think it might
[SPEAKER_02]: have like some nl5 haze in it and you've
said that the D probably the 91 crossed to
[SPEAKER_02]: the super skunk so then my question
becomes what do you think the 91 is like
[SPEAKER_02]: you know we discussed in our first part
that it may or may not be the puck but I'd
[SPEAKER_02]: love to hear just even generally like
Afghani and L what sort of vibes do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think it'll be well it's a great mystery
but what I will say is that CSI and I have
[SPEAKER_00]: this theory that possibly the chem 91
itself is an s1 already because when we he
[SPEAKER_00]: when it when it got s1 those seeds are so
uniform right like there's there's you
[SPEAKER_00]: know there's some variance in potency and
there's a little bit of variance in
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors and stuff like that but the look
and the growth pattern and all that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like very narrow yeah right and so and
that's you know that's obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: observation it's weird in the sense that
I'll bring up his name again or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: but because he's just so prolific but he's
told me that basically there's almost
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing in his collection that passes on
potency as consistently as the chem 91
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah you know that it you know it doesn't
look that great and a lot of times it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's dark it's not that frosty you know it
has these weird leaves it likes to eat
[SPEAKER_00]: itself sometimes and you know like the
leaves yellow and look all funky and start
[SPEAKER_00]: dying on you and stuff but the actual weed
itself you know it really is potent it
[SPEAKER_00]: affects most humans pretty strongly right
and so I you know I don't actually believe
[SPEAKER_00]: it's related to the puck at all I've seen
I've grown the puck I've grown high bids
[SPEAKER_00]: of the puck I know there's a rumor that
it's like you know and some people
[SPEAKER_00]: strongly believe that it's from Oregon and
that like there was this dog bud that got
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed to the puck and that's what they
got again that would be the type of thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that the puck lives right and so does the
chem 91 and so if we ever get genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: testing that's that specific one would
hope they'd be able to tell mother and
[SPEAKER_00]: child but I don't see very many growth
similarities or buzz similarities in it
[SPEAKER_00]: you know at the at the first you you
actually visited us the the at one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: canna luminati parties that happened after
emerald cup at the the second year but
[SPEAKER_00]: that first the year before that that you
weren't at you know I had all these kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of theories about it and CSI was like what
if it's just an s1 what if it's just an nl
[SPEAKER_00]: leaning s1 of nl5 haze and I was like and
I didn't want to believe it but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the funny thing about it is there's
so little known you can almost insert your
[SPEAKER_00]: pet theory into it and you know because we
don't know the grower the as far back as
[SPEAKER_00]: we can trace the chem 91 are the middlemen
at best so there's nothing verifiable on
[SPEAKER_00]: what it was really we do know that it came
that it was weed in 1991 and so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: look at you know strains that were around
back then and you can try to think of this
[SPEAKER_00]: or that or whatever I wouldn't hazard to
guess but to me I've always kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: considered it as some kind of throwback
ancient afghan some kind of like weird
[SPEAKER_00]: kush you know just because it was you know
its its effect is so indica it is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: taller than a lot of afghans you know it
has some stretch to it which is unusual
[SPEAKER_00]: but I wouldn't hazard to guess because you
know I was just barely starting to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: weed back then and I don't think we you
know I think our best hope is for genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: to prove the relationships between these
things but that won't necessarily tell us
[SPEAKER_00]: where it came from that'll just tell us
what came after sure yeah I can agree and
[SPEAKER_02]: just to quickly clarify because you sort
of alluded to it but I'd love to just get
[SPEAKER_02]: it firmly because I remember I asked going
to be a the same thing do you think that
[SPEAKER_02]: the chem dog does have some amount of
sativa component in its lineage I could
[SPEAKER_00]: buy that yes I could yeah very interesting
it's tall you know in a sense um it's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of it's kind of lanky uh you know uh it's
it's certainly not some like squat afghan
[SPEAKER_00]: thing like the puck or like um like purple
urkel or you know something that like
[SPEAKER_00]: grows super slow and super tight inner
nodes has a certain amount of stretch to
[SPEAKER_00]: it um I take it 10 weeks so it goes you
know um 70 day I know there's debate on
[SPEAKER_00]: when to take it I take it upper 60s you
know 70 days that's when I find to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: potency to be the best for me you know
there's been people that have started
[SPEAKER_00]: taking it earlier because it tests higher
earlier in terms of like THC percentage um
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't care about THC percentage I
care about my preferences you know so um
[SPEAKER_00]: and it seems like when you take it 70 days
um it likes to fall in that like 18 to 22
[SPEAKER_00]: percent range but if you take it in at 55
days it tests at like 29 percent but I
[SPEAKER_02]: think it's worse wheat yeah interesting I
mean you're a good person to ask this one
[SPEAKER_02]: too what sort of genetics in general do
you think pair really well with the chem
[SPEAKER_02]: dog style genetics do you think like so
for example do you think sort of pairing
[SPEAKER_02]: it with other cushy similar sorts of
plants do you think really radically
[SPEAKER_02]: different crosses tend to do pretty well
from your experience what do you think are
[SPEAKER_00]: good pairs usually breeding in general
radically different is all is usually
[SPEAKER_00]: better than very similar as a general rule
um you know I've gone on record saying
[SPEAKER_00]: this a whole bunch uh I think uh chem
skunk is unbelievable hybrid you know um
[SPEAKER_00]: because chem brings you know skunk tends
to not be that potent really um chem
[SPEAKER_00]: brings the potency and the skunk brings
aromas and it brings frost and it brings
[SPEAKER_00]: you know some stretch and stuff like that
so uh I am a big proponent of crossing
[SPEAKER_00]: radically different things and seeing what
comes out uh I don't think that sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: when you cross things that are too similar
to one another you don't actually get that
[SPEAKER_00]: much interesting progeny you know and I
think that's kind of happened with cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: uh where they crossed way too many of the
similar things together for too long and
[SPEAKER_00]: they lost certain aspects of of quality in
there and then they can't find them again
[SPEAKER_00]: so I think the best thing for chem dog to
cross to is something that you think is
[SPEAKER_00]: like got really good growth traits and is
really terpy but maybe lacks potency and
[SPEAKER_00]: you want some added heft to the bud and
you want to add some potency um adding
[SPEAKER_00]: potency would be the number one reason I
would cross chem dog to something yeah you
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned skunk in there is a nice counter
part you've got a decent amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: experience with the super skunk and I'd
love to ask you you know how how would you
[SPEAKER_02]: describe the super skunk what was it like
was it like rks to you was it something
[SPEAKER_02]: different do you think it came from uh the
sssc skunk stock that skunk va talks about
[SPEAKER_02]: when he says that the story he was told
from his mentor is that it was like an f2
[SPEAKER_02]: of some skunk stock what do you think here
is genetic and and what was it like from
[SPEAKER_00]: your memory uh well the certainly the um
what what it's like from the memory I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: chat about and that it can just be my
personal thing um you know I've I've
[SPEAKER_00]: communicated a bit with uh I guess we'll
call him skunk va's mentor you know uh but
[SPEAKER_00]: he he's kind of like a uh older tour
rainbow hippie and like a lot of the guys
[SPEAKER_00]: that you interview uh or talk to that bred
in the 80s they didn't really keep very
[SPEAKER_00]: good notes and they kind of hodgepodged
things together um my understanding of it
[SPEAKER_00]: which does not negate what he said
whatever is that you know um dude had
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff from neville and stuff from ssc that
was skunk right which makes sense because
[SPEAKER_00]: in the 80s those are really the only two
major seed banks that existed and he
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed um he crossed these various
different things together okay over a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of years and he used to call it the
skunky skunk okay and then I believe in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1990 the super skunk as a strain came out
from neville and I think that he took his
[SPEAKER_00]: skunky skunk and crossed it to the super
skunk okay and I believe when some people
[SPEAKER_00]: call it the skunk six or whatever that was
the the number six pheno of that cross now
[SPEAKER_00]: could it have been he made that cross to
the super skunk and then made f2s and then
[SPEAKER_00]: it popped out of there too sure you know
um he's light on detail when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: that and I do believe that you know uh
skunk va you know he told a different
[SPEAKER_00]: story a long time ago and I don't think it
has anything to do with lying or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that I just think it's like different
pieces of information come to you at
[SPEAKER_00]: different times right um and on top of
that the guy that made it got into some
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble uh with some uh you know some
grateful dead types things and went on the
[SPEAKER_00]: run for a while so it wasn't like dude was
around okay um when it comes to my own
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences I'll just I'll say this um it
was lime green uh it was fast I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: it was done about eight weeks okay um if
you took it longer it had a tendency to
[SPEAKER_00]: herm uh the herms had live pollen right
and it sometimes would herm early so but
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes sense right because it takes
four or five we've made seeds it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: four or five weeks after pollination for a
full seed to form so if you pull down some
[SPEAKER_00]: chem dog or you pull down some super skunk
and there's tiger striped viable seed in
[SPEAKER_00]: there at 60 days that pollination had to
happen much earlier right so um the super
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk wasn't the end all be all that
everybody makes it out to be um it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: it was moderate potency right um it grew
fast it was very lime green it was very
[SPEAKER_00]: frosty it it was it was light and what I
mean by that is like you could put a
[SPEAKER_00]: really big bud on a scale and you would be
surprised at how little it weighed like it
[SPEAKER_00]: was it was I don't want to say dense it
was like well formed but not particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: dense right you know uh and you know it uh
it didn't smell like skunk at all in veg
[SPEAKER_00]: but as it grew I would say probably two
three weeks before you harvested so maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: like week six on it was a real problem how
bad it smelled I mean people talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: like that lost skunk terp I remember
pulling up in my driveway with my windows
[SPEAKER_00]: down and getting out of my car and being
like oh no it was kind of like in the era
[SPEAKER_00]: before carbon filters a lot of people
actually stopped growing it because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: a bust it was really really hard to
contain the aroma and humans typically
[SPEAKER_00]: have a really sensitive nose to that kind
of that kind of like funk that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk you know um and so I could not you
know people talk about carbon filter
[SPEAKER_00]: killers you know this was before carbon
filters but I could not contain the smell
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't it the last couple weeks of
harvest it was like before harvest it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like oh man you know uh I would pump it
into my attic I would put it through like
[SPEAKER_00]: um you know uv generators and then have
like a 30 foot run and tubing to let let
[SPEAKER_00]: the uv try to kill it I would blow it in
my garage I would do all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: things because it was kind of the era
before carbon filters became popular it
[SPEAKER_00]: still wreaked to high heaven it wreaked
like crazy um and what was interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: about that is I didn't know I didn't
nobody in my circle ever talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes or anything like that but today I
would say that the thing that made it
[SPEAKER_00]: skunky was pretty volatile in the sense
that the two weeks before harvest it
[SPEAKER_00]: wreaked during harvest it wreaked and for
that first three or four weeks after you
[SPEAKER_00]: cut it it really stank but the older it
got the more generic green weed it became
[SPEAKER_00]: right um and you know it was best fresh
like as soon as you could get it to burn
[SPEAKER_00]: that was when it was the best in fact
Staten Island and I we used to grow it you
[SPEAKER_00]: know um we used to grow rooms of it
together and we would like the the dog
[SPEAKER_00]: often because it was denser it often took
three or four weeks of like drying and
[SPEAKER_00]: curing before it got like its best self
yeah so we would often smoke super skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: incessantly for two or three weeks until
the chem dog kind of came into its own
[SPEAKER_00]: because we learned if we smoked the chem
dog too fresh it just wasn't as good of an
[SPEAKER_00]: experience as if we waited and if you
waited too long for the super skunk it got
[SPEAKER_00]: worse so if I used if I made hash from the
skunk it would actually keep in the jar it
[SPEAKER_00]: would keep the skunk aroma for a while but
I can remember smoking a bunch of like six
[SPEAKER_00]: seven eight week old super skunk and like
the flavor was mostly gone and out it
[SPEAKER_00]: would almost go to like generic green weed
so whatever the terpenes or whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: theols or whatever the components that
made that aroma they were somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: volatile and maybe they oxidized and they
were they only lasted for a period of time
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact when I was talking to you about um
uh you know what would I breed chem dog to
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole idea of breeding chem dog and
skunk together was to get the frost and
[SPEAKER_00]: the stretch and the lime green and the
flavor of the skunk onto something more
[SPEAKER_00]: potent because it wasn't that potent I bet
if you I bet if we had it today and you
[SPEAKER_00]: were testing it it would probably come out
in the mid teens and I don't think I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think it would be nearly as potent as like
death star tk or sour diesel or you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean to me sour diesel is chem skunk at
its at its core that to me was was the
[SPEAKER_00]: super skunk the super skunk was not a
perfect strain it hermed um it uh and then
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously sometimes too it's like when it
herms it's like back then it wasn't such a
[SPEAKER_00]: big deal but even still if you had little
white seeds or little immature anything in
[SPEAKER_00]: the weed people were going to complain um
a lot of people got rid of it because of
[SPEAKER_00]: how it smelled and a lot of people got rid
of it because they got tired of
[SPEAKER_00]: occasionally it herming out and throwing a
bunch of live pollen on their plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: creating immature to mature seeds like
obviously when you're trying to grow uh
[SPEAKER_00]: seedless getting seeds is a pain in the
ass and um it's one of those things about
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation where now for the last 10-15
years people have been falling all over
[SPEAKER_00]: each other to try to find that turp when
there was a lot of people that had that
[SPEAKER_00]: turp back in the day and chose to go in a
different direction with weed than that in
[SPEAKER_00]: fact when I got in trouble and I lost it
um I couldn't get anybody to help me back
[SPEAKER_00]: it up to be fair people wouldn't help me
back it up there you go there you go and
[SPEAKER_02]: look you mentioned the sour diesel being
skunk chem and something I certainly noted
[SPEAKER_02]: myself was that when I look at those early
polaroid skunk va took of the super skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: that structure undeniable looks like the
sour d but I've also heard you and many
[SPEAKER_02]: other people talk about how sour d
supposedly comes from the diesel too so
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to hear how does that all play
together do you think it's like just skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: onto chem or do you think how do you think
that plays into diesel too well again um
[SPEAKER_00]: is one of those things that genetic
testing is the only real way to solve the
[SPEAKER_00]: debate but if I had to make an educated
guess not being there I would say that uh
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll call him weasel I would say that the
weed that weasel had um was from Greg and
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg was growing according to his
conversations with Staten Island he was
[SPEAKER_00]: growing hybrids of skunk chem that he
loved and that skunk tended to throw herms
[SPEAKER_00]: into its progeny right and according to
you know uh swell and vondo they were
[SPEAKER_00]: buying sacks of this weed and they were
collecting you know they found some seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 or 15 seeds over the course of x amount
of of purchases over time right and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what they popped that became diesel one
and diesel two right and then apparently
[SPEAKER_00]: it hermed and they found seeds in diesel
two that lead to sour so I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: sit here and claim you know uh that I know
all the steps and again it was young
[SPEAKER_00]: partiers and there was some different
things going on and it's a multi-stage
[SPEAKER_00]: accident none of it was intentional right
um but you know when I look at sour diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: or the diesel family I can see both
parents I can see skunk and I can see chem
[SPEAKER_00]: in it does that mean it's the only thing
in it I can't say that for sure but you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I've grown um I've grown you know uh
ham now for I don't know 20 plus years
[SPEAKER_00]: right easily and uh I grew the skunk for
quite some time um the sour the original
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel cutting I have even does the
same weird leaf rust eating itself thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that chem 91 does and then sometimes you
crack a jar of sour diesel and just reeks
[SPEAKER_00]: like skunk you know and you see that like
you said you see that structure there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: undeniable similarity right like if you've
seen sour diesel spears and you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those old polaroids from skunk va
it's not a big stretch to say that man
[SPEAKER_00]: that spear really kind of looks like a
diesel spear yeah so I'm not saying I know
[SPEAKER_00]: the complete recipe to sour diesel but I
would say that the basis of it or a large
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of its genetics are chem skunk
I would bet money I would bet money yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly certainly and then so I guess
the next question is what do you think the
[SPEAKER_02]: differences are between some of the more
popular sour diesel cuts you know so you
[SPEAKER_02]: hear about sour diesel you hear about east
coast sour diesel the charcoals cut all
[SPEAKER_02]: these other ones do you think they're most
likely just s1s of each other or do you
[SPEAKER_02]: think some of them are just like hybrids
but very much leaning and then as a final
[SPEAKER_02]: follow up do you think the very original
sour diesel is still with us or what we
[SPEAKER_02]: have circulating nowadays is all sort of
offspring okay well I'll take that in
[SPEAKER_00]: chunks I would say that this I can say for
a fact is that when sour diesel sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel was probably the most popular
strain in America for at least 10 years
[SPEAKER_00]: okay in Mendocino County and Humboldt out
here like there's a lot of strains now
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's sort of like the demand
might be high but it's also shallow right
[SPEAKER_00]: where in the sense with sour diesel in its
heyday if you had good sour diesel it was
[SPEAKER_00]: basically endless the amount that you
could move and nobody cared about lineage
[SPEAKER_00]: the I've had I got a sour diesel cut on
2000 and it came helpfully labeled sour D
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about its history
before that but what I can say is that in
[SPEAKER_00]: that era it basically if it had the nose
and it had the look like you know it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like a broker would come by and they would
open up the contractor bag of turkey bags
[SPEAKER_00]: and they would stick their nose in it and
they would look up and they would be like
[SPEAKER_00]: this is gonna work like they still look at
it but like it's like if the nose hit them
[SPEAKER_00]: that strongly it's like they knew it was
going to work so in the first wave of sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel nobody cared about names it was
like there was one sour diesel cut and it
[SPEAKER_00]: like if your broker liked it that was the
cut forums came into play like much like
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the dog gets called the skunk VA
cut because he was the first person on the
[SPEAKER_00]: forum sort of hyping it up in a way right
and like forums add names to things right
[SPEAKER_00]: like the choco cut was the cut of sour
diesel that came from choco the Amish cut
[SPEAKER_00]: was the cut of sour diesel that came from
from shroomy the res cut you see what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: saying so it's like it's almost like a tie
to like well you know who spread it out or
[SPEAKER_00]: who'd you get it from and what happened is
is that no one really cared back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day what the lineage was then sour diesel
sort of got supplanted a bit by cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: and skittles and all that and now it's
sort of had another wave in the sun in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last three or four years and everyone's
gotten incredibly interested in the oldest
[SPEAKER_00]: realist best diesel cut out there but the
problem is is there's now like 15 or 20
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts that have sour diesel attached to
them I did in 2017 or something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: I did this sour experiment where I was
like all right I'm gonna see I think my
[SPEAKER_00]: headband is a renamed sour or something
like that maybe I got my sour diesel I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna gather up all these hours and I'm
gonna grow them side by side indoor and in
[SPEAKER_00]: my greenhouses and I'm gonna figure out
which ones mine are and which ones are
[SPEAKER_00]: which ones are just the same but different
names so I gather up eight or nine of them
[SPEAKER_00]: and I grow them all side by side and
they're all fucking different and none of
[SPEAKER_00]: them are mine and I'm like well man you
know and so there's East Coast sour diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: there's New York City diesel there's choco
there's Amish there's res cut there's you
[SPEAKER_00]: know there you can go through the list and
now the the last four or five years
[SPEAKER_00]: there's been Albany you know Manny this
that whatever else and from what I
[SPEAKER_00]: understand from what Vondo and swell and
Manny and these other guys say I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think there was just one cut even in the
beginning right like there was diesel one
[SPEAKER_00]: and two and then you know he found sour
diesel in a bag of diesel too but there
[SPEAKER_00]: was a few seeds right and then Vondo took
according to Vondo he took some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: same seeds and when he moved west he
popped some of them in LA res dog did this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing which annoys the crap out of me
which is you take a famous cut and you
[SPEAKER_00]: make seeds with it and you name your seed
line the cut so when res dog is selling
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel seeds how many of those seeds
do you think got named sour diesel every
[SPEAKER_00]: one of them right and then when you've got
a strain that's that popular that
[SPEAKER_00]: literally it's the most popular strain
going for probably a decade how many bag
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds on a strain that sometimes herms get
found and named and so now it's like in
[SPEAKER_00]: the last three or four years we've been
trying to like piece together what's what
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's like a big family with obviously
like a lot of different cuts involved and
[SPEAKER_00]: people have been putting on their like
Sherlock Holmes hat and trying to sort it
[SPEAKER_00]: all out and the deeper you go the more
confusing it gets so far at least and part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the problem like one of the good things
about like the chem dog story is that Greg
[SPEAKER_00]: gave the chem dog to Staten Island he took
it west he ended up giving it to skunk VA
[SPEAKER_00]: and he gave it to and you know I see
collective got it and then I got it right
[SPEAKER_00]: and so there's like really good provenance
of this person to this person to this
[SPEAKER_00]: person and it ties back all the way to the
beginning we don't really have that with
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel very well so so it's a big
family with at least a dozen to 15 cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: that all have the deep the sour diesel
moniker and 25 years later we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure it out and everyone's convinced
that they have the oldest realist bestest
[SPEAKER_02]: the right one the real one ain't that the
truth and you actually must be a bit of a
[SPEAKER_02]: psychic on the download because you
predicted how I was strategically lining
[SPEAKER_02]: these questions up to ultimately get us to
this one which is I want to talk about res
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about splitting the art
from the artist you know I think he's a
[SPEAKER_02]: great little piece to analyze for that
because I think undeniably he has to be
[SPEAKER_02]: the person who's the most polarizing yet
equally has you know some work that is
[SPEAKER_02]: really regarded by many to be quite
standout and even more impressively is
[SPEAKER_02]: that evidence has come out you know about
how he was just breeding in a few tents
[SPEAKER_02]: and like you know like it all seems very
unimpressive which makes you think like
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe there was some legitimate skill
involved there what's your thoughts on the
[SPEAKER_02]: res situation in terms of separating the
art from the artist do you have any soft
[SPEAKER_00]: spots for his work well you kind of have
to separate the art from the artist
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'll tell you that in researching
we have this like running joke amongst my
[SPEAKER_00]: small group of friends when we start
battling about like the 80s or 90s or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that which is like which
untrustworthy asshole do you put in your
[SPEAKER_00]: corner that you're gonna go to bat for
because they all have warts right and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know you look at I could pick apart Sam
skunk man you could throw darts at Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: Shanti you know you can you I mean there's
you know Jim Ortega you know all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different things and I'm not throwing it
out there to like knock any of those
[SPEAKER_00]: people I'm just saying that like humans
are complicated right and just because you
[SPEAKER_00]: do something cool in weed doesn't mean
you're not an asshole you could be a narc
[SPEAKER_00]: you could be a wife beater you could be a
drug addict you could be in general like
[SPEAKER_00]: not the greatest person and still produce
cool beans that make an impact right and
[SPEAKER_00]: so res is an interesting case in the sense
that even like my friends and I talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about this when we talked about the legal
scene but there's a big debate in the
[SPEAKER_00]: community about what's narking what's
ratting doxing what what ethics are
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable right and there's a lot of
people that do things that I consider to
[SPEAKER_00]: be ratting these days that are perfectly
that suffer no consequences right res is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the person in the community as
far as like publicly being shamed he's
[SPEAKER_00]: like the think of another person that got
publicly shamed for ratting he's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: only person that did it there's a list you
know yeah just to your last question like
[SPEAKER_00]: who else has been shamed that much it's
like no one really no one you know um you
[SPEAKER_00]: know so should should he be excluded uh
you know do I think he deserves like some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of extra special you know you're a
scumbag no but I I think there should be
[SPEAKER_00]: more people in the room with him because
because to me like when it comes down to
[SPEAKER_00]: it if you want to do something illegal and
you get caught you shut your mouth right
[SPEAKER_00]: and you just be quiet and you you accept
that what you did had some risk to it and
[SPEAKER_00]: you go down and not everyone does that
right and there can be all kinds of nuance
[SPEAKER_00]: to it and you can say oh they already knew
so much about all these different people I
[SPEAKER_00]: was just filling in some blanks you don't
know what it been like to go away for that
[SPEAKER_00]: long or whatever but when it comes down to
it it's like you're throwing someone else
[SPEAKER_00]: under the bus to get a better situation
for yourself and people can have whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: views they want on that I don't approve
and I generally speaking don't engage with
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are willing to do that some of
that is just self-preservation because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like well if they did it once why would
ever why would I ever talk to them about
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I mean imagine like you hook up
with someone right and and you find out
[SPEAKER_00]: that like she murdered her last husband
you might be like man gotta reevaluate
[SPEAKER_00]: this hope that was a extenuating
circumstances you know but it would be red
[SPEAKER_00]: and and so separating the artists from
from the art you really have to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that you could pick apart on IG he
had to turn comments off on his posts
[SPEAKER_00]: because it would just devolve into a open
warfare in the in that comment section
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath his IG posts and you know
there's there's defenders of him out there
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I don't know him personally but
you know it does seem like the one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: better ways to become a good breeder is to
have excellent starting stock so rez
[SPEAKER_00]: working with sour diesel and Chem D and
chems in general you know I love those
[SPEAKER_00]: strains so the likelihood that he's gonna
make something decent out of them is
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty high you know I mean I'd even say
that about Neville like half of a good
[SPEAKER_00]: half of Neville's success was he got to be
the first person to cross Hayes to
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Lights he got to be the first guy
to cross Northern Lights to skunk he got
[SPEAKER_00]: to collect the best of a lot of these
American breeders who didn't know each
[SPEAKER_00]: other and then blend those things that's a
really big component like I I mean I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll I'm a Neville backer and you know and
so I think he definitely had the eye and
[SPEAKER_00]: he was really good at seeing quality and
knowing what to go for but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: undoubtable that like he got skunk one he
got Hayes he got g-13 he got Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Lights he got these different things and
he got to blend them first yeah that
[SPEAKER_00]: matters because he started with really
good genetics and so I think rez dog has
[SPEAKER_00]: really good genetics and that helps and
you know I I can understand why I mean he
[SPEAKER_00]: it's funny in the sense that I know people
that know him and he's not even sure what
[SPEAKER_00]: the rez dog cut of sour diesel is or who
named it that or where it came from and
[SPEAKER_01]: he's got his name on it he's not even sure
how that occurred you know yeah that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a very interesting perspective and
I think for me the sort of the thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: to me gave me I sort of thought was like
the beautiful end outcome of it all was
[SPEAKER_02]: that when I spoke to gypsy who did do jail
time because of rez he had actually he
[SPEAKER_02]: says that he made his peace with it he
said I don't I don't hold the guy
[SPEAKER_02]: accountable he said you know like he
basically says I blame the laws in America
[SPEAKER_02]: the insane penalties that were being
imposed on people he said why why would
[SPEAKER_02]: you throw your life away it makes sense to
me that you would do that but regardless I
[SPEAKER_02]: understand your point of view but I
thought that's that's beautiful at least
[SPEAKER_02]: he doesn't hold him still to this day
accountable you know I could I could I
[SPEAKER_00]: could say something about that I won't get
too specific but let's just say that like
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously like when you're involved with
hippies on dead tour you know there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of ways that weren't exactly legal
that they we people did in order to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: traveling around the country without a job
you know and sometimes people got in
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble and sometimes people went to
prison over the things that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and it was really interesting there
was time times that there was people that
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought were total scumbags okay bad
people and they got busted and they kept
[SPEAKER_00]: their mouth shut and they went away for a
long time and there was people that I
[SPEAKER_00]: loved and I thought were good people and I
personally cared for a bunch and when they
[SPEAKER_00]: got in trouble they did whatever they had
to do to get out of that trouble and so I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's one of those things to speak to
gypsies point very very difficult to say
[SPEAKER_00]: what you would do if you're facing
significant prison time right like without
[SPEAKER_00]: actually facing it everyone of course
would like to say I would never but then
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like you know you can talk to us
and you can give us this and this and this
[SPEAKER_00]: and we already know so much about these
different people and you're not even all
[SPEAKER_00]: that important we actually want these
other folks and we already know so much
[SPEAKER_00]: about them if you can just fill in a few
little blanks here and there we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: massively reduce you'll spend a year not
ten right and they're scumbags about it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sense that they'll be like if you have
kids if you have a lady if you have this
[SPEAKER_00]: or that or whatever they're gonna use
whatever strings they can pull on to get
[SPEAKER_00]: what they want from you which is
information and not everyone is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: hold up in that environment there's not
you know and so you can judge people but
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said there was people that I was
like man if that person ever got in
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble everybody would be doomed and they
kept their mouth shut so it's really hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell until you're faced with it
yourself that's my experience at least you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it's very difficult and uh you know
that doesn't that's not me making excuses
[SPEAKER_00]: because I do feel strongly like I just
personally I don't you know like if I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think other people should suffer for
actions you are taking so it's like if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to go to jail or you don't want
to go to prison for something then don't
[SPEAKER_00]: do it yeah I mean there's there's a thing
I'll tell you honestly like I'm from the
[SPEAKER_00]: mid I'm from Chicago originally when I
moved out to California there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: money to be made if I wanted to ship a
bunch of California weed back to Chicago
[SPEAKER_00]: and I wouldn't do it because I was like I
would rather just grow weed in California
[SPEAKER_00]: and have it stay in California right I
don't want to be involved in some
[SPEAKER_00]: smuggling thing where I get in trouble and
then I have to go back and do a prison
[SPEAKER_00]: sentence or whatever in Illinois and then
beyond probation if somebody else wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: take that risk that's fine it's that's not
what I'm I don't want to do that right and
[SPEAKER_00]: so sometimes people take risk because
they're trying to make a lot of money or
[SPEAKER_00]: they're trying to do this or that or
whatever and it ends up you know if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to smuggle which is kind of like
when they brought down gypsy and all that
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of stuff if you're going
to break international borders and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do all that kind of stuff they're
probably going to come down on you pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: hard certainly I mean historically at that
time right it um the the penalties would
[SPEAKER_00]: not lax at all they were not lax at all so
I don't it's not like I you know it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a thing where I can still judge
you and forgive you hmm interesting does
[SPEAKER_02]: that make sense yeah no I get it it's
always interesting to hear the range of
[SPEAKER_02]: opinions because as we said at the start
it's such an interesting case analysis but
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier on before we started talking about
res and we were talking about chem and
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk you mentioned the clear chain of
provenance in the way the cutting had
[SPEAKER_02]: moved about and I wanted to quickly ask
you the provenance of the tk because
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously you know tk origins marty has
come out and you know I haven't had a
[SPEAKER_02]: chance to speak to him yet so I'm not
really sure what the sitch is but I'd love
[SPEAKER_02]: to hear do you think that's sort of the
story you're going on as to where the tk
[SPEAKER_02]: came from and you know as a loose
follow-up do you think that the tk is sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of the quote mother of all ogs no and no
and the the reason why the reason why I
[SPEAKER_00]: say that is that see this this is the hard
part too with like telling history and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that is that you get people's
feathers ruffled but really simple I
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't there so again it makes it hard for
me to make definitive statements but what
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say is that tk origins has told
three different stories about the origins
[SPEAKER_00]: of tk and he's written them all out you
know he told a certain version on icmag
[SPEAKER_00]: and then he told a certain version to us
on like our server and now he's got a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain version that he tells on instagram
right and they don't match up and like he
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote all the words so what do you do in a
situation where the person's story from
[SPEAKER_00]: him typed out by him does not match up are
we talking about like big or small
[SPEAKER_00]: discrepancies I guess pretty big so just
in a nutshell I mean I could I could after
[SPEAKER_00]: the show I could send you because I have
them saved I could send you the things but
[SPEAKER_00]: on the when he first wrote about it on
icmag he he talked about um he was he was
[SPEAKER_00]: young and he got hired by the guys that he
was working for um in 1994 to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam and mule back seats and they he
went they bought five or six different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains he listed them all out you know I
can't remember off the top of my head but
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like hawaiian indica and ak-47 and
and uh nl5 haze a few different ones on
[SPEAKER_00]: there they they came back they had this
cut called emerald triangle that the only
[SPEAKER_00]: thing they knew about it was it came from
the emerald triangle they were growing
[SPEAKER_00]: that they had this 12 light room that was
very difficult to move around in once you
[SPEAKER_00]: had it all set up he was being paid to be
the house sitter water boy run run the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow for these older cats they put in five
or six of these new strains they grew a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of the emerald triangle and at the
end of that they found some seats that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the first version so that's 1994 right
then he came out when he talked to us on
[SPEAKER_00]: the server he told us that he went there
in 1991 and he bought hindu kush directly
[SPEAKER_00]: from neville okay um and then now on
instagram he talks about how he went in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1989 and he and the guys that he was with
bought hindu kush directly from neville
[SPEAKER_00]: right the problem that i have with that is
that neville didn't sell hindu kush in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1989 you can go look at his catalogs in 89
and 90 there's no hindu kush in there the
[SPEAKER_00]: other thing he told me is that he turned
18 in 1990 which means that if his bosses
[SPEAKER_00]: hired him in 1989 to go mule seeds they
were hiring a 17 year old kid to do so i
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow doubt that they hired a minor
right to smuggle seeds for them so if i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to believe any of his so it's
basically like his first story was 1994
[SPEAKER_00]: his second story was 1991 his current and
most modern story is 1989 he went from we
[SPEAKER_00]: bought five or six different seeds i don't
know what hermed or what or what through
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen but it ended up seeding the emerald
triangle to i know specifically it was
[SPEAKER_00]: hindu kush even though hindu kush isn't
even listed on the six strains on his
[SPEAKER_00]: first story right so how do how do you
parse that is it 1994 is it 1991 is it
[SPEAKER_00]: 1989 is it the first five or six strains
that he listed when he first wrote the
[SPEAKER_00]: story is it hindu kush how did he get
hindu kush from neville in 1989 when
[SPEAKER_00]: neville didn't sell anything in his
catalog in 89 or 90 that was labeled hindu
[SPEAKER_00]: kush and he'll say i was there you weren't
there bye but he wrote out all those
[SPEAKER_00]: stories and hosted them himself so if i'm
going to believe anything i would believe
[SPEAKER_00]: the first story he told which is that he
was 22 years old or something you know 23
[SPEAKER_00]: he got hired by these guys to run a room
they brought him out to amsterdam to mule
[SPEAKER_00]: some seeds he got they got five or six
strains they grew them all up it was
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly a room of emerald triangle they
don't know what hit the emerald triangle
[SPEAKER_00]: they ended up lightly seeding the weed but
it was still valuable and it got sold and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where the that's where this that's
where it got found that i think is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the most believable if it's true
now if you want to extrapolate from that
[SPEAKER_00]: he estimates that there was 25 or 30
pounds of lightly seeded weed that they
[SPEAKER_00]: sold i don't think that the tk and the cut
that um matt bubba and josh d brought to
[SPEAKER_00]: la are the exact same one i have a
tendency to believe that there was a few
[SPEAKER_00]: phenos that got found in this lightly
seeded weed that ended up in florida i
[SPEAKER_00]: think i how many i can't say at least two
maybe three or four okay and out of those
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four strains comes the um this is
a joke but the 34 different phenos of og
[SPEAKER_00]: kush that we have today right you know um
i think it's one of those things that like
[SPEAKER_00]: you know as people get famous they need to
come up with more detail than they had you
[SPEAKER_00]: know um and like some people might say i'm
calling him a liar or something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: i just don't know how you take three
different stories that he all typed out
[SPEAKER_00]: and posted that are from three different
years and have fairly different details
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's like okay so if he's telling the
truth which version do you believe was he
[SPEAKER_00]: lying on the first story is he lying on
the second story is he lying on the
[SPEAKER_00]: current story is it a mishmash how do you
know it'd be one thing if it was all
[SPEAKER_02]: consistent what if what if he had turned
just to play deva's advocate before we
[SPEAKER_02]: move on what if he made a mistake and he
didn't turn 18 in 91 but he turned 18 in
[SPEAKER_02]: 89 that that could theoretically reconcile
the difference between story two and three
[SPEAKER_02]: but not one and then the others i guess
not not the first story that he posted
[SPEAKER_00]: that as the real tri tip or whatever on ic
mag where he says 1994 and not the list of
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that he gave that doesn't include
hindu kush sure the other problem is that
[SPEAKER_00]: he says he got it from neville and i mean
i can you can i'm sure you have them but
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't like there is nothing in
neville's catalogue in 1989 or 1990 that
[SPEAKER_02]: says hindu kush i guess you know that
that's really interesting to hear that
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective and that's good because i'd
heard there were discrepancies but i never
[SPEAKER_02]: knew what they were specifically but my
follow-up question is do you think that it
[SPEAKER_02]: was in fact hindu kush to whatever this
emerald mountain strain is or do you think
[SPEAKER_02]: the lineage might be something because i
think somewhere someone said oh emerald
[SPEAKER_02]: triangle that was a sort of hindu kushy
type plant i mean he said he said that
[SPEAKER_00]: they called it kush because of the you
know they you know the emerald triangle so
[SPEAKER_00]: it might not have been a kush at all you
know emerald triangle could you know but i
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know i wasn't there that i can't all
i know is that he wrote multiple stories
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't seem to add up we know that
from we know that the tk came from florida
[SPEAKER_00]: we know that the cut that josh d and matt
bubba brought out from florida to la in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1996 or whatever came from florida we have
pictures of that weed yeah uh and
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously like sour diesel kush became
extremely valuable and extremely sought
[SPEAKER_00]: after and it went from one or two or three
cuts to several dozen yeah true and people
[SPEAKER_00]: had an intention to you know muddy the
waters a little bit right um and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of times like i'm not throwing it
out there or whatever but i mean i think
[SPEAKER_00]: that for a while people thought in
california swamp boy seeds you know uh
[SPEAKER_00]: ricky and chrome and those guys were the
guys that like they were the tk guys like
[SPEAKER_00]: they were the people that sprouted it they
were responsible for it yeah i've heard
[SPEAKER_00]: that and then it kind of came out that
they just got it early certainly look it
[SPEAKER_02]: sounds like it's one of those ones where
we'll have to wait and see and as you've
[SPEAKER_02]: said a few times to a few questions you
know i'm sure at one point genetic testing
[SPEAKER_00]: will help yield some answers but you're
you're also asking a bunch of questions
[SPEAKER_00]: about uh a bunch of weed strains that
originate in the early to mid 90s at a
[SPEAKER_00]: time when prohibition was high and
information and the internet didn't exist
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of this information is
percolated out very slowly yeah long after
[SPEAKER_00]: the the initial events occurred yeah i
mean that that fucking uh that dude from
[SPEAKER_00]: hawaii i don't even like saying his name
but that dude from hawaii will tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: that it all originates from creepy that
that you know that the that the surfer has
[SPEAKER_00]: brought it out and it's actually hawaiian
originated from neville but hawaiian and
[SPEAKER_00]: then it went to florida and then the guy
alec i mean it's one of those things where
[SPEAKER_00]: you start pulling on it and it's like
there's unknowns and how do you resolve
[SPEAKER_02]: those unknowns true well look let's you
know we've been going for basically three
[SPEAKER_02]: hours now let's do some more fleshed out
light and fun ones before we wrap up and
[SPEAKER_02]: i've written some special ones that sure i
think i think we'll still be able to have
[SPEAKER_02]: a good little chat about them but there's
some interesting ones and so the first one
[SPEAKER_02]: i want to throw by you is did you ever get
to try the francine strain from statin
[SPEAKER_02]: island that skunk va spoke about or was
that gone by the time you met him it was
[SPEAKER_00]: gone i didn't try it but that that is the
reason why statin got um got the skunk at
[SPEAKER_00]: least um and uh statin got rid of it
because it had horrific mold okay it had
[SPEAKER_00]: really really bad mold problems um and you
know obviously like i don't know if you
[SPEAKER_00]: ever had this happen to you but if you've
ever had a crop you harvest a crop and you
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that it's riddled with mold it's
very depressing um and so he dropped it in
[SPEAKER_00]: favor of uh other strains he did have a
very nice glass piece by um by bob that he
[SPEAKER_00]: uh uh only had smoked the francine out of
and he never ever smoked any weed again
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it so it was just kind of like this
like museum piece or whatever um but
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately it you know there was a huge
fire in the 17 fires his house burned down
[SPEAKER_00]: and uh he lost all that glass then but um
yeah i was you know i don't i don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: i don't really like to tell this part of
it so i won't but i will just say that
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk va and statin island were best
friends um they had a falling out and then
[SPEAKER_00]: i ended up sort of being for that next
that next period sort of like statin's
[SPEAKER_00]: best friend um so uh skunk va and him were
friends before i knew him um and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: when he grew the francine by the time that
i met him he had replaced it with the
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk and the cam and it wasn't he wasn't
growing it anymore so i never saw it or
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked it yeah nice interesting okay and
then similarly would you have any interest
[SPEAKER_02]: in growing out either say the purest
indica because i know that that you know
[SPEAKER_02]: that seems pretty interesting or on the
other hand once tom's finished any of
[SPEAKER_02]: tom's haze either of those strike you as
interesting uh tom's haze certainly yeah i
[SPEAKER_00]: haze is uh i i love haze very much it's uh
it's very difficult to find a good one uh
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the part of the problem with haze
is that it takes forever and that only
[SPEAKER_00]: about um five or ten percent of them are
really super nice so you have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through a lot of mids and a lot of garbage
to find the exceptional ones but i would
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely lean much more towards that
because i do think the provenance of him
[SPEAKER_00]: getting it i believe him that he went
there in 1994 from positronics and got it
[SPEAKER_00]: i believe that he's like repro'd open
pollinated at a few different times um i
[SPEAKER_00]: went to i went to his i went to his house
not that long ago and uh saw the little
[SPEAKER_00]: project he had going on so i would be i
would be definitely interested in in that
[SPEAKER_00]: the purest indica i don't know how i feel
about that one really um for a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons but uh i i think um in general i
think that we have if you want to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about kems and kushes and the i think we
have a lot of really really exceptional
[SPEAKER_00]: afghanis to choose from and i think we
have less sativas to choose from than
[SPEAKER_00]: afghanis so if i had to choose which one
at this point in my life i'm more
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in it would be sativas simply
because we already have such a big
[SPEAKER_00]: blessing of indicas that are available and
out there yeah true that's a really nice
[SPEAKER_02]: answer i like that so we've been talking
about you know nl5 haze and neville i now
[SPEAKER_02]: want to ask you if you could ask neville
any two questions what two questions would
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to ask neville oh man huh that is
a good one um i've been blessed in that i
[SPEAKER_00]: get to talk to some of neville's old
friends still that helped him with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of projects so in recent years i've been
able to get a lot more in depth with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the questions that i had as best as
could be answered um i met neville several
[SPEAKER_00]: times in in holland but i was young and
and starstruck and i i would love to say
[SPEAKER_00]: that i had some like deep penetrating
conversation with him uh but i did not you
[SPEAKER_00]: know i did not have any kind of deep or or
involved combo with him in the few times
[SPEAKER_00]: that i was in the same room with him um
he's significantly older than me you know
[SPEAKER_00]: and i was a dumb kid um but i uh if i had
to ask him i would probably ask him and i
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of know this already but i would kind
of ask him um what of the things that he
[SPEAKER_00]: lost did he still think were most current
like were the things that he regretted the
[SPEAKER_00]: most and you know and why you know because
you know for instance if you read a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of his posts out of all the seeds he got
from sam skunk man um he only got about
[SPEAKER_00]: seven or eight of those hazes to pop and
by 1991 he only had one left because they
[SPEAKER_00]: were long flowering and a huge pain in the
ass and he didn't realize there was
[SPEAKER_00]: anything special about them until he'd
made a few mistakes so he never actually
[SPEAKER_00]: got like almost i think all of the
commercially available seed stock was all
[SPEAKER_00]: from haze c you know but there um there
was one year that he released haze b but
[SPEAKER_00]: he never really got a chance once he knew
what he had to play around with them so i
[SPEAKER_00]: guess my second question would be if you
had all seven hazes that you popped what
[SPEAKER_00]: directions which ones would you cross and
why and where would you want to go with
[SPEAKER_02]: them brilliant i love that pondering
thoughts for us all i definitely would be
[SPEAKER_02]: interested to hear what his answers are
and now i want to remix it same question
[SPEAKER_02]: you get to ask two questions to sam the
skunk man what are you gonna ask sam would
[SPEAKER_00]: he would would he be would he have to be
honest with me he has to be honest with
[SPEAKER_00]: you uh what afghan did he use in skunk one
and when he was making skunk one is the
[SPEAKER_00]: mexican columbian part of it polyana from
rob clark uh-huh that's beautiful thoughts
[SPEAKER_00]: there that's what i would ask him if he
had to be honest do you believe that the
[SPEAKER_02]: columbian that was used in skunk is the
same one that was used in haze as the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet stories say you know i don't know
um part of the problem with the haze story
[SPEAKER_00]: is that until it gets to europe there's
only really one guy telling it you know
[SPEAKER_00]: supposedly there's a haze brother or two
that's alive but they've never decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: come out there and talk publicly so you
only have sam and i can tell you from the
[SPEAKER_00]: forum days he has been defending
everything he says is the absolute truth
[SPEAKER_00]: for 25 plus years vigorously uh on
cannabis world he used to go by the handle
[SPEAKER_00]: know it all for sure and he would fight
people like intensely on all this
[SPEAKER_00]: different stuff and you know um there's a
big debate whether like you know there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no doubt his impact on things but like the
other part of it is that the one other guy
[SPEAKER_00]: that was around a bunch was rob clark and
their best friends and he won't refute
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that rob says or that that sam
says so it's really hard to get um you
[SPEAKER_00]: know like if you do if you do a study and
you get a result you hope somebody else
[SPEAKER_00]: can get the same result yeah it would be
it would be and that's kind of like the
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific method or whatever is like can
different people do the same experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: and get similar results i would love if
there was five or six different people
[SPEAKER_00]: they were all talking about the skunk and
the haze in that era and were willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: put what they remember down on paper
because what we basically have is sam's
[SPEAKER_00]: version and so how do you battle that uh i
know that that rob was working with a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of mexicans and columbians me and a
few friends have a sneaking suspicion that
[SPEAKER_00]: the that the um the the uh sativa side of
skunk one is from rob's work yeah but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to say i mean all tell you do you
remember how you know matt and i did those
[SPEAKER_02]: interviews with mad jag don't go there i
was this my next question no go for it
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah of course they're incredible well i
will say that like when he got all those
[SPEAKER_00]: skunks in 1978 it was rob who delivered
them all to him too true and that was you
[SPEAKER_02]: you're such a mind reader because i was
about to say you know having done those
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible episodes with mad jag how has
your perspective changed on rob clark i
[SPEAKER_00]: have always had a high opinion of rob
clark one of the first three books i
[SPEAKER_00]: bought to teach myself how to how to
anything about weed was marijuana botany
[SPEAKER_00]: um it's a little bit simple these days but
for some for in an era where there was
[SPEAKER_00]: almost no verifiable information about how
the cannabis plant worked to have rob come
[SPEAKER_00]: out with a very simple primer laying out
how to breed and how it worked and what it
[SPEAKER_00]: did um he was invaluable to me in teaching
a lot of basics about cannabis you know uh
[SPEAKER_00]: and it seems like you know he did a lot of
work it's he's kind of quiet about it i
[SPEAKER_00]: think if i had to guess i would say he
lets sam shine with some of his work and
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't care about it that much in terms
of like who gets the credit but that would
[SPEAKER_00]: be for him to say um i do think it's
interesting like speaking of mad jag or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever that sam always insists that his
seed company was him and only him and
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody else was involved but him but then
when mad jag bought like a ridiculous
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of seeds in 1978 it was rob who
flew them out and gave them all to him you
[SPEAKER_02]: know do you not think that it's
interesting because what i took away from
[SPEAKER_02]: that moment when i heard that was these
guys must have felt like they were still
[SPEAKER_02]: small fry for rob to have delivered that
order in person for what was what was like
[SPEAKER_00]: three or five grand or something it was
five grand in 1978 it was the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase of seeds that they had ever done
at that point right and but but it's still
[SPEAKER_02]: still small fry in the scheme of things
right so i think i thought to myself they
[SPEAKER_02]: must have been really giddy like wow
there's a big sale for us considering
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd hand delivered it yeah and and mad
jag still has the original packaging they
[SPEAKER_00]: came in he does so that's pretty crazy and
he's got you know real experience and like
[SPEAKER_00]: what they were like back then and all that
and you know he said rob had a just
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible collection of killer weed um
when he when he when he got hand delivered
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds or whatever um you know i i
think this is indisputable although sam
[SPEAKER_00]: won't like it but i think when sam went to
holland he gathered up a bunch of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: from people he knew and brought them out
there haze skunk he got the durban poison
[SPEAKER_00]: and the afghani one from mel frank you
know um so it wasn't all just his work i
[SPEAKER_00]: think some of it was rob's work some of it
was mel frank's work some of it was his
[SPEAKER_00]: work some of it was the haze people's work
because even he admits that it's like you
[SPEAKER_00]: know um he didn't do the haze it was like
he got seeds of it you know and uh you
[SPEAKER_00]: know but there's inconsistencies in his
story too he'll swear that he was never
[SPEAKER_00]: busted and then i've watched videos of mel
frank saying oh well he went to holland
[SPEAKER_00]: after his second bust you know so some of
these things are like old timers covering
[SPEAKER_00]: for each other you know but you got to
realize the era that they were into uh and
[SPEAKER_00]: most of it i will say for anybody that is
listening to me um my experience with seed
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding is whoever gets famous there's a
small group of friends or associates
[SPEAKER_00]: around them that helped at various stages
that don't get the credit so i do not
[SPEAKER_00]: believe that sam was like alone with no
helpers with no partners with no buddies
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing that he was doing it all
himself that every strain he used was
[SPEAKER_00]: original to him and no one else ever had
it can i prove it wrong no but you know i
[SPEAKER_00]: uh um i also think that from what neville
said and from what corel from sssc and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these other guys said is that the
skunk that he brought over at first was
[SPEAKER_00]: much different than after he had done some
open pollinations and his own line
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding in amsterdam and you know he bred
it in a way that they didn't prefer so but
[SPEAKER_00]: rob rob is one of the more important
people in cannabis in his era he wrote a
[SPEAKER_00]: he wrote some lasting books um he he got
some information out there i definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: think he did a lot of underground breeding
and i think he's responsible for more than
[SPEAKER_00]: he wants to admit so would i wish that he
would just come out and say it all sure
[SPEAKER_00]: but despite that he still did it and we
still benefit from it so huge kudos to rob
[SPEAKER_02]: the the next question i have for you is
that photo of neville in the hash den in
[SPEAKER_02]: afghanistan i think it's got to be the
most iconic cannabis photo of all time do
[SPEAKER_00]: you agree or disagree it's pretty iconic
um you know i think neville gets a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: credit in the sense because he was first
he certainly suffered more than most seed
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders being first and struggled a lot
more um you know he got bitter in the end
[SPEAKER_00]: because people you know stole so much
stuff from him but it's actually kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting in that regard of i don't know
if he's told this story so it's not like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's secret and he and he wrote it on mr
nice but do you know what he had to do to
[SPEAKER_02]: prove he wasn't a de agent didn't you have
to like shoot heroin in front of him or
[SPEAKER_00]: something yeah because they figured no de
agent would do that and it just turns out
[SPEAKER_00]: that he was a heroin addict so he could do
that without dying but his photographer
[SPEAKER_00]: clied odied over there and almost died
jesus um so it was very sketchy i mean he
[SPEAKER_00]: went over there and dealt with the
muhajideen you know when the soviets were
[SPEAKER_00]: you know were right in the middle of their
big afghanistan war there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff going on over there you know and um
it is pretty interesting to think that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you like weren't a heroin addict you
probably would have either had to refuse
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe been killed by the muhajideen or
you would have done it and odied and died
[SPEAKER_00]: because you didn't have a tolerance
because you weren't a heroin addict huh
[SPEAKER_02]: right place right time it's funny how life
works sometimes interesting stuff i'm sure
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone's keen to hear more about that
and maybe at some point we'll hear more i
[SPEAKER_02]: have this opinion i've held it for a while
i think i might have even said it once or
[SPEAKER_02]: twice i think sub calls space queen male
the male he calls space dude i think that
[SPEAKER_02]: is maybe the best male we have access to
like it's still around it's it's empirical
[SPEAKER_02]: evidence it produces nice crosses i think
it may be the best male that we have what
[SPEAKER_02]: comes to mind when i say that and agree
slash disagree uh well i will say that uh
[SPEAKER_00]: with the reversals revolution males are
few and far between i'll also say that
[SPEAKER_00]: males um typically get traded much much
less than females so there really isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: like a collection of elites in terms of
males that get passed around right um so
[SPEAKER_00]: males are sort of like the the secret
sauce if you were and um you know i uh i
[SPEAKER_00]: would say and i i've been trying to find
figure out if it exists for forever to me
[SPEAKER_00]: the most impactful male in cannabis is
probably the haze sea male yeah and i hear
[SPEAKER_00]: rumors that it's alive and i hear rumors
that it's not you know but as far as like
[SPEAKER_00]: an impactful it doesn't mean we can get
our hands on it but as far as an impactful
[SPEAKER_00]: male that's like made a bunch of hybrids
that have gone on to be like crazy um you
[SPEAKER_00]: know uh just influential in the scene that
is probably the primo male that's existed
[SPEAKER_00]: um but i don't have any experience with
his space i mean that male really so i
[SPEAKER_00]: can't really comment on how good it is or
not but i will say that before all this
[SPEAKER_00]: reversal stuff existed um male matt likes
to call it the shotgun method but really
[SPEAKER_00]: there's there's no way to test to see if a
male actually does what you want unless
[SPEAKER_00]: you grow out its progeny which is very
time consuming obviously because you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to like make seeds and then grow them out
and then see and so when people find males
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the day it used to be that all
those seed companies the males were the
[SPEAKER_00]: backbone and the most important part of
their breeding process they were hoarded
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly because once you found a male
that passed along desirable traits that
[SPEAKER_00]: you were looking for it took so much time
and effort to figure that out that you
[SPEAKER_00]: typically held on to it never passed it
around which means no one else ever got to
[SPEAKER_00]: experience it i don't know if i answered
your question or not but that's about as
[SPEAKER_02]: close as i can come no that's good and
it's it's a very interesting point that
[SPEAKER_02]: you know with the advent of how popular
reversals are does it even is it even
[SPEAKER_02]: really that relevant anymore which is i
can certainly understand that so onto the
[SPEAKER_02]: second last question for our part two will
people ever be able to buy your seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: probably um i have uh it's kind of a
running joke in the crew right where i
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't commercially said yes yet because
you know i watch what all my friends go
[SPEAKER_00]: through when they sell seeds and it just
looks so attractive getting people calling
[SPEAKER_00]: you a hack or a chucker you know or a herm
breeder or a fake or this or that and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of like um you know it's really hard
to accuse you of being a money-grubbing
[SPEAKER_00]: scumbag when you're not making any money
off it you know so and then the other part
[SPEAKER_00]: of it too is that all the breeding that
i've ever done has been for me and to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to breed weed that i liked and to create
weed for my friends that we liked i never
[SPEAKER_00]: actually and by doing that it's incredibly
freeing because you literally don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to care what the public thinks so once
you're in a commercial seed situation you
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of have to try to make things that
you think people will like yeah if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to make money off it if you're fine
with just making what you like and if it
[SPEAKER_00]: bombs it bombs you know but in the way
seeds are now anytime if i made if i made
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and i passed them out there would be
a bunch of people that would there would
[SPEAKER_00]: be not a bunch but there would be some
people that would be like oh he's been
[SPEAKER_00]: building this um you know this group for a
while just to like have a market to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: his seeds oh we knew this was coming you
know or then people grow them out and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not what they want or they herm or
they this or that and it just goes to show
[SPEAKER_00]: that i'm like i'm a shitty breeder or
whatever uh so with all that being said i
[SPEAKER_00]: do think i'm going to release some seed um
probably before the end of this year and
[SPEAKER_00]: it is going to be stuff that interests me
and hopefully people like it and if they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't they don't i like that i like that
we'll wait and see what comes i'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll be very exciting it could also fail
too i mean it's actually like in it's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually in progress right now but we'll
see it's gonna i'm gonna try to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm gonna try to do some reversals you
know and if it works out uh you'll know
[SPEAKER_02]: about it and i don't want to reveal too
much i'll leave the finer details for you
[SPEAKER_02]: to really reveal in due time but i would
love to know what what are you reversing
[SPEAKER_00]: at least uh well i'll say this um there
are there are a number of projects that i
[SPEAKER_00]: have going and i kind of balance them
between my own interests and then things
[SPEAKER_00]: that i don't think are generally speaking
out there in the public right because even
[SPEAKER_00]: though i've held chem 91 forever there's a
lot of people doing reasonably you know
[SPEAKER_00]: doing some pretty good breeding work with
it there's no like shortage you know of of
[SPEAKER_00]: chem 91 beans out there right so if you're
going to make an impact or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that in this in the seed world you might
as well bring out things that are not very
[SPEAKER_00]: circulated so at least you're adding some
new wrinkle or some new genetics to the
[SPEAKER_00]: larger pool that's out there so that in a
sense um you know uh is a big driver
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you're gonna do it you might as
well try to like break some new ground or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever um so there's some things that
could be in the works in terms of like
[SPEAKER_00]: that uh that headband cut that i call the
la because i don't think it's very well
[SPEAKER_00]: circulated and it's one of my favorites um
that that definitely is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: something um my maui cut that i have um
also not particularly well circulated so
[SPEAKER_00]: and i have some really cool ideas with it
uh possibly the flow rider og cut that i
[SPEAKER_00]: have which is also not very well
circulated but it's in cookies um and so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a combination of something that's
rare that people could you know maybe take
[SPEAKER_00]: in a different direction but then also
something that to be fair commercially
[SPEAKER_00]: something that i think people would be um
interested in you know i had friends talk
[SPEAKER_00]: me out of you know it's not like i'm gonna
do like some bode thing and right off the
[SPEAKER_00]: bat and like release like extreme sativas
that are a huge pain in the ass and uh you
[SPEAKER_00]: know would take forever and would you know
you're trying to you're trying to like
[SPEAKER_00]: balance what would people be interested in
what would be something new what would be
[SPEAKER_00]: a different wrinkle you know and to me
it's it's um it would be a cool way to get
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic out there that uh aren't that
spread with the la it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: cheating in the sense that i gave it to
csi and he released la by tk and la by
[SPEAKER_00]: chem d which got like very warmly received
and a lot of people found winners in that
[SPEAKER_00]: and so it sparked some interest so it
leads me to believe that perhaps um that
[SPEAKER_00]: could be both fun for me and commercially
viable you know so uh and then i'll say
[SPEAKER_00]: this and this might get me into some
trouble or whatever but uh it turns out
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's a lot more chem d's out there
than people think and um that opens up
[SPEAKER_00]: some room maybe for i might do some chem d
work not only because i love it and i
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's super potent but also because i
think there's four or five cuts out there
[SPEAKER_00]: um at least that go by the moniker of chem
d and even some ones that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely sure is is the one might not be
the one that i have doesn't mean mine's
[SPEAKER_00]: special or whatever i'm just saying that
like it kind of fits into that like get
[SPEAKER_00]: something a little different out there um
and then you know those things if those
[SPEAKER_00]: things actually work they would probably
get crossed to a bunch of things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: i hold in my collection that i think would
be interesting you know some sativas some
[SPEAKER_00]: afghans some purples some this some that
some different things it probably would be
[SPEAKER_00]: very old school grouping of cuts because
that's kind of where my collection leans i
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have a whole bunch of new zaza so
you're not going to see a list of uh of
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are wildly popular in the last
four or five years it would probably be
[SPEAKER_00]: blends of classics you know i mean my
whole breeding career i basically just
[SPEAKER_00]: like made seeds for me and friends and
given them away so the whole idea of like
[SPEAKER_00]: starting a seed company is a little odd um
but uh you know i have so many good
[SPEAKER_00]: friends bugged me about it um that uh it
might be time so we'll see here here
[SPEAKER_02]: that's exciting stuff so on to the final
question for this interview it's sort of a
[SPEAKER_02]: two-parter but i'd love to hear it you're
going to theoretically start a company
[SPEAKER_02]: from scratch you've lost everything you've
got you're starting fresh you can pick one
[SPEAKER_02]: pack of seeds to presumably find a male
from that and then start the company with
[SPEAKER_02]: that here's the two-parter to it one
possible outcome is you're going to do it
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's what's available today has to be
something that's currently commercially
[SPEAKER_02]: available and then the part b is you could
sort of do the time machine thing where
[SPEAKER_02]: you could pick a pack from throughout time
you know and choose a so what would your
[SPEAKER_00]: two options be in each scenario well um
boy so if we're talking about one pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from today you've got to realize
that because you said i would you'd get a
[SPEAKER_00]: male to start it that eliminates probably
95 of the current market because we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been doing reversals now for a good 15
years so the amount of people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing regular seeds is very small well
let's let's jazz it up you could you can
[SPEAKER_02]: equally you can get a pack of csi you know
chem d cross headband and get a female and
[SPEAKER_02]: reverse it that's also cool you just it
just has to be one pack one pack um well i
[SPEAKER_00]: would say if i can if i can pick all
females and reverse it i'm going to cheat
[SPEAKER_00]: and i'm going to say i would get a pack of
lad from csi simply because those are two
[SPEAKER_00]: of my all-time favorite strains that i
would have lost and i would like to hunt
[SPEAKER_00]: through those both to refine leaners that
of the things that i lost and i also think
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's just incredibly fireweed both of
them so the chances that you would have
[SPEAKER_00]: good things and then um if if we're
talking regular seed right um this might
[SPEAKER_00]: sound nuts but i would probably if i can
get some shit from i would probably try to
[SPEAKER_00]: get some of that uh op uh haze that uh tom
is working on if we're going actual like
[SPEAKER_00]: regular males and stuff like that you know
um because that that ties back to way way
[SPEAKER_00]: way back you know and there's a lot of
diversity in there and you could take that
[SPEAKER_00]: and you could cross it to a lot of modern
indicas and a lot of different new new new
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's so different that you could get
some cool stuff perhaps and then if i
[SPEAKER_00]: could go back in time boy if i could go
back in time i'll cheat a little bit and
[SPEAKER_00]: and say something that most people
probably won't think of um but i would
[SPEAKER_00]: probably go back and try to get early
pearl and the reason i say that is because
[SPEAKER_00]: one of neville's oldest friends that i
chat with told me that the last five six
[SPEAKER_00]: years of neville's life he was crossing a
bunch of mexicans together because out of
[SPEAKER_00]: all the stuff that he had one of the
things that he was really hunting to find
[SPEAKER_00]: he'd done a bunch of haze work in
australia with the the um the outback you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and all that type of stuff but he was
really looking for this certain sweetness
[SPEAKER_00]: and the certain buzz that he got from
those mexicans that came from the early
[SPEAKER_00]: pearl and so i figure um if he loved it
that much that out of everything he ran
[SPEAKER_00]: through as he aged he really wanted to
refine that uh maybe going back in time
[SPEAKER_00]: into the late 80s and getting some early
pearl when it was still legit before he
[SPEAKER_02]: got lost would be that would be something
cool that's beautiful really cool to hear
[SPEAKER_02]: i wouldn't have thought of that that's a
i'm gonna have to dig more into the early
[SPEAKER_02]: pearl obviously i tried a little sample of
pips uh silver pearl and it was beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: so i can only imagine the early pearl
equally special i think uh with that being
[SPEAKER_02]: said we're just about at the end of it for
this one did you have any general comments
[SPEAKER_00]: or shout outs you'd like to make um
comments sure i say this a lot but i'll
[SPEAKER_00]: say it again is uh grow we that you love
uh if you're breeding try to find two
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that you like qualities of each and
you hope maybe you can get those qualities
[SPEAKER_00]: in the progeny itself so therefore like
don't breed for what you think other
[SPEAKER_00]: people will like breed for what you think
you would personally like that's the best
[SPEAKER_00]: way to do breeding is to look for things
that you enjoy and when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation nobody can preserve
everything but if you can hold on to one
[SPEAKER_00]: or two or three things during this storm
that's going on right now if you can find
[SPEAKER_00]: some old things that really speak to you
and you really love um you can't hold
[SPEAKER_00]: everything but even holding on to one or
two or three old maybe even currently on
[SPEAKER_00]: popular things but really really do it for
you um that can help preserve it for
[SPEAKER_00]: better times ahead you know and then
beyond that thanks to all the weed nerds
[SPEAKER_00]: and everyone else that like listens to my
homie show all the time and i appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: uh there being enough interest for him
having me back and listening to me babble
[SPEAKER_00]: for hours on end so that's always good and
um you know uh we will uh if you know if i
[SPEAKER_00]: do decide to release seeds of the public
or whatever i'll certainly like pass it
[SPEAKER_00]: out through him and the various things and
you know a small core group of enthusiasts
[SPEAKER_00]: can keep something cool going so even
though you're out in the middle of nowhere
[SPEAKER_00]: or even though you feel isolated even
though it's something if enough of us work
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the same goal um we can kind of
keep the fire burning uh through some
[SPEAKER_02]: tough times and that's that a truly
beautiful and inspiring sentiment and i
[SPEAKER_02]: think i speak for us all when i say we're
very excited for the idea of an upcoming
[SPEAKER_02]: seed release we'll have to wait with bated
