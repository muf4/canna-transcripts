part two of the epic interview of Marty of
[SPEAKER_00]: TK origins Florida native Creator of TK OG
here to talk some history Some plans for
[SPEAKER_00]: the future So much more Let's get into it
Beautiful stuff and I wanted to ask you
[SPEAKER_00]: there's there's weirdly like a lot of
reports online and I've never really known
[SPEAKER_00]: much about it people used to say that the
white was very similar to the TK and Like
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes the name like the white used to
be called triangle or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do you know anything about that at
all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually When I did I was talking to
the swamp boys around she said 2017 well
[SPEAKER_01]: living down there in Central America and
we had some conversations for a while we
[SPEAKER_01]: had some mutual friends and once we
started talking we started talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: who we knew back in Florida together and I
was talking to Chrome and he told me the
[SPEAKER_01]: story of the white came to him as a plant
called the triangle and He was definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting in here interested in hearing
the story about the emerald triangle on
[SPEAKER_01]: any sort of relation And actually the
white I've only seen it one time but is
[SPEAKER_01]: that my friend Craig's house and that was
the closest Terps that I've come across
[SPEAKER_01]: since Back in the day with the animal
triangle, but I don't think it's the same
[SPEAKER_01]: plant because I took an ounce home and it
dried out I dried it out a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: and I kind of lost his turps and it a
little bit more bland tasting than I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember Definitely didn't have that sweet
floral thing going on the demo did but
[SPEAKER_01]: something about it when it came out of the
freezer had those exact like Memorable
[SPEAKER_01]: turps from back in the day and that was
the closest thing I've seen to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I told from that old story And you
know, I can't it's only speculations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know for sure, but it could
be related It could be a seed of the
[SPEAKER_01]: emerald triangle or something related to
it somehow Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've just never grown the white
personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only seen it in flower form Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually haven't tried the white myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to try some I definitely wanted
to say I tried a really nice pure loco So
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely that was a good one from our
archive I wanted to ask you, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: because in terms of The whole storyline in
in recent episodes we'd had not so dog and
[SPEAKER_00]: inspector on the show and they both
commented that they felt like they'd seen
[SPEAKER_00]: some discrepancies within the storyline
and Posts from maybe like I see mag over
[SPEAKER_00]: the years and on different sources They
sort of felt like there had just been
[SPEAKER_00]: inconsistencies between the dates and the
ages I guess the question is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, has there ever been different,
you know, has your memory changed over
[SPEAKER_00]: time?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, oh, you know, I think I was
different age or you know Where do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think this comes from this view?
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be from the second time I went
to Amsterdam Which I went to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cup there high times cannabis cup at first
I thought for some reason that I went
[SPEAKER_01]: there for that trip in 91 or 92 and I'm
pretty sure I might have mentioned out to
[SPEAKER_01]: a few people here and there but I come to
find out later on after talking with Adam
[SPEAKER_01]: done about a few things that it had to be
later because He we had shopped at this
[SPEAKER_01]: place called the greater coffee shop that
trip and we were we bought some good flour
[SPEAKER_01]: from there and they told us where we could
find some seeds and of the stuff we bought
[SPEAKER_01]: there like bubble gum and a K-47 and There
was this place called the CIA which Adam I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess owned or his partners with the time
and all it was like this little black door
[SPEAKER_01]: Up this like abandoned looking building
and had a word the three-letter word CIA
[SPEAKER_01]: on it So it was like sketchy even walking
in the door, but we were given Directions
[SPEAKER_01]: by this guy the gray house or the gray
area coffee shop To go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know I had shopped at the CIA and
maybe I met Adam He looked familiar to me
[SPEAKER_01]: after all that and seen him on the podcast
years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So The discrepancy might have been where I
thought it was not even 192 when I went on
[SPEAKER_01]: that trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was actually 1993 because we
Basically think there was a year he opened
[SPEAKER_01]: that place and I remember there was a huge
hemp plant grown in the middle Like you
[SPEAKER_01]: walk up these walk in the door and you've
got the straight staircase that would go
[SPEAKER_01]: up to Like a lounge and as much people
hanging out smoking and there was like a
[SPEAKER_01]: desk where they're selling seeds there I
think and it might be like a little DJ
[SPEAKER_01]: booth set up and in the middle of the room
or is like this huge pot with this giant
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp plant and Look like a bamboo trunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like huge nothing never seen
anything like it before it was like
[SPEAKER_01]: probably 15 foot tall growing for like a
Sunlight up to the top of the building So
[SPEAKER_01]: when I ran that story by Adam,
he told me they had to be 1993 because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's when he had that going on so,
you know thinking back to When I first
[SPEAKER_01]: came out Basically my story actually it
came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started going Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started going online while I was stuck
on house arrest and probation before I
[SPEAKER_01]: moved down to Central America and long
before I created origins and I started
[SPEAKER_01]: searching Triangle Kush and I found some
stories here and there from people talking
[SPEAKER_01]: shit about how it came to Florida from
some military guys like from overseas and
[SPEAKER_01]: brought seeds back other stories are
talking about I was named after the three
[SPEAKER_01]: cities in Florida I mean Jacksonville
Tampa and Miami, which I laughed at all
[SPEAKER_01]: those stories I might have chimed in a
couple times saying this is all bullshit
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever it was and I got people
telling me You know what you're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wasn't very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on there at all Whatever story I
told back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was I was draining at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't smoking I was pissed off at the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was pissed off the government I was
looking forward to getting off all that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff so I could move on and start growing
again and at that point like my wife and I
[SPEAKER_01]: were fiance and I had plans on moving down
to Latin America where I already built the
[SPEAKER_01]: house so I was just wanting to be done
with everything and if I was on any sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of IC mag or whatever that was back then
in those days and it was just to like try
[SPEAKER_01]: and correct people that were spreading
rumors that were false about Names and how
[SPEAKER_01]: I got named and where it came from and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was my that was my time on there
as far as also dog goes me and him had
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations when I first created origins
and those guys even invited me to their
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald Cup parties that I went to a
couple years in a row with Josh and it
[SPEAKER_01]: seemed to me like right after the pandemic
I went to the last Emerald Cup before the
[SPEAKER_01]: pandemic and for the elections and it came
back from that trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like wet and cold and gloomy and I
came back sick as can be probably had
[SPEAKER_01]: COVID who knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get back to Central America and
basically after that this guy stopped
[SPEAKER_01]: following me for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I blame it on something that might have I
might have done like on one of my posts
[SPEAKER_01]: that's kind of political I guess thinking
back to it and I'll never do it again but
[SPEAKER_01]: this is during the elections it was during
like the riots are happening everywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: there was chaos there was lockdown and
then COVID and where we lived it got
[SPEAKER_01]: really strict and they had us on curfew
every night there was driving restrictions
[SPEAKER_01]: and the beaches were closed and it was
like really hectic and around that time
[SPEAKER_01]: for whatever reason those guys just
stopped talking to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's because I made a
political post that was like against this
[SPEAKER_01]: administration that had just gotten voted
in or whatever it was not like I was on
[SPEAKER_01]: either side because I don't think either
side are good they're all evil both
[SPEAKER_01]: political parties and like I'm directly in
the middle of they both have their both
[SPEAKER_01]: they both have their good things and bad
things but I'm definitely not on either
[SPEAKER_01]: side so for whatever reason I made some
stupid post about anti-Hillary and
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-Biden and anti-China and it was kind
of like a meme I guess at the time and
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately I got kinds of like shit for
it I got people DMing me telling me I'm a
[SPEAKER_01]: scumbag Trump-er I had people DMing me
telling me to fuck off and then follow me
[SPEAKER_01]: and never want to talk to me again type
thing and that seemed to be around the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time that I like lost those guys as
far as like followers go as far as like
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt Wright and not so Doug and some of
those other guys so I don't know if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: on me over that or what it was but you
know as far as the dates go and my age for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure I was 17 on my first trip and that
was 1989 and the second trip I was a
[SPEAKER_01]: little lost on it first but that was
definitely 1993 and at that cannabis cup
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone that was there would remember there
was as you walked in the doorway there was
[SPEAKER_01]: these two big plants growing there were
live flowering plants and I remember
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically they were Durbin poison
because a friend of mine over I went there
[SPEAKER_01]: we had like snuck like walked up and
grabbed a little nugget off one and put in
[SPEAKER_01]: his pocket thinking I was gonna dry out on
that trip we get to actually try some
[SPEAKER_01]: Durbin poison but as anyone knows in
Amsterdam in November which is when the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis couple was back then is so wet
and rainy out that like nothing was dry
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have to have dehumidifier to get
anything dry there so yeah I don't know if
[SPEAKER_01]: those guys could be the reason why they're
talking shit I've had plenty of
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations with him and I actually
found my conversations with him at some
[SPEAKER_01]: point and basically in the conversation I
told him straight up we were popping seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: from the seed bank and from Sensei seeds
you know I never I might not have told him
[SPEAKER_01]: I went there twice or whatever it was
because the second trip wasn't really
[SPEAKER_01]: related to the OG triangle story or I
don't know that might have been a reason
[SPEAKER_01]: why I didn't say I went there twice or but
I definitely went there twice the second
[SPEAKER_01]: time was more for fun and I went to chill
and relax and have my own money that trip
[SPEAKER_01]: and went for almost two weeks with some
friends and had a good time and that trip
[SPEAKER_01]: we bought back like I said the bubble gum
aka 47 at that point in time the seed bank
[SPEAKER_01]: was closed I guess because Sensei seed he
got in trouble everyone knows about and
[SPEAKER_01]: then Sensei seeds had bought them out and
they were still working out of the castle
[SPEAKER_01]: but at the time they opened up a new store
and like real close to where we were
[SPEAKER_01]: staying like walking distance across from
like the cannabis museum or hint museum I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanna say so that's where we shot some
Sensei seed genetics that trip and we also
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said we brought stuff from the CIA
from the Duns crew and I think we even
[SPEAKER_01]: stumbled across some seeds that like a
little like random head shop somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: that was selling mushrooms and they had a
bunch of like they had like purple star
[SPEAKER_01]: and a few different random things that we
grabbed out of there too seed wise that's
[SPEAKER_00]: great to hear the the storyline and you
know I can I can appreciate the response
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure I mean their parties that they
had at the Hammer Cup were super sick I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean it was it was Matt Reyes parties at
the time along with a couple of his
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and his crew you know what's funny
I think I was at that one you referenced
[SPEAKER_00]: the 2019 one I'm bummed I didn't bump into
you well it was like I like a vineyard
[SPEAKER_00]: like a grape vineyard or something yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah the long driveway so
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah you didn't see Josh D there that
night oh I probably did but I was pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: stoned so yeah I was with him and a couple
of his crew and I know Fletch from Archive
[SPEAKER_01]: was there that night that's been the first
time I got to see the Moonbowl that he
[SPEAKER_01]: brought like a bunch of jars of and that's
too bad we didn't get to meet that night
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a fun party yeah shout out to Matt
and the Canilluminati that party was
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome so yeah good to hear your side of
the story for sure let's go back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: storyline so you've sold these you know
these bags that have the seeds in it and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gone how did that progress because
you've mentioned a few times you moved to
[SPEAKER_00]: South America how did you sort of progress
to that after you know the inception of
[SPEAKER_01]: the TKNOG all right so I had moved from
Jupiter which gets a lot I moved to
[SPEAKER_01]: Jupiter in 1994 like I said about my first
house there and I stayed there until 1999
[SPEAKER_01]: the house there I had gotten I got chased
out of there basically by lightning bolt I
[SPEAKER_01]: had a stolen power parade going on I had
to actually take a year off from growing
[SPEAKER_01]: because some of the older guys I knew in
South Florida were having some issues and
[SPEAKER_01]: there was a lot of heat going on so I took
a while off and during that time I was
[SPEAKER_01]: making surf videos and I started this I
partnered with this company it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: friend of mine that started this company
called Crypto Clothing it was a around
[SPEAKER_01]: like the late 80s and most of the 90s it
was surf based but like also weed related
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was him taking his art put him on
shirts and then I joined in with another
[SPEAKER_01]: friend and so for a couple years I kept
moms alive somewhere but I didn't grow any
[SPEAKER_01]: flower and we tried to run that company
while there was a lot of heat in South
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida and I was trying to stay cool this
is when I was in Jupiter so at that point
[SPEAKER_01]: I started growing again I think close to
98 99 I want to say and randomly one day I
[SPEAKER_01]: never had stolen power in that house
before but for whatever reason it was I
[SPEAKER_01]: was broke and I was getting desperate and
I had a friend that knew how to steal
[SPEAKER_01]: power and do the power rig so we set up my
house that way and the day we were doing
[SPEAKER_01]: it there was a storm rolling in with
lightning and stuff it was sketchy so we
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of rushed the job drilled the holes
to the wall and ran the whole thing
[SPEAKER_01]: through the meter to the to a panel inside
the house that he built me so I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: if we didn't ground it right because we
were rushing that day or whatever but
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe I don't know like a month into a
batch that I had set up in the garage the
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 lights while living there I was on a
phone one day this is when we had court
[SPEAKER_01]: phone still and I'm on the phone with a
telemarketer trying to get this lady off
[SPEAKER_01]: the phone and there's a bad storm going on
lightning hitting and crashing and thunder
[SPEAKER_01]: and like I tower they look like I don't
want what you're selling so hang the phone
[SPEAKER_01]: up and the second I hang the phone on the
wall lightning struck the house and
[SPEAKER_01]: basically he's out half the line coming
into the property there's two lines coming
[SPEAKER_01]: in and it's after one of them so
immediately I knew something was up the
[SPEAKER_01]: house started like dimming and going
through kinds of little power surges and I
[SPEAKER_01]: started smelling burning wires so I had to
go unplug everything immediately and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was a full emergency mode basically so
like the power lines where they met from
[SPEAKER_01]: the outside of my house got struck by the
lightning out there and melted it
[SPEAKER_01]: completely so one of the lines coming into
the house was still working while the
[SPEAKER_01]: other one wasn't so I had to take
everything off that one leg and basically
[SPEAKER_01]: I was broke at the time and I was just
trying to get this batch done and I still
[SPEAKER_01]: had a couple weeks to go so I took like 10
lights worth of plants and ran them all
[SPEAKER_01]: into one room under two lights or three
lights at a time and trying to finish them
[SPEAKER_01]: off under the melting burning stinky power
in the house which was super sketchy and
[SPEAKER_01]: fire I had it all time but I finished it
got that out of there cleaned the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: house up and I had basically the guy came
over we undid the power but at this point
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to shoot holes in the wall and I was
sketched out in the power company as
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna see and you know they're
gonna come out fix it they're gonna have
[SPEAKER_01]: to open my meter so I waited till like a
Friday evening when everyone was like
[SPEAKER_01]: dying to go home from work and I called
the power company and told them my story
[SPEAKER_01]: that I needed help the place got struck by
lightning so they sent a crew out they get
[SPEAKER_01]: up there on the roof like no gloves or
nothing they just like fix the shit up
[SPEAKER_01]: like super fast never opened my meter and
it was done so I took that as an omen like
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole lightning thing and I was like
already been in that house from 94 and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been like five years I was already
sketched out from being in South Florida
[SPEAKER_01]: where some of those guys had started
getting in trouble so at that point I
[SPEAKER_01]: decided to move north another hour to work
Craig and that whole crew was basically
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's basically in Florida we had the
Bahamas that block a lot of the surf from
[SPEAKER_01]: hitting the southern beaches but up there
in central Florida we get a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent surf because the waves get
around the Bahama Bank so I always went up
[SPEAKER_01]: there surfing my whole life and it was
just a matter of time before I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: move up there and I did so it was 99 was
when I bought my house up there so 99 till
[SPEAKER_01]: 2011 I was living in Brevard County and I
was buying houses I bought all the owner
[SPEAKER_01]: finance when I first moved up there and
then I started growing another house I
[SPEAKER_01]: rented and from there I bought another
house and I started doing little fixer
[SPEAKER_01]: uppers and this is before the economy or
the real estate market they took a crash
[SPEAKER_01]: this is like early 2000s and there this is
when they were giving out loans like candy
[SPEAKER_01]: like here in America I don't know about
there but I basically got a loan for a
[SPEAKER_01]: $400,000 house hardly showing any income
there's like no income verification by
[SPEAKER_01]: then so you could just say how much you
made told the banker and they sign you you
[SPEAKER_01]: know long you got the money they sign you
up and you're good to go so I got this
[SPEAKER_01]: big-ass house up there in the north side
of the county it was like a three-car
[SPEAKER_01]: garage huge four-bedroom on two acres of
property brand-new construction and that
[SPEAKER_01]: was 2004 it was and that was the house
that would end up getting busted that but
[SPEAKER_01]: at first I was there from 2004 so it's
2011 and that's when they got me so during
[SPEAKER_01]: that time frame I was growing in the
triangle juicy fruit g13 I had some white
[SPEAKER_01]: widow some of those hash plants still
around super scum hash plan I saw my
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier and yeah it was that house one day
that they would come get me at basically
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody took them off and this was under
the Obama administration where at the time
[SPEAKER_01]: they changed the rules where they can come
in your house without a warrant based on
[SPEAKER_01]: saying that they smelled something outside
by the road and they used that to get in
[SPEAKER_01]: my place so yeah they tied me up for a
solid four years a little longer and then
[SPEAKER_01]: after that was over with and I got off
house arrest and probation I actually got
[SPEAKER_01]: probation a year early luckily and we
moved down to Latin America at that point
[SPEAKER_01]: my girlfriend I was been with for 13 years
now she was from Columbia and she was all
[SPEAKER_01]: on board and moving down there she spoke
perfect she's bilingual three different
[SPEAKER_01]: languages and yeah as soon as they got off
I got a probation I got my passport
[SPEAKER_01]: renewed through the website versus waiting
for the courts give it back to me and
[SPEAKER_01]: within a couple weeks I went down there
and started prepping for us to move down
[SPEAKER_01]: there basically and what was life like
down there it was awesome the first and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was awesome in the end too but there was a
point somewhere in that first year where
[SPEAKER_01]: we had a home invasion and at this point
we had given up everything in Florida I
[SPEAKER_01]: lost everything I had the foreclosures
like we sold everything we had in garage
[SPEAKER_01]: sales and we pretty much gave up our life
in Florida and moved down there and I had
[SPEAKER_01]: two places down there at the time and we
moved from one we lived in one for six
[SPEAKER_01]: months and I was growing there everything
was fine and then we moved to the bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: place which was older and it wasn't really
up to date it needed new windows it needed
[SPEAKER_01]: like new security and whatever so within a
couple months of living in that big house
[SPEAKER_01]: they're like compounds they had like walls
around them the one did and the next door
[SPEAKER_01]: there was four houses with some friends of
mine and we all built a project together
[SPEAKER_01]: and I had one of those places next door so
we moved from the smaller house to the big
[SPEAKER_01]: house me and my girlfriend at the time and
I don't know within a few months of living
[SPEAKER_01]: there one late night I hear the dogs
barking outside and we're going to bed
[SPEAKER_01]: like midnight I look out the front door or
the front window and I see a little blue
[SPEAKER_01]: flashing light at our driveway at our gate
look like a cop light and I wasn't growing
[SPEAKER_01]: in the house we're living in but there's
something going on next door that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: worried about and I had weed in the house
and I think we had a separated garage that
[SPEAKER_01]: had something like equipment maybe some
trim in it so I was a little nervous when
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the blue light out there and next
thing you know and the headlights I see
[SPEAKER_01]: all these bodies running towards us
towards the house and I screamed my
[SPEAKER_01]: girlfriend like I think the cops are here
I think the cops are here and it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: like that they started smashing the front
door a couple of them went around the back
[SPEAKER_01]: they temper sprayed one of the dogs we had
on the property to get by them they got in
[SPEAKER_01]: the sliding glass door and grabbed me put
me in cuffs basically cover my face and
[SPEAKER_01]: put me on the ground they grabbed my chick
it was in the other room and that's kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like how to separate it at first and I
thought we were basically getting raided
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're all wearing police
uniforms they all had guns they all had
[SPEAKER_01]: masks on they're wearing like the
reflector or uniform like bulletproof vest
[SPEAKER_01]: looking uniforms they all look official so
that was scary shit and you know we're in
[SPEAKER_01]: a third world country thinking we're
getting busted so at some point I start
[SPEAKER_01]: peeking around and I seen they had my
girlfriend tied up in like speaker wire
[SPEAKER_01]: not handcuffs and immediately that looked
fishy to me and I was like what the fuck's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on and then I looked around a little
more and they're kicking me and like
[SPEAKER_01]: telling me not to look but they're like
stealing shit out of the house they're
[SPEAKER_01]: asking me for money and and weed or where
the weed was and where the money was in
[SPEAKER_01]: Spanish and my girlfriend's translated me
like look they're gonna fucking kill us if
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't give them something which you
know they picked the worst possible time
[SPEAKER_01]: to come because we had like three hours
cash and I had maybe a couple ounces of
[SPEAKER_01]: weed the garage I said has some like has
some these old Mars hydro LEDs that
[SPEAKER_01]: weighed like a hundred pounds each it felt
like they took those they took the bag of
[SPEAKER_01]: trim that was out in the garage they cut
open our house looking for money like
[SPEAKER_01]: they're adamant to find something but they
couldn't so at some point we had the we
[SPEAKER_01]: had four rottweilers at the time and that
buddy of mine that was living there for
[SPEAKER_01]: years before we moved there started
collecting these dollars and bringing them
[SPEAKER_01]: down there and lived there with four huge
rotties so we had one on our property that
[SPEAKER_01]: was old and three were next door where the
other houses were and they're all younger
[SPEAKER_01]: and acting super mean and barking at the
walls when the guys trying to get over
[SPEAKER_01]: there so they had my girlfriend and
they're asking her to like let them over
[SPEAKER_01]: and they asked me to let them over and I
was acting like I didn't know any Spanish
[SPEAKER_01]: which I kind of didn't at the time and
basically we both said the same story in
[SPEAKER_01]: different rooms like they're not our dogs
they're super mean I wouldn't trust them
[SPEAKER_01]: and I don't I can't get over there myself
this basically the story we told them so
[SPEAKER_01]: they kept taking stuff from the house I
had like a I think I had a brand new mini
[SPEAKER_01]: split unit they see in a box that they
took that was like the most valuable thing
[SPEAKER_01]: they found and at some point in time it
just got silent like they all left I think
[SPEAKER_01]: they heard some some noise on this on
their police scanner that something was
[SPEAKER_01]: going on or maybe somebody had heard
something or whatever so they all left in
[SPEAKER_01]: a hurry and it just became like super
quiet and eerie there's no sound of dogs
[SPEAKER_01]: or noises going on anymore and like I got
the handcuffs in front of me and I went
[SPEAKER_01]: out and tied her and we went for help went
next door and they never got next door
[SPEAKER_01]: luckily thanks to those dogs I went to
grab my friend who never heard a thing
[SPEAKER_01]: because in the next door we had
bulletproof glass and the place is really
[SPEAKER_01]: more modern and newer and rural and
efficient so he never heard a thing going
[SPEAKER_01]: on at the house so I went over there and
he cut the cuffs off me with their bull
[SPEAKER_01]: cutters and basically that was just like a
full of nightmare so I had to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: decision if we're gonna stay down there we
go back to Florida what we're gonna do
[SPEAKER_01]: because we like I said we've given up
everything at that point in Florida and
[SPEAKER_01]: living down there was it was beautiful you
know but just this shit happened but like
[SPEAKER_01]: I said I felt like because they didn't get
anything they didn't find anything or see
[SPEAKER_01]: anything going on that we were kind of in
a clear I felt like a bit so I decided to
[SPEAKER_01]: make the call to stay down there and we
went ahead and like fixed up the house and
[SPEAKER_01]: I got new windows and new bars on the
doors and cameras I got a couple of guns
[SPEAKER_01]: and we had another dog or two to our pack
and we made the call to stay I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: grow in there anymore obviously after that
but we made the decision to stay there and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know after a while things started to
like dust started to settle and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: going about normal again to this day if a
bark a barking dog is outside at night my
[SPEAKER_01]: fiance she jumps up in her sleep and
freaks out she's got PTSD badly from that
[SPEAKER_01]: but other than that you know we were left
we made it through safe I actually had a
[SPEAKER_01]: gun in my head and they're doing a
countdown multiple times talking about if
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't give us the weed and the drugs
or the drugs and the money we're basically
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna kill you and I just didn't know what
was going on I was playing stupid and
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow we made it through that night
that's incredible I mean you know I can
[SPEAKER_00]: totally understand why your girlfriend
would be so traumatized that sounds very
[SPEAKER_00]: intense to say the least and yeah staying
down there bold move how did how did that
[SPEAKER_00]: play out we were you were you growing at a
different place because you say you
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't growing there were you growing
somewhere else and selling the weed
[SPEAKER_01]: locally well I had a little house next
door that was grown in and that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're trying to get to you but like I
said the Rottweilers kept them out and we
[SPEAKER_01]: were selling the weed to Americans that
live down there people that would come and
[SPEAKER_01]: go traveling I had a friend at a
restaurant there that he would help out we
[SPEAKER_01]: had a good amount of friends that live
there for years too that would you know it
[SPEAKER_01]: moved pretty good and actually the prices
stayed nice and high there for years too
[SPEAKER_01]: and so later on somebody from California
started shipping containers of weed down
[SPEAKER_01]: there and brought the prices down from
like four thousand a pound to like two
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand overnight so there was that but
actually now it's legal down there in this
[SPEAKER_01]: in the country we're in I think it's at
least medical and it's getting ready for
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational soon I want to say so things
have changed when we were there if you
[SPEAKER_01]: would have gotten caught you know you're
looking at some third-world jail and
[SPEAKER_01]: prison time and definitely way sketchier
than doing time here in America hmm
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly certainly so what was it that
stimulated you to make the return to
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida well somewhere later on actually
was a coded and the whole lockdown thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that we thought where we were was going to
be super like lenient and like easygoing
[SPEAKER_01]: but for whatever reason they became like
super strict and tyrannical like they had
[SPEAKER_01]: nightly perfumes and the beaches were
closed and there was even surfers were
[SPEAKER_01]: getting shot at by the cops were like
going surfing a couple of times so at some
[SPEAKER_01]: point you started to get sick of it they
had the borders closed so we kind of felt
[SPEAKER_01]: trapped you know at the time so I made a
decision that as soon as the borders were
[SPEAKER_01]: open again we were going to try and make
the call to go somewhere else and at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time I was thinking Florida California I
wasn't sure but we ended up selling with
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida the reason we chose Florida also
because at this point in time I was
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to somebody after I came out who
was working in a company and in Miami
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida and they were building a huge grow
with intentions of getting a license from
[SPEAKER_01]: the next round of license that licenses
that Florida was supposed to give out
[SPEAKER_01]: because in the beginning when they gave
out their original amount it was only 22
[SPEAKER_01]: and there was all vertical so 20 large
corporations involved in Florida and they
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't get one at that time for whatever
reason so they were waiting on the next
[SPEAKER_01]: batch and Florida kept kicking the can
down the road down the road further and
[SPEAKER_01]: further and it kept dragging on so that's
like when they opened the borders in
[SPEAKER_01]: Central America they we got back here to
Florida actually I found a house on
[SPEAKER_01]: Pregasus and it was owner finance which
always worked out good for me and because
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't think I had credit and I didn't
have that much money at the time so we
[SPEAKER_01]: found this place like Pregasus on owner
finance deal and it was during the
[SPEAKER_01]: lockdown so I couldn't even actually see
it in person we had a friend come and
[SPEAKER_01]: check out the place and do an inspection
for us we did a deal that seemed sketchy
[SPEAKER_01]: through a small title company and I
thought we were getting robbed at some
[SPEAKER_01]: point but it all went through and worked
out so the guy in Miami I was talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about they had the company they were still
waiting on their license but he made it
[SPEAKER_01]: sound like within a year they would have
it for sure and you know I've been to the
[SPEAKER_01]: I visited their grow a couple of times
from from where we're living and it has
[SPEAKER_01]: super you know high-tech thousand light
giant building and they're doing all these
[SPEAKER_01]: big rooms and stuff and so it seemed for
sure they're gonna get it just matter of
[SPEAKER_01]: time so my mind and we're coming back to
work there do some sort of a deal with him
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they're gonna grow my genetics
and maybe launch my brand there and that
[SPEAKER_01]: was the plan anyway so a year went by and
they never got the license yet and still
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't gotten to this day and at some
point in time actually was a couple years
[SPEAKER_01]: gone by since then but I had to sell one
of my places down there where we live in
[SPEAKER_01]: Central America and brought that money
back here and we were kind of living off
[SPEAKER_01]: that for a while and it was starting to
run out and these guys still hadn't got a
[SPEAKER_01]: license and things are starting to look
like where we're gonna go next and
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody I met one of the emerald cuffs
years prior actually the same year I think
[SPEAKER_01]: you're there that 2019 I want to say he's
one of these guys that's from Miami he's
[SPEAKER_01]: Dominican and Cuban and he's part of the
whole Washington Heights New York A's
[SPEAKER_01]: group so he's down here in Florida along
with another friend of his a partner that
[SPEAKER_01]: was Cuban and we all met at their moca
when we talked on social media all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time they seemed that nothing was going on
I was sitting around doing nothing and one
[SPEAKER_01]: of them hit me up this freedom town
holdings is the name of their company and
[SPEAKER_01]: they got a they got a deal with one of the
big companies here I guess the first five
[SPEAKER_01]: were grandfathered in the chance or the
opportunity to hire outside help to manage
[SPEAKER_01]: their growth form so they got a deal with
one of the big companies here to build a
[SPEAKER_01]: group row and then run it for us run and
basically produce the flower for this big
[SPEAKER_01]: company so they hit me up and they're like
hey I see you're not working for the other
[SPEAKER_01]: guys yeah they haven't got license yet and
want to come talk with us maybe so that's
[SPEAKER_01]: how that started so I went to visit their
grow and we started conversations back and
[SPEAKER_01]: forth about what we could do and how this
might work and back and forth for a few
[SPEAKER_01]: months and like I said the money was
starting to run out I was painting as much
[SPEAKER_01]: as I can and trying to live off art my my
fiance she teaches yoga so we were just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of getting by paying our bills and
living here in Florida and then this
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity came along so since I couldn't
legally grow here without worrying about
[SPEAKER_01]: things again now I have you know I have a
record now so at this point I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to take a chance so she didn't want me to
do it either so I jumped on the legal game
[SPEAKER_01]: and took these guys up on their offer and
since then we've worked out something
[SPEAKER_01]: where you know it's like I get some
royalties from them growing my genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: and they have them all throughout the
state I visit the grow every week and we
[SPEAKER_01]: talked every day you know via cell phone
or videophone or whatever it might be I go
[SPEAKER_01]: there as much as I can it's a couple hours
away from me or I go there every day
[SPEAKER_01]: otherwise but yeah that's that's how that
whole thing started so I jumped from one
[SPEAKER_01]: company to another the other company I was
really gonna work for they still haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: got the license and there's you know they
got the grow sitting there just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like collecting dust now I guess they're
finishing up and they should be getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: license soon but if I had waited for them
we would have been dead broke and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: back to Latin America by now Wow that's an
interesting journey you've come along and
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have any plans for the future I
know you've mentioned the name origin
[SPEAKER_01]: select to me well yeah that's the brand
that we got going on here now so origin
[SPEAKER_01]: selects is like a side brand within
freedom town holdings so that fluent which
[SPEAKER_01]: is statewide they have like 33 locations
now and basically it's it's a small menu
[SPEAKER_01]: of my personal favorites including
triangle push there's a og push on there a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of different ones we have we have a
bunch of stuff that we're finding from my
[SPEAKER_01]: siege right now we did some big seed hunts
like a hundred each we have a wild G that
[SPEAKER_01]: we have we're about to pick a couple of
which is a wildlife cross with og push and
[SPEAKER_01]: that came from Josh and his crew we have
Tahiti line cross with a lemon rail which
[SPEAKER_01]: we're calling Tahiti twist but then the
state made us change it because it sounds
[SPEAKER_01]: too much like a candy so now it's gonna be
Tahiti Royale that was what it's something
[SPEAKER_01]: I made down there in Latin America too
then we have a handful of others basically
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're all pretty much TK or OG
related I'm gonna try and work on getting
[SPEAKER_01]: some seeds made with that Colombian gold
Panama red that I told you about earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: with those guys hopefully that'd be nice
search some of those and some of the guys
[SPEAKER_01]: at the freedom town they're all the haze
things they have a lot of hazes that they
[SPEAKER_01]: grow there they have like a Mexican
lemonade and a cake boss and a few
[SPEAKER_01]: different things that are like haze
related to take a little longer to finish
[SPEAKER_01]: so they're trying to keep haze is going on
in the market here and at first the og's
[SPEAKER_01]: here they didn't really take off super
fast and I didn't expect them to because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's more of a California thing but like
once people started to hear the story a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more and actually go in and try
some of the flower you know it's starting
[SPEAKER_01]: to build up a little bit of momentum now
and they're selling out a lot faster the
[SPEAKER_01]: first couple batches actually were like I
told you about the hurricane earlier we
[SPEAKER_01]: had some stress from the hurricane and the
first couple batches were plants that got
[SPEAKER_01]: beat up from the hurricanes and then the
building was still not up to par we were
[SPEAKER_01]: fixing rooms and ACs and chillers were not
working properly and TO2 kept going and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know it sounds like the Millennium
Falcon from Star Wars like it worked great
[SPEAKER_01]: but you had to like keep working on it and
keep banging things around and fixing
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that's our like our common joke
about the building that's cool to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know from the the story as well
as that you got the the menu curated by
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and I like that we hear a little
bit about some sativas in the mix I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know if you've actually said it yet do you
have a soft spot for sativas at all or are
[SPEAKER_01]: you just more of like an indica dude um
like I said earlier I like mixing things
[SPEAKER_01]: up I don't know it's something I've always
done I guess the more flavor that I have
[SPEAKER_01]: in my collection the better at all given
times so I always have some sort of sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: around yeah I definitely have a soft spot
for some good sativa I never like thrown
[SPEAKER_01]: it indoors as opposed to smoking it
because usually grown the good ones
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors or you know you're talking a
hundred plus days and here in Florida we
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't really have that option a lot of
times because you know once things got
[SPEAKER_01]: stinky it was time to like start worrying
about taking things down before your
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbor started learning what was going
on so because of that we never even let
[SPEAKER_01]: the triangle or the OG well not the OG but
the triangle I never let back in the day
[SPEAKER_01]: go beyond 60 days I think was the max 56
60 days and it was just because the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: house was starting to stink around the
property and your gate and your doorway
[SPEAKER_01]: and at that point you started getting
panicky and you start taking things down
[SPEAKER_01]: early I guess so I never even actually ran
it a full length back then I even had a
[SPEAKER_01]: east coast sour diesel for a while back
then too that was one of the original cuts
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think we got that around 94 or no
excuse me 2004 and I ran that one side by
[SPEAKER_01]: side with the triangle a lot and it came
down to 60 days a lot of times too but it
[SPEAKER_01]: was still mostly white hairs and whatever
reason still tasted banging it was
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone loved it but I never really got a
chance to run that a full like 75 or 80
[SPEAKER_01]: days the triangle we've been running in
some different rooms here we went 80 days
[SPEAKER_01]: on it recently and it didn't like that
like after 70 started to get bleaching and
[SPEAKER_01]: start freaking out a bit didn't already
look that great again compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms that come down I like 65 70 yeah I
was gonna ask you in fact you know I hear
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of varying answers I myself I love
OG
[SPEAKER_01]: well I was just saying now that we could
actually run them longer I like 65 to 70
[SPEAKER_01]: that's my sweet spot personally when I was
down there in Latin America growing them I
[SPEAKER_01]: was pretty much at 65 days on average back
in the day of the TK we didn't have like
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a carpet filters came around I
forget when it was close to like around
[SPEAKER_01]: 2000 I want to say so I think prior to
that was just super odor like stinky
[SPEAKER_01]: problems outside your house so you always
had to worry about that especially like
[SPEAKER_01]: those those pencils I'm out earlier the
super strong houseplants a lot of people I
[SPEAKER_01]: know actually got busted for growing like
a single light of those those genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the day and like a lot of money
got probation for the small small batches
[SPEAKER_01]: but I would pull up to a couple of friends
houses and like our windows open just all
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff like blocks away like holy shit
you gotta get this out of here now so but
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah back then before carbon filters
everything came down sooner than it should
[SPEAKER_01]: have obviously it was just because of
smell we used to make these big garbage
[SPEAKER_01]: cans with pine soul and we cut a bunch of
drill a bunch of holes around the top of
[SPEAKER_01]: the garbage can and put a box fan on top
you know fill the thing up as much as you
[SPEAKER_01]: can halfway with like pine soul that was
our like makeshift smell cover the time
[SPEAKER_01]: along with like maybe some ozone machines
back then that were super unhealthy to
[SPEAKER_01]: breathe like that I just hate hated that
stuff like we had them over the doorways
[SPEAKER_01]: of our houses but they didn't really do
much but they give you a sore throat and I
[SPEAKER_01]: think carbon filters came around closer to
like 98 99 I want to say or something
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a little sooner but we weren't
getting under the swords here until later
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking of carbon filters I never knew
they were full a little tiny charcoal bees
[SPEAKER_01]: inside so I got busted and the cops
basically had fun on my house with
[SPEAKER_01]: sledgehammers and just destroyed by like
six large carbon filters and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: spread across the entire house these
little charcoal like babies that basically
[SPEAKER_01]: stained everything all the carpets all the
tile the walls I gave us some mess it took
[SPEAKER_00]: like a month to clean that house wow
that's intense so a few questions ago we
[SPEAKER_00]: were talking about sativas and I
definitely wanted to ask you because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed how talented you are at art how
has cannabis affected your creativity and
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically your art do you find specific
strains you know interact with your
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to create art differently to
others and what's your take on the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis influencing art oh absolutely
like as long as I've been enjoying
[SPEAKER_01]: painting it's always had to be weed
involved so normally I would have my bong
[SPEAKER_01]: and my lighter or I use an urbire now
because I don't like butane from the
[SPEAKER_01]: lighters anymore and so that was always
part of the process basically that's you
[SPEAKER_01]: know getting super high whether it's tiva
or indigo or whatever would be that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where my ideas would come from at first it
started off my painting started off as
[SPEAKER_01]: like a surf break around the world and I
was usually just giving them out to
[SPEAKER_01]: friends or you know like it's presence or
whatever it's a family here on holidays
[SPEAKER_01]: and over time they once I got involved
with that clothing company I told you
[SPEAKER_01]: about earlier crypto clothing in the 90s
that's when I started to put a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more effort into creating paintings of
like beach scapes and surf spots and
[SPEAKER_01]: putting them on shirts and that's when it
kind of gave me a little bit more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: spark to like start painting for a living
and like a side job kind of thing which I
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoyed and yeah I've definitely always
done when I smoke or when I painted I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: there's always part of the process for
sure and since I came out in the last five
[SPEAKER_01]: years I never painted weed before because
I never thought it would really be
[SPEAKER_01]: something that would sell or people would
be interested in but once I started
[SPEAKER_01]: painting a couple canvas plants here and
there I gave one or two away to the guy
[SPEAKER_01]: that was gonna do the Miami farm and get
me down there they're gonna probably still
[SPEAKER_01]: have them on their office walls once they
get them up and running but it was later
[SPEAKER_01]: on after that actually that I think I like
given Josh a painting and a couple other
[SPEAKER_01]: people the next thing you know I was
getting a lot of compliments and started
[SPEAKER_01]: painting more and then a couple original
started selling and started getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: little demand for it so now just I don't
paint beach scenes or waves anymore it's
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much a mixture of we I've been
trying to do some like different theme
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff with like jaws and astronaut holding
a plan on the moon and stuff like that so
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah everyone's been loving that kind of
stuff and actually because of these theme
[SPEAKER_01]: weed projects that actually helped me get
my deal here in Florida because those 33
[SPEAKER_01]: stores that I'm selling my product out of
they want to have art in all the stores
[SPEAKER_01]: and put a QR code next to them and link
them to my website so I know it's slowly
[SPEAKER_01]: working on getting them to as many stores
I can I think we're in like four right now
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's gonna be more coming so yeah
that's been a good part of the process now
[SPEAKER_01]: and now that I incorporate a weed to my
painting Wow that's epic to hear and I
[SPEAKER_00]: highly encourage everyone to check out
your website or definitely at least the
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram there they're really awesome
looking artworks for cannabis I really
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy it myself I wrote down I forgot to
ask you earlier and I want to touch back
[SPEAKER_00]: on it before I forget you know way back at
the start of the episode you mentioned you
[SPEAKER_00]: had some experience with the creepy and I
wanted to hear a little more because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually one we haven't heard much about
even across all the episodes we've done
[SPEAKER_00]: with people you know no one's really ever
had too much knowledge about it did you
[SPEAKER_01]: know anything about it yeah that's a
that's almost like a whole episode itself
[SPEAKER_01]: but in a nutshell I can tell you that it
was some of the first weed I ever smoked
[SPEAKER_01]: like going back to that day I was skipping
in school and that guy gave me a ride to
[SPEAKER_01]: the beach with them and that they had met
all those people he actually had some
[SPEAKER_01]: creepy on him that day creepy with a K
basically because it was named that
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'd find out from him and other
people that the people that were growing
[SPEAKER_01]: it were surfers up here in central Florida
and they were like one of the guys was a
[SPEAKER_01]: pro surfer he's probably 20 years older
than me he actually won the pipeline
[SPEAKER_01]: Masters surf contest in Hawaii like in the
70s when like nobody from Florida was
[SPEAKER_01]: winning those things back then it was
strictly all Hawaiians or Australians so
[SPEAKER_01]: he was the first breakout person from
Florida that went a big event like that he
[SPEAKER_01]: happened to be growing the creepy up here
in central Florida and along with his crew
[SPEAKER_01]: so that was before my time I didn't really
know those guys that well I did know a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of his crew and younger friends that were
involved like there was a few pro surfers
[SPEAKER_01]: that that guy knew that I became friends
with years later a couple of them actually
[SPEAKER_01]: moved the same country I was living in in
Central America so that whole thing was
[SPEAKER_01]: around from I like to say 86 87 and then
those guys were growing it until around 89
[SPEAKER_01]: 90 when something happened where they got
busted and that was the last of that
[SPEAKER_01]: original kryptonite which it went by at
the time and it was based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: kryptonite from the Superman movies and
that's why it's spelled with a K and that
[SPEAKER_01]: name came about one day in a van with all
those same guys I was talking about up at
[SPEAKER_01]: Sebastian Island one day surfing and
smoking a joint and one of the guys named
[SPEAKER_01]: Pat who was a pro surfer at the time said
man this stuff is so strong it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: kryptonite from the movie Superman it was
like it would kill Superman you know so
[SPEAKER_01]: that was like their phrase and that's how
the name stuck so that was the same the
[SPEAKER_01]: first weed I ever seen that was just like
absolutely incredible that that guy that
[SPEAKER_01]: gave me a ride to the beach that day he
had like a bottle on him and on the way to
[SPEAKER_01]: the beach he was telling me the story
about it and he told me to ask me if I
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked first and of course I was like yes
and he told me to reach under the
[SPEAKER_01]: passenger seat I was sitting in and look
for a film can and I found it and pulled
[SPEAKER_01]: it out and sure enough it was loaded with
this neon green this vibrant sticky stinky
[SPEAKER_01]: weed that they call krippi so that was
like the first generation of krippi in
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida krippi short for kryptonite and
like I said it's spelled with a K so not
[SPEAKER_01]: many people knew that story about the van
and how it was named out of the Superman
[SPEAKER_01]: movies unless you knew some of those
people I guess involved so after those
[SPEAKER_01]: guys got busted around 90 I want to say
Miami mango and a couple other people I
[SPEAKER_01]: knew were getting a new batch of krippi
that was getting shipped in and I guess it
[SPEAKER_01]: just kind of took over the name because
the name was so popular and it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: catchy and at some point that name kind of
became like a household term in Florida
[SPEAKER_01]: for weed I guess because of that original
one was so good so the next one that
[SPEAKER_01]: started coming in that mango was talking
about and still talks about was shipped in
[SPEAKER_01]: supposedly I've heard stories I came from
Seattle area or from Portland somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: out there in the northwest and the reason
they say that is because it came in these
[SPEAKER_01]: TBC tubes wrapped in newspapers from out
there and I guess that's maybe that
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody said that they did that to throw
people off of where it came from but it
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely wasn't grown here that batch
that second second generation of krippi
[SPEAKER_01]: that was brought in or shipped in from
somewhere and that one was for some reason
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just about crazy prices like people
are sounding for 150 a quarter a time I
[SPEAKER_01]: think I want to say like even Miami mango
seller for like $500 an ounce all the time
[SPEAKER_01]: and doctors and lawyers and whoever had a
lot of money at the time versus scooping
[SPEAKER_01]: that shit up so that was the one that was
in the 90s and then at some point closer
[SPEAKER_01]: to 2000 there was another one came around
could be just be name-playing people you
[SPEAKER_01]: know using the name again of a popular
strain but then there's one called the
[SPEAKER_01]: Tampa krippi that a lot of people swear by
and I think pictures of that looks a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: like an OG type plan or something but
different you know like a little like me
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking I haven't tried that one
myself yet I've got seeded out at the
[SPEAKER_01]: trial one day soon but I haven't actually
tried that original Tampa version so yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: there's like three different versions of
the krippi and I even hear people adding a
[SPEAKER_01]: fourth one that makes saying there's one
that's kind of like hazy it smells like
[SPEAKER_01]: hay in my smoke which I haven't seen
anything like that yet yeah and then of
[SPEAKER_01]: course there's a guy out there in Hawaii
that claims his dad and created krippi and
[SPEAKER_01]: later find out it was actually the
crippler that they started calling the
[SPEAKER_01]: krippi after maybe chasing stories from
here in Florida or trying to add something
[SPEAKER_01]: to his story or whatever I don't know what
it was but I don't talk to that guy
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore so yeah that's basically that was
and then there was also the fact that like
[SPEAKER_01]: I said it became a household name so just
like Indo or Green Bud or Kind Bud or
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that krippi became like a term
that people have used for like anything
[SPEAKER_01]: that was good grown indoors and because of
that like when Alec Anderson first came on
[SPEAKER_01]: to a podcast years ago before hearing my
story him and Matt Berger Bubba basically
[SPEAKER_01]: told the podcast that they found the OG
seed in a bag of Florida krippi you know
[SPEAKER_01]: just using the term as loose you know like
household name like I thought about and
[SPEAKER_01]: they didn't really mean that came from a
actual strain called the krippi but
[SPEAKER_01]: basically that threw people off and that
might have been why that guy in Hawaii
[SPEAKER_01]: actually ran with that story and then
started telling everyone that the OG and
[SPEAKER_01]: TK actually came from his dad's krippi and
whatever so yeah there's that part of that
[SPEAKER_01]: story yeah the first time I ever saw the
krippi like I said I was 15 and the last
[SPEAKER_01]: time I've seen it was in the 90s the real
krippi yeah okay that makes sense because
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna ask you a lot of the times you
hear krippi mentioned it's often in
[SPEAKER_00]: relation to like some relationship to OG
so I guess the question is given what
[SPEAKER_00]: you've said that bud you got that day in
the film canister what was it like was it
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like OG I mean I was super young
then I just know that was super fire I
[SPEAKER_01]: seen it a few more times after that I
actually grabbed some bags here and there
[SPEAKER_01]: from my neighbor I want to say I think my
dad used to get it from him too possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: because I used to go to my dad's closet
wasn't well I find little like ounce bags
[SPEAKER_01]: that I would take a tiny little half grand
out of and take it to school with me and
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone I've seen it was blown away I
remember it was just like some of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: neon green you'd ever seen and it
definitely had it kind of did have
[SPEAKER_01]: actually like a big OG kind of structure
like in the sense that it was like big
[SPEAKER_01]: acorn shaped I guess I want to say but
just different it had way more kick I
[SPEAKER_01]: think it did to it back then you know back
then I was younger and you know you got
[SPEAKER_01]: the thing with nostalgia maybe if I seen
it now maybe not as good as it seemed back
[SPEAKER_01]: then to me or whatever but everybody I
knew back then that's what talked to that
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to get it swears by that being
still some of the best stuff they've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: seen even some older guys I know so one
guy actually I knew that lives up here on
[SPEAKER_01]: the beach that I used to be friends with
and go surf at his house all the time he
[SPEAKER_01]: bought like a pound of it before they got
busted and he kept that thing for like two
[SPEAKER_01]: years like yeah I guess he had it buried
on his property or something and he'd pull
[SPEAKER_01]: out like a quarter ounce at a time or
maybe it was frozen he would pull a
[SPEAKER_01]: quarter ounce at a time so like for a
couple years after it had gone away I
[SPEAKER_01]: would see and smoke it at this guy's house
up here in the Melbourne beach area and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was just like you know I just remember
being like this big acorn shaped neon
[SPEAKER_01]: green nuggets that like I don't think they
had much like hairs or anything to them it
[SPEAKER_01]: was just kind of like all pod on pod but
real dense looking and it wasn't sealed
[SPEAKER_01]: out it wasn't the kind of stuff that was
being shipped in because definitely it was
[SPEAKER_01]: grown here I definitely know for a fact
like when those guys got busted growing
[SPEAKER_01]: here some of the people that were involved
like left Florida because they didn't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to get their family involved in the mess
that might have come later one of the guys
[SPEAKER_01]: dad was like a senator here in Florida
time so he went down to Central America
[SPEAKER_01]: his couple of his friends went to Central
America too at the same time I guess
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone kind of scattered but that
original guy that won the pipeline
[SPEAKER_01]: master's he definitely got busted in this
time he's actually still in Hawaii that
[SPEAKER_01]: guy goes by Crawford the last name his son
actually now is a surfer and he's served
[SPEAKER_01]: really well I think he's almost pro and I
just think he just wants to be left alone
[SPEAKER_01]: and people try to reach him to talk about
all this stuff with him and he's just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of to himself I actually have mutual
friends of his but I never met him myself
[SPEAKER_01]: people I talked to I've asked if they
could like reach out to him one day and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just never happened yet maybe one day
it will yeah hopefully one day I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone would love to hear it that's
interesting to hear all about the creepy
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah very interesting you mentioned
nostalgia in there and I wanted to ask you
[SPEAKER_00]: this question a lot of people I think look
at OG and TK to an extension as well in in
[SPEAKER_00]: a sense is sort of the last big name
before cookies really rolled onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: scene and just started to dominate
everything and some people have the view
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know we really started to
bottleneck a lot of genetics especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: the context of you know each strain seems
to be in that very dessert menu style sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of genetic lineage my question is would
you agree do you feel like we've started
[SPEAKER_00]: to bottleneck and more specifically do you
think OG and TK were like the last stop
[SPEAKER_00]: before that or do you think like that's
not necessarily the case I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: good things have come across or come
around since then I would say but like as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as the OG or as far as the cookies and
gelatos and stuff goes I'm not the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: fan of most of them but I've definitely
come across some really good crosses like
[SPEAKER_01]: in Skittles this Y-O-G-S sign which just
incorporates wildlife which is like cherry
[SPEAKER_01]: pie so those are really good I've come
across but they're also across with OG so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not like a direct cookie by itself
which cookie has OG in it too so I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: that's in there but I know you're saying
it's basically I hear the same thing a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people about the breeding is going too
far in that direction and most of the West
[SPEAKER_01]: Coast is just kind of leaning towards the
purple gelatos and those kind of genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: lately that's what everyone's breeding
with actually I have friends that are on
[SPEAKER_01]: the legal market out there and like they
can't sell anything that's green like
[SPEAKER_01]: everything they grow has to be purple or
the buyers come and they just like pass it
[SPEAKER_01]: up and they're wanting to buy it but they
basically have to sell something green for
[SPEAKER_01]: like a thousand dollars less a pound type
thing so that's part of it pretty sure
[SPEAKER_01]: because such you know the West Coast lays
a big part in this whole weed thing and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know they have a lot of hip-hop scene
you know a lot of rap culture pretty sure
[SPEAKER_01]: you know burner from cookies and a lot of
people have a big part of all that as far
[SPEAKER_01]: as like making these genetics blow up like
they did and the rappers all singing about
[SPEAKER_01]: them and the sherbets and this that the
other so yeah it's hard to say that
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's it's being bottlenecked in
that direction completely but I mean I
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely in the underground scene
there's definitely a lot of people growing
[SPEAKER_01]: some radical sativas and mixing up you
know scums and stuff like that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: like Tom McCormick selling a bunch of
different seeds from like Northern Lights
[SPEAKER_01]: now and bringing back all those old
genetics and scums and there's definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of hazes getting mixed in the work
now now that New York's going on up there
[SPEAKER_01]: they love the hazes so like my buddy here
that one of the owners of the company he's
[SPEAKER_01]: from that scene up there like I said he's
got a friend up there named Whiteboy Kev
[SPEAKER_01]: and he came out of hiding recently too and
so he's all up in the scene he's he's one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Dominican crew that was selling the
PIF and the Black Haze are there for years
[SPEAKER_01]: so yeah I mean that's I was actually up at
an event up there recently and the scene
[SPEAKER_01]: up there is just blowing up like everyone
up there is buying shit loads of weed it's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably one of the biggest markets in
America right now even though they're
[SPEAKER_01]: fumbling their legal game and legal
licensing and all that stuff right now
[SPEAKER_01]: like the state keeps postponing everyone's
getting fucked the underground scene out
[SPEAKER_01]: there is crazy like we went to a PIF con
recently and it was just out of control
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone had tables like the flea market
just selling tons and tons of hazes and
[SPEAKER_01]: all kinds of exotics that like an African
haze are into and a couple like really
[SPEAKER_01]: cool plants you know that weren't just
strictly gelatos or whatever so it's good
[SPEAKER_01]: to see there's a mix of everything going
on right now I would say the West Coast
[SPEAKER_01]: market definitely is leaning towards that
more than everywhere else I would say yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: it is awesome to see you know the
resurgence of the haze and to an extent I
[SPEAKER_00]: seen like you know a lot of sour heads
given a bit of a push so really cool to
[SPEAKER_00]: see things coming around and I wanted to
ask you do you have any plans to make any
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds if so what sort of stuff would you
want to do I have a couple little collabs
[SPEAKER_01]: going on at the moment I'm still going
through seeds that I made myself while
[SPEAKER_01]: stuck on lockdowns but out of that stuff
we found a lot of interesting stuff from
[SPEAKER_01]: my venue here in Florida I have another
project going on which is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly OGs out west at the moment so yeah
I'm working on a few things I'd definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: like to get a little bit more into it and
start putting some other genetics together
[SPEAKER_01]: with the OG and TK like for example I was
talking about the Colombian gold Panama
[SPEAKER_01]: red would be a really nice process I think
to one of them so we're working on things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that I gave my buddy some TK pack
frost seeds that I had worked on a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: times so it's like actually BX2 now so
he's gonna try and find a couple now and
[SPEAKER_01]: now and there that we can maybe use and so
yeah there's a few projects going on yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: that's cool and I guess you know as a bit
of an extension who are some breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: whose work you admire or enjoy personally
I have gone through a nice collection of
[SPEAKER_01]: swamp boys gear archive seeds so when I
was living down there in Central America
[SPEAKER_01]: before I created origins I had reached out
to Chrome after hearing stories about
[SPEAKER_01]: those guys being related to the triangle
and at some point I realized that the guy
[SPEAKER_01]: we got our cut from was associated with
them or partners with them or worked with
[SPEAKER_01]: them or something they were just close
friends I guess so we hit it off at first
[SPEAKER_01]: and just before origins was around they
sent me a nice care package down there and
[SPEAKER_01]: out of those I found the lemon were out to
be my favorite I found a real nice email
[SPEAKER_01]: and I found a male I made a bunch of seeds
with that male a couple other males I had
[SPEAKER_01]: down there like a donkey dog OG and
actually Matt Wright gave me a banana tie
[SPEAKER_01]: which I found this male from I had a
platinum shirt and a couple other males
[SPEAKER_01]: that I collected pollen and little like
projects here and there it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: paintbrush projects and actually did a
couple closets that I set up a male the
[SPEAKER_01]: lemon Royale and a male of a donkey dog so
all the seeds I made down there were small
[SPEAKER_01]: projects but made a lot more than I
expected to after some of the stuff was
[SPEAKER_01]: archives work too I had his pure loco and
his Tahiti line which I found a real nice
[SPEAKER_01]: one I had a black triangle from Bodhi I
had a love triangle also from Bodhi that
[SPEAKER_01]: was actually one of my favorites down
there had like a kind of a cherry play-doh
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of aftertaste smell so yeah out of
those seeds at this legal spot now we've
[SPEAKER_01]: been doing like 50 to 100 at a time and
out of those batches we've been finding
[SPEAKER_01]: some real nice stuff the lemon Royale I
had down there had a real tangy lemon tree
[SPEAKER_01]: but like gas kind of mix going on and it
made good sized plants that was my keeper
[SPEAKER_01]: and I made a bunch of seeds with that one
hit it to the triangle back for us I hit I
[SPEAKER_01]: hit the original TK the original G with
the male I had of it so it's just a little
[SPEAKER_01]: batches from those we've been finding
stuff in we recently went through 60 while
[SPEAKER_01]: G that Josh gave me that were super nice
we ended up keeping like eight and we got
[SPEAKER_01]: narrowed down still to two the Tahiti lime
I crossed to the lemon Royale we found one
[SPEAKER_01]: that was real similar in terms to the
original lemon Royale I had down there so
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah I've been working with those guys
things for the last few years archives
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely amazing myself I like all this
moon bow gear I like all the face-off
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses other than that I've had I have
this plant something gave me here called
[SPEAKER_01]: the platinum TK which was in house seeds
platinum kush I think it was kush mints
[SPEAKER_01]: crossed to a bully kush the guy selected
and said at a very TK like trait bully
[SPEAKER_01]: kush was from C jumpy and that was a
triangle to triangle back cross I think it
[SPEAKER_01]: was BX so yeah just kind of like trying to
stay within that frame but find different
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff trying to like keep it to where it's
TK ROG related for you know for my menu
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah like right now I'm working on a
project out west with some guys they're
[SPEAKER_01]: probably going to be the 92 OG and the
ghost OG and the TK and then they're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be hitting it with some of their stuff
soon so maybe doing some work reversal
[SPEAKER_00]: projects as well hopefully that's cool to
hear and you've got me thinking I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to ask you like as a company that's
offering like primarily OGs in today's
[SPEAKER_00]: market do you find there is still the
demand there or do you feel like people
[SPEAKER_01]: want that you know purple gas candy thing
well what we do is we only do like small
[SPEAKER_01]: batches at a time that way they don't sit
around too long on shelves so we do like
[SPEAKER_01]: probably 10 lights for example and that
that will feed 30 plus stores so by the
[SPEAKER_01]: time the next batch comes out that one
sold out and so I have I'm gonna probably
[SPEAKER_01]: have one genetic in all the rooms so I'll
be like 11 different ones going at all
[SPEAKER_01]: times I'm gonna have that's our diesel
couple of G's the TK and I have like a
[SPEAKER_01]: lemon for us the Tahiti line and a couple
other tangy ones I have the cheddar koi
[SPEAKER_01]: which is from my friend in Hawaii and some
seeds and that one's super different too
[SPEAKER_01]: that was like a big island koi cross to
MOB I think was from Chroma Genetics which
[SPEAKER_01]: was like a cheese frost and think what
else was in that one thing there might
[SPEAKER_01]: have been like a Hells Angel OG and cheese
cross to that big island so yeah there's
[SPEAKER_01]: some different stuff and then we have
we're working on like I said getting some
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of more like sativa leaning thing on
that menu as well soon so yeah trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: mix it up as far as the OG and the TK at
first the first couple batches that went
[SPEAKER_01]: out the market wasn't really ready for yet
and it kind of sat for like a month month
[SPEAKER_01]: and a half even and when they first went
out we had we had some packaging issues
[SPEAKER_01]: where the packaging room humidity sensors
were off and like some of the stuff was
[SPEAKER_01]: going out good some of it was going out a
little bit moist so we had to correct all
[SPEAKER_01]: those issues and basically almost had to
be like a relaunch to get it out there
[SPEAKER_01]: again and once we fixed that things have
been really good and things have been
[SPEAKER_01]: selling out every time and everyone's been
really happy with everything and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people here in Florida like our markets
ten years behind the West Coast you know
[SPEAKER_01]: because just because the way things have
always been so people here are as educated
[SPEAKER_01]: and the majority of people here that are
in the market have a med card which the
[SPEAKER_01]: market here is completely monopolized and
like it's all you know it's in favor of
[SPEAKER_01]: these big companies and until that changes
we can't have any homegrown there's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually trying to go recreational next
year sponsored by one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: companies here now but they haven't had
homegrown added yet which no one's really
[SPEAKER_01]: happy about we'll see what happens with
that but yeah I think when the when the
[SPEAKER_01]: market kind of like comes to gets a little
bit closer to recreational and people's
[SPEAKER_01]: you know like right now you have to go to
a doctor and twice a year and it's cost
[SPEAKER_01]: like 150 or 200 hours a year I think it is
to keep your med card going and then
[SPEAKER_01]: there's the whole thing with the guns here
where a lot of people are just don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to have a med card because they can't have
a legal gun so yeah a lot of things got
[SPEAKER_01]: changed first before out here like
basically people are just not educated
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said this like in California so
they're slowly getting there you know
[SPEAKER_01]: we're catching up fast but at the same
time we're still way behind so it'd be
[SPEAKER_01]: nice to see if you're on recreational then
obviously it's gonna open up for everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: more and hopefully they're gonna get out
more licenses and maybe we'll even let
[SPEAKER_01]: people have smaller mom and pop businesses
eventually but as of right now it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: these huge juggernaut companies that are
running things and I don't know if there's
[SPEAKER_01]: the governor here just politics in general
and big pharma whatever is really behind
[SPEAKER_01]: it the most but it's stayed that way since
we've been back here and we were hoping it
[SPEAKER_01]: would change by now a little more but it
still has yeah certainly I think we can
[SPEAKER_00]: only hope you know cannabis laws worldwide
relax for for everyone's benefit I can
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate your frustration with that for
sure I've got a I've got a bit of a left
[SPEAKER_00]: of field one for you but I wanted to ask
you because I think you might have an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting answer what do you think the
genetics might be of TK and OG if you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't know yourself about you know the
emerald triangle and the Hindu Kush and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe maybe a better way to phrase it is
what would you pitch as an alternative
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic combination that could make the TK
or the OG I would definitely jump into the
[SPEAKER_01]: category of northern lights along those
line because you know like I said the plan
[SPEAKER_01]: that my triangle came from out there that
all the lights came from and then also the
[SPEAKER_01]: last several years has been a lot of
information come out from Neville other
[SPEAKER_01]: people talking about the modern day push
lines are very much like the nl2 and then
[SPEAKER_01]: on top of that like going back to the late
90s again Miami mango used to get this cut
[SPEAKER_01]: of the northern lights too I don't know if
it was from somebody who brought back
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds from Amsterdam or if it was an
actual cut brought from out west somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: or what but it was some of the definitely
some of the best northern lights I've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: seen and he just called it nl2 but it
definitely had a very popcorn kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: TK structure to it and left a really like
nice aftertaste after you smoke it and
[SPEAKER_01]: like kind of linger on your palate for a
while I think and it was one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorites for personal and I think I never
grew it but mango would get pounded over
[SPEAKER_01]: here and there and he would always call me
up and I'd come and grab it out once in a
[SPEAKER_01]: while we didn't hang out a whole lot back
then but we you know we communicated
[SPEAKER_01]: through mutual friends and like like I
said there was definitely a handful of
[SPEAKER_01]: times I grabbed that off him that was one
of my favorites that was coming around and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know it definitely had shape that I
remember of like these big chunky acorn
[SPEAKER_01]: popcorn nuggets you know love and work
dance maybe some of the stuff going around
[SPEAKER_01]: by then so that was good good call it was
probably nl for sure involved whether it
[SPEAKER_01]: was what numbers or whatever you know like
I said neville even claims that all the
[SPEAKER_01]: modern day pushes were basically from his
nl alliance or that he was breeding with
[SPEAKER_00]: out there at the time yeah yeah that's it
that's a good answer I can understand
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're coming from there so I got
one last one before we do the final five
[SPEAKER_00]: questions and I want to know what sort of
plants in general do you think cross well
[SPEAKER_01]: with tk and og well me personally I
haven't had a whole lot of experience
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding you know most of the stuff that
I've come across has been accidental those
[SPEAKER_01]: little projects I did on lockdown are
pretty much my only experience of breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: I've learned a few tips and tricks here
and there from you know actually from like
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt Wright when we first met was talking
about reversals and teaching me stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: about that a few other people along the
way here and there give me some tricks and
[SPEAKER_01]: and some tips but I haven't really had a
whole lot of like hands-on experience
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding yet I'm looking forward to it and
I have all kinds of things in my mind I
[SPEAKER_01]: like to do things but just haven't had the
space really to do it yet and this legal
[SPEAKER_01]: spot we're at we've had conversations
about setting up a room just for strictly
[SPEAKER_01]: for breeding but it just hasn't come to
fruition yet hopefully that happens soon
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah hopefully that happens all right well
let's get into the final five so the first
[SPEAKER_00]: one is what's the single most memorable or
impactful cannabis experience you've had
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have to be the most potent weed
but just what's left the greatest
[SPEAKER_01]: impression well it would probably have to
be some of those first ones like like the
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff we were just talking about the
kryptonite I would imagine that were just
[SPEAKER_01]: something magic about that stuff that you
know it was it was the best of the best
[SPEAKER_01]: that we've seen back at that time so
that's definitely comes to mind that
[SPEAKER_01]: Hawaiian skunk I was talking about earlier
that we would pitch in on as kids that was
[SPEAKER_01]: one of them I really enjoyed having the
juicy fruit for years which is what this
[SPEAKER_01]: columbian and Panama kind of reminds me of
like I said that was another good one
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously the triangle when we first
started growing that it wasn't really for
[SPEAKER_01]: for selling it was more or less for
growing for ourselves but it was making
[SPEAKER_01]: these skinny little plants at first until
we figured you had to top it and get it
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty big before you turned it so that
was kind of like an aha moment when we
[SPEAKER_01]: figured that out and started like being
able to put pounds out of that for people
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah obviously like when I learned all
this stuff related to the OG push in my
[SPEAKER_01]: story that was an aha moment too
definitely and it's still still still
[SPEAKER_00]: going yeah that's a good answer I like
that I like that so on the other end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the spectrum what's a strain where
everyone you knew was hyping it up you
[SPEAKER_00]: were getting really excited to try it you
finally try it and you're a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: disappointed um well there's a lot I still
haven't seen that I'd like to see like
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never actually grown the chems yet
I've had flower form of almost all of them
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had the 91 and yeah I did kind of
have resembled some gassy notes to it for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure my friend in Hawaii sent me some
small amounts then I also had somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: send me some Chem D which I was expecting
to be like the all-time best ever I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know if it was a real cut or not but to me
it just didn't didn't remind me of any
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of OG or TK like everybody was saying
it did um it was you know more on that
[SPEAKER_01]: funky almost like GMO-ish bad breath kind
of funk and onions and mushrooms smell I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember so I wasn't a huge fan of that it
looked really nice but I was expecting it
[SPEAKER_01]: to be just way different as far as I mean
it was definitely stony I remember um I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know like I said whether if it was
the original cut or not I heard it was
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple cuts out there just like TK and
all of them basically that imposter is
[SPEAKER_00]: going around yeah certainly I could
appreciate that for sure so next situation
[SPEAKER_00]: right I'm going to drop you off on a
desert island and you only get to take
[SPEAKER_00]: three strains with you for the rest of
time it can be a clone or it could be like
[SPEAKER_00]: a pack of seeds what three things are you
going to take well just based on this old
[SPEAKER_01]: memory I've had recently of the juicy
fruit that one comes to mind definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: the TK and probably one of the sour
diesels maybe even like the east coast
[SPEAKER_01]: sour diesel that I had now I know like
since then there's there's all this
[SPEAKER_01]: information about different cuts of the
east coast our diesel I don't know which
[SPEAKER_01]: one I had honestly we got my friend of
ours here in Florida traded a TK cut for
[SPEAKER_01]: it and that was around 2003 or four and
that was one of my favorites for sure no
[SPEAKER_01]: wait let me take all this back definitely
the TK the juicy fruit and that hash plant
[SPEAKER_01]: number four that I had back in the day
that would be the top choice right there
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful stuff beautiful stuff okay so on
to the final one I've got a time machine
[SPEAKER_00]: for you oh no no sorry sorry I've skipped
I've skipped ahead I've got too excited
[SPEAKER_00]: let's go back all right so in this one
you've lost your entire genetic library
[SPEAKER_00]: right you got nothing all you can do is
have one pack of seeds can be something
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got now or just you know something
that is available what would you restart
[SPEAKER_01]: your genetic collection with just one pack
of seeds oh that's a tough one hmm one
[SPEAKER_01]: pack of seeds well it's not gonna be a
pure anything obviously if I can get a
[SPEAKER_01]: hold of some of those super scum hash
plant seeds again that we had in our
[SPEAKER_01]: collection that would be the all-time
greatest because like I said if you pop
[SPEAKER_01]: ten of those seeds back in the day you're
gonna get eight they're almost worthy of
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping definitely five for sure that were
like holy shit and they all had like
[SPEAKER_01]: different like variations and smells and
whatever but they're all extremely stinky
[SPEAKER_01]: so yeah I'd have to go with that super
scum hash plant I think we may have some
[SPEAKER_00]: overlap then so now on to our real final
question which is that I've got a time
[SPEAKER_00]: machine for you you can go back to any
place any period presumably to get some
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds or a clone where you gonna go what
are you gonna get Wow beautiful I love it
[SPEAKER_00]: dedicated it must hold a true spot in your
heart so I think with that we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: about at the end of it did you have any
comments or shout outs you wanted to make
[SPEAKER_01]: shout out to Craig a good friend of mine
like he's part of the story we've grown up
[SPEAKER_01]: together we've traveled around the world

[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram if anyone doesn't know that
already shout out to Josh dusty and Kenji
[SPEAKER_01]: and that crew out there and they're super

[SPEAKER_01]: hanging out with them and then the crew

age and he's actually military so he's
[SPEAKER_01]: super like by the book and strict about
everything we talked to each other all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time about what's going on to grow so
shout out to all those guys for sure shout

same time so we've been looking forward to
[SPEAKER_01]: doing that for a while yeah that's what
