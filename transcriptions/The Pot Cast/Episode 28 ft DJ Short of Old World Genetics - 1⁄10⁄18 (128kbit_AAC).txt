[SPEAKER_02]: On this episode, we're joined by one of
the biggest names for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been gunning this one down forever,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prepare for three hours of some serious
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty, so big thank you and welcome to
a man who needs little introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blue strain himself, DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first question we've been starting the
show off with recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: What have you been smoking on recently?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some R&D things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their labels to me are FX1, FX3,
FX4.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a new variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: A tentatively named Happy Pussy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that's actually its name.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the offspring of that,
which I think I'll be calling New Dawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I'm calling it, it's called
Happy Pussy, The Mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is because it makes you purr.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a feline reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that there are other
connotations to the term and it's a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: controversial and I just decided to go
forward with it anyhow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The release, the first release will have a
different name but in the lineage will be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the mother is Happy Pussy and
the father is the F4 blueberry dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she'll get introduced that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's her story.
[SPEAKER_01]: The label I have in mind is the Cheshire
Cat grinning, Happy Pussy on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you purr underneath and then what
were you thinking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it gets a lot of reactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, P.T.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barnum knew about advertising.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the marketing twist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what's most interesting about all
that is I think your son JD maybe posted a
[SPEAKER_02]: photo of that FX1 not just even an hour or
two ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an interesting one because we've
got a lot of people who are really
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in, you know, your new coming
lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: What made you use that terminology like
the FX1?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that stand for exactly?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just kind of arbitrary or does it
mean something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was from a past labeling,
much of which was experimental and works
[SPEAKER_01]: in progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: F was usually floral.
[SPEAKER_01]: X referred to high resin content and it
just happened to be part of its label.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was more to it than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for simplicity's sake, that's what
these particular plants got labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, the Happy Pussy's label was
1-6.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1-7, there's two more numbers on that,
but 1-7 is the main envelope I keep going
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was their initial labeling and
name as they produce, as I'm able to
[SPEAKER_01]: sample the various things, then they
develop a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for example, the FX1, I'm wanting to
call Newberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this strain a lot too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very anti-anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mother on that one is Blue Heaven or a
new version, same parent stock that the
[SPEAKER_01]: original Blue Heaven came from,
just found another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's wonderful, anti-anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very pleasant, comfortable,
functional smoke, very potent,
[SPEAKER_01]: but clear-headed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain med people that have very serious
debilitations are really liking this
[SPEAKER_01]: strain because it makes them feel more
comfortable in their bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of what I was shooting
for and success so far so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exciting to hear because I think
Blue Heaven and kind of the offspring of
[SPEAKER_02]: that have been some of the most sought
after things from the research I've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we get into that, I'd love for
you to take me back.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going way back, very early 70s,
1971 basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first few times I smoked,
nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of the case for most people
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me six tries before I finally had
my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was with a variety, I remember it
well, it was called Mexican Flower Top.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was basic commercial sativa running
around at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Decent quality, more buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the myths about the great sativa of
your, well not myths, but truth in
[SPEAKER_01]: advertising and just think of the whole
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of it was bunk, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the huge loads of it that came in
100 ton loads, we called it dirt weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the smaller loads that came from
smaller importers, people like the
[SPEAKER_01]: Brotherhood of Eternal Love and other
similar organizations, focused by far more
[SPEAKER_01]: on quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smaller quantities, maybe 10 tons at the
most, whereas the larger sativa loads back
[SPEAKER_01]: in the day were 100 tons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the attention to detail and quality
wasn't always up to par on most of that
[SPEAKER_01]: variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you had your connections
established, it was relatively simple at
[SPEAKER_01]: certain times to find much better quality
over others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that Mexican Flower Top, it was just
very interesting, very visual,
[SPEAKER_01]: quite dissociative, time distorting,
colorful, and most enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I was all of, 14 years old at the
time, but had many revelations,
[SPEAKER_01]: epiphany on that particular day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's kind of the experience all
of us are hoping for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in regards to the boll stock or the
Brotherhood of Eternal Love, it's
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting you mention that because it
seems as though as we've done more and
[SPEAKER_02]: more shows, they keep coming up as a
constant reference and a lot of people say
[SPEAKER_02]: that if they could pick any stock from
throughout history, if they could get
[SPEAKER_02]: their hands on some boll, excuse me,
if they get some hands on some boll stock,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's kind of what they'd be thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever, I think you kind of alluded
that that Mexican stuff came possibly
[SPEAKER_02]: through those links.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever find any seeds or was it not
like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think a lot of people think that
the weed would have had seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And way back, it's kind of hard to
decipher that far back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once, 72, 73, and I was really in,
you know, purchasing herb on a regular
[SPEAKER_01]: basis, establishing my own networks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, you go with what you
appreciate the most and working with some
[SPEAKER_01]: of these groups back in the day,
that was just the overall feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if your appreciation was sensed,
that kind of put your place in the network
[SPEAKER_01]: of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I used to do way back
when was whenever I would get a hold of
[SPEAKER_01]: something that was, in my opinion,
quite superior, I would practice extreme
[SPEAKER_01]: discipline and always hold on to some.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for whatever occasion in the future,
be it a party, at a festival or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: and meet someone else who has something of
equal interest, it was very beneficial to
[SPEAKER_01]: then go, oh, well, hey, I've got some of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that connection right there,
I think, did more to further my place in
[SPEAKER_01]: that food chain than probably anything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then you have a rapport.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when that person, and
particularly if they're a dealer,
[SPEAKER_01]: runs into something of quality,
they want to impress you because you
[SPEAKER_01]: impress them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're on the list then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it worked out well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should mention, too, there's a lot
of talk, the Brotherhood of Eternal Love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they were a group that was more out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were outspoken as to who they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there were many such organizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many were loosely affiliated to one
another.
[SPEAKER_01]: That whole distribution chain,
just like any, is a fascinating subject in
[SPEAKER_01]: and of itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the thing which grabs my
curiosity the most out of all of what you
[SPEAKER_02]: said is, I think a lot of people off the
top of their head would say that in their
[SPEAKER_02]: minds, you climbed that hierarchy,
that food chain, pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of people can think back to
hearing you as a leader figure in the very
[SPEAKER_02]: early days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I guess what I'm interested in is,
in your opinion, how long did it take
[SPEAKER_02]: before you felt like you were starting to
get somewhere in the community and you
[SPEAKER_02]: could start to pull some strings and have
a bit of influence?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, given the political climate here in
the states, I mean, I love to brag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I survived Nixon, Reagan, Bush 1,
Bush 2.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should start an organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a veteran of foreign wars,
VFW.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always thought let's start a veteran
of domestic wars that many of us endured
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was laying low all the way up until the
early 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to Amsterdam for my first time in
93 in an attempt to connect there,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of haphazardly did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't get a ball rolling there until the
mid 90s, late 90s, really, things started
[SPEAKER_01]: to take off for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can say in retrospect that I knew these
days were coming back in the early 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I began my breeding work in earnest about
1978, 79 after moving to Eugene,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon from the Detroit, Michigan area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just blossomed from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, as far as breed work, that would have
been 78, 79, as far as really introducing
[SPEAKER_01]: into the community, not really until the
late 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did an article for High Times,
I think the first reference to the name DJ
[SPEAKER_01]: Short, I think it was 98, 1998,
that article came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I certainly think I've found
some references before that just from
[SPEAKER_02]: people, for example, in the Oregon area
who you'd given clones to because- Oh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's an interesting one I wanted to
talk about because, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're probably going to end up having to
go back here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But something I really always admired
about you specifically was that there
[SPEAKER_02]: seemed to be, at least from what I could
gather, you were willing to give out,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, some cuts to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more I trace it back, the more I
think that really helped progress the
[SPEAKER_02]: scene in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you give out your early blueberry cuts
knowing that it would be so beneficial and
[SPEAKER_02]: have the effects it has, or was it more of
just like you're just helping people out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, again, it's the family mentality,
the brotherhood, the grateful dead,
[SPEAKER_01]: really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the mantra is share the love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And spread the love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had no problem ever doing that
because by the time I had something in
[SPEAKER_01]: clone form, I already had seed stock that
was, you know, the next level to work on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, it just, it was a benefit to
get those things out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I didn't have to worry about that
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sold a lot of clones, gave away clones,
traded and sold them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sold many from 1978 until 1987.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of those went down to
Northern California too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That early version of blueberry,
incidentally, it was an auto flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it majorly produced and people really
liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its name wasn't blueberry back in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its name back in the 80s, the primary name
was The Kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way that worked is, you know,
all of us in the industry were working on
[SPEAKER_01]: various things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those various things, of course,
you know, to pay the bills, you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell a lot of these things, some being
better than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: You learn from your clientele when they
come back and they go, no, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, man, what you had last week,
The Kind, man, The Kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was easy to dial in from that
point, getting feedback from people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a lot of interesting things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a band in Eugene I used to go
see on a regular basis called The
[SPEAKER_01]: Outtakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lead guy in it, his name is Steve
Eibach.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's still playing today in Eugene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't miss this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every Tuesday at Mulligan's Pub,
if you are in Eugene, Oregon, go see Steve
[SPEAKER_01]: Eibach.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a one man psychedelic jammer.
[SPEAKER_01]: At any rate, I would go to these shows in
the 80s and I'd have these various types
[SPEAKER_01]: of pot with me or bring one at a time,
but try different ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during the break, during the in
between sets, take the band out and get
[SPEAKER_01]: them stoned and then come back and see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second set was always better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I rarely, you know, experimented with
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only did that type of experimentation
with things that I was pretty certain
[SPEAKER_01]: would fit the bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Steve remembers this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known him for almost 40 years now and
he's in his mid 60s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, if you're in Eugene,
Mulligan's Pub, Tuesdays, Steve Eibach,
[SPEAKER_01]: you won't regret it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's on YouTube too, I B A C H.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a treasure, an absolute musical
treasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it was those kinds of things,
seeing how you can influence a party,
[SPEAKER_01]: show up at a party, break something out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The party's kind of dead when you get
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an hour or two later, it's like,
whoa, that did something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But always it's the, you know,
people ask me how do I judge herb or I
[SPEAKER_01]: should say, yeah, how do I judge herb?
[SPEAKER_01]: Primarily by the effect of the finished
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people, I see one of the big
mistakes that I witness contemporary
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders today and growers is they fall in
love with the plant and the structure of
[SPEAKER_01]: it and the smell of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got to wait and see how that
thing performs, how it smokes,
[SPEAKER_01]: how it feels in my body and over a period
of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it takes a bit of time to
determine the burnout factor and those
[SPEAKER_01]: types of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that to me is how I, the primary means
I judge herb is by smoking the finished
[SPEAKER_01]: product and paying attention and taking
notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, amen.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of people who I've spoken to
who say that that's their opinion and they
[SPEAKER_02]: got it straight from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's kind of a bit mind
blowing, but let's just take a step back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you mentioned you started growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I would love to know is when did you
decide to start breeding and how did you
[SPEAKER_02]: acquire the initial stock to do so?
[SPEAKER_01]: From the get go, I mean, I wanted to grow
and breed from the time I was a teenager.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were seeds and everything back
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those major, those big boatloads of the
Colombian bunkweed and various Mexican
[SPEAKER_01]: bunkweeds that were in such mass quantity
for some reason, I don't know if it was
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure, heat, steam, whatever they did
to it, they wouldn't sprout.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either that, we were completely inept,
couldn't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like where we would smoke out by
the patio, you would notice one spring
[SPEAKER_01]: that a plant came up between the cracks in
the patio blocks and you'd get a little
[SPEAKER_01]: spoon and dig it up and put it in a cup
and stick it somewhere and try to get it
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was then from there, a desk lamp,
one of those, just a lamp on the desk,
[SPEAKER_01]: put the little plant in the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I finally, it was in 1977, I have photos
of these plants actually, that were
[SPEAKER_01]: finally getting to sprout as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a story in my book about not being
able to sprout.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was finally some Hawaiian and this
little toy that came within a cereal box
[SPEAKER_01]: that was a seed sprouter, a little plastic
dome with a piece of sponge in the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wet that thing and put a whole bud
in there and a whole bunch of roots shot
[SPEAKER_01]: out and it's, oh, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Planted a bunch of those, put them under
the desk lamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I finally got a four foot set of
fluorescent lights, hung them at the foot
[SPEAKER_01]: of my bed and mind you, in this day,
there wasn't any place you could go and
[SPEAKER_01]: buy pots and dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't exist back in the day and I had
to modify waste baskets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got metal waste baskets used in old pots
and a pop can opener along the bottom to
[SPEAKER_01]: do drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got gravel out of my driveway for the
drainage in the bottom and dirt from the
[SPEAKER_01]: backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how that went.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put these plants under these lights,
no timing on it, had no idea what
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering cycle was.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grew six feet tall, lanky sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't until that I moved to Oregon
and it was in that interim that I had
[SPEAKER_01]: learned, read Mel Frank's books and Ed
Rosenthal and a few others of the time and
[SPEAKER_01]: had it figured out, oh, dark cycle,
light cycle, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had a little duplex I lived at in Eugene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set up a bathroom and a bedroom,
fluorescent lights again.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was before metal highlights and just
went nutty.
[SPEAKER_01]: By then, there were places in Eugene to
get soil, but it was bulk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like from Rexius.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd have to line the trunk of my old
Chevy with plastic and go down to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Rexius place and they would load it in
with a front loader in the back of my car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shortly thereafter though, I mean,
it started picking up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 78, the highlights, metal
highlights, HID lighting showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: 79, they were really commercially
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was soils and fertilizers
and pots and those various things that
[SPEAKER_01]: agribusiness already had, which then got
distributed to our community and things
[SPEAKER_01]: started taking off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very successful for a lot of people
throughout the 80s due to the political
[SPEAKER_01]: climate was so oppressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The risk was very great.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got caught, but it was relatively
simple to circumvent those problems and be
[SPEAKER_01]: successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luck had something to do with it,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so it was about 80, 81 things
really went boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: High Times was advertising the various
grow systems and things and the Indica
[SPEAKER_01]: genes had shown up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of the questions that was sent
in a few times by the guests was they were
[SPEAKER_02]: wondering if you could give us a little
information on how you initially came by
[SPEAKER_02]: the Oregon Purple Tire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was growing out the Sativa,
doing selections from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had my hands in a number of projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was helping various people set up their
grows, doing some outdoor things in the
[SPEAKER_01]: woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: But had a nice selection to witness,
made my selections, one of which was the
[SPEAKER_01]: Highland Tie, which was the Juicy Fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other two were the Chocolate Tie and
the Oaxacan, both of which I liked a lot,
[SPEAKER_01]: even when I was growing in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not talking even about the land-raised
stock that it came from, but the grown out
[SPEAKER_01]: stock in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Oaxacan was well-behaved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a very symmetric plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't misbehave too terribly in terms
of hermaphroditism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Chocolate Tie on the other was the
exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a different meristem every
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: She grew all over the place, terribly
hermaphroditic.
[SPEAKER_01]: In clusters, though, that were somewhat
easy to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just so happened that I had a whole
bunch of Oaxacan pollen, had done an
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor harvest on that while the outdoor
was flowering, and applied that to this
[SPEAKER_01]: Chocolate Tie plant, which then became the
Oregon Purple Tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was 1979 that that was done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 1980.
[SPEAKER_01]: That the Oregon Purple Tie was first grown
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of clones of that went out as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working with the Indica at that time,
too, is when that showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's the Purple Tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I grew her out, most of the phenotype
from her were workable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They passed the muster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a good clone stock of her going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a picture of her as well,
but only in vegetative state, outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, there's not many photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't digital photography back in
that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my photos are from Polaroids that
a friend of mine would have a Polaroid and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have enough money to buy a pack of
film and have them come over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And still have that evidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, those Polaroids are seriously some
of the most cool little strain history
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff we can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something I did want to ask you kind of
answer is I've seen a few people,
[SPEAKER_02]: very limited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Snow High is the one who comes to
mind and he breeds with the Oregon Purple
[SPEAKER_02]: Tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I wanted to ask, is it still out
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of answered that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name got its place, has its hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: It remains to be seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can say this, I can attest to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a while ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: My goodness, almost 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at Hempfest in Seattle and someone
had showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hanging out at the Cannabis Culture
booth and someone had stopped by.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, oh, I'm from Oregon and I have
what I think is your original blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing that we called The Kind back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had dropped some names in some
places and made me go, huh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he gave a description and I go,
yeah, you know, that really sounds like
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, oh, well.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, I have some.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't bring it with me today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Hempfest was two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came the next day and he had some and
sure enough, that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got his contact info.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was in Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was in Portland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never reconnected with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we shared emails a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it's passing away, I know this is
the case though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there are people out there
that still have these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially people that kept it quiet and
were really low key.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the same can be said for the
land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: For places like Oaxaca and Thailand and
Burma and India, Nepal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That there are still, I like to think in
my mind of a grandmother.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's got her garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's growing not just vegetables but
she's got her herb in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And her goal growing her herb is not
really for money.
[SPEAKER_01]: She might trade some of it for something
or sell a little bit of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But her primary goal is to grow what her
grandmother grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way that went since antiquity is,
you know, you spread your seed in the
[SPEAKER_01]: garden and the plants come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then come fall, you harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And out of one, one of those plants is
your favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that plant that was the favorite,
that's the seeds you use for next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after thousands of years, I mean,
you know, people in these antiquity areas,
[SPEAKER_01]: these land race areas have thousands of
years on us in terms of experience with
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we still have a lot to learn from
them as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And getting, they're still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the Arian method of strengthening the
strain hunters.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Arian's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an upfront guy and I'm okay with what
he does.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're not gonna get to the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna get to the quantity through
the strain hunters method.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want the quality, you've got to
learn the language, learn the culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: devote some time of your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to that area, gain the trust of those
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the brotherhood said, spread the
love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which in the case of the people there is
money or the things that they need in that
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And establish your contacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they're still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they're still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of inspiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to loop back onto something you
mentioned a while ago, something I really
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy about your mindset is a lot of
breeders these days will look at a
[SPEAKER_02]: project, especially after they've grown
out the testers and they'll say it's
[SPEAKER_02]: either good or bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just when you referenced the purple
tie, you said it's workable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it made me realize you see things in
more of like shades of gray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Than black and white.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like that's something that's
missing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where people are just gonna go it's good
or it's bad?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or should people look to work things a bit
more in the way you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, you know, we could use some
improvement in that capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, bearing in mind to go and it's hard
to do because we fall in love with the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a garden going.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got 20 different varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some are just, they stand out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's as a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whatever relationship you have as a
grower with that plant, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: How that carries over into the commercial
world and how other people are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate that plant I don't think can be
fully ascertained until we at least
[SPEAKER_01]: subjectively test that herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I do have five objective criterion
that I'll mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make notes of and I can go over them
real quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's onset.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long does it take to fully feel the
effect of the product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a quick onset or a long onset?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it take an hour?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it take five minutes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Duration.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long does the effect last?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sealing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I continue to smoke more and more,
does my experience expand more?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do I just get stuck in this one,
you know, heavy hitting indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just sink more into the couch.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fourth one, and this is an important
one, and this takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it tolerance threshold or burnout.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, after a week of smoking this
continually, is this something I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: return to?
[SPEAKER_01]: And does it still have the same effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, this is another time
issue, is shelf life.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it sits in a jar for a year,
for two years, or for three years,
[SPEAKER_01]: does it improve in quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: So with those five objective analyses,
the sixth one being, and this is just an
[SPEAKER_01]: overall, would be potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the general potency of, but for me
it's more desirability, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of people are,
if it messes you up a whole bunch,
[SPEAKER_01]: they feel that's a success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas for me, I'm more into a clarity,
clear, and that's harder to dial in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Messing yourself up on something super
potent, that's easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of a common reference we've had in
the show is how some of the strains from
[SPEAKER_02]: years gone by seem to lack kind of what
you referred to as like a ceiling,
[SPEAKER_02]: whereby, you know, you can smoke more and
the experience gets greater.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of go to a new place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Commonly, it's said that a lot of our
modern hybrids don't have this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do have a ceiling and you're kind of
very limited in the feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you think this comes from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've been thinking about it a lot
and it's like, do you think that it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: something about being a lamb?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or being more closer to that end of the
spectrum, it allows you to have a more
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's just, yeah, I'm trying to
figure out where does this ceiling come
[SPEAKER_02]: from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely related to a land race
phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've released, my seed stock is
pretty much F5s.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's five generations from the land
race, which are the P1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have our F1s, F2s, so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did that for a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to establish enough of the
characteristics to, you know, market it as
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it's called, blueberry flow,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also to leave enough of that land race
variance in there so that people have a
[SPEAKER_01]: few generations left to play with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did an article, you know, Shaughnessy's
not long ago and it was calling for a new
[SPEAKER_01]: classification of cannabis, where we have
indica and cetacean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lativa and ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're gonna use those criterion,
I said, why not let's use cannabis indoor?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the indoor environment, which is
primarily high intensity discharge lights,
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively limited soil space,
although that's, you know, growing more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plants tend to acclimate to that
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They acclimate to whatever environment
they are in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that indoor environment, I think,
you know, we can't replicate the tropical
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are too many variables or too many
variables just going on in that
[SPEAKER_01]: environment that we're limiting in that
indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my opinion, it's about the eighth
generation out, 10th for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the 10th generation, you are seeing
this very likeness between strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed this for the first time when I
was in Europe back in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in Europe in the 90s, pretty much all
they had were sodium lights, high
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity sodium lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have many metal highlights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was more the orange spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was there that I noted because I
use mainly highlights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like that blue spectrum a lot
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allowed me to differentiate that
the sodiums were bringing out the sour and
[SPEAKER_01]: the highlights were bringing out the
sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed to me, and I experimented
several times to my satisfaction that,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, that's pretty much the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I'm really liking these ceramic
metal highlights, the 315 and the 630s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the blue end, 4,000, 4,200 Kelvin
in that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really in the bud room, especially the
last few weeks, they bring out the sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting because I've always
used metal halides based on the
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendation of a few kind of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always noticed that, yeah,
my harvests do tend to be quite sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can attest to that one myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something we got a few questions from the
fans for was they were interested in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghani that you used to cross to the
purple tie to create the initial flow
[SPEAKER_02]: line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think a lot of people maybe
assumed that it was like a very pure
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghani and maybe very desirable.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were your recollections of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it showed up, it came to me late
1979.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I started growing it until
early 1980 in bag seed form.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was grown in Northern California,
so just one generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they kept it strictly indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a connection with the dealer and the
manicurist who again, we were sharing
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics so they didn't have a problem
with me getting seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were trying to keep those off the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Point being is I had a small number of
these seeds, about 50 of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I was able to procure a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first and foremost, they were unlike
anything we had at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were stout, very symmetric,
very uniform, looked like little Christmas
[SPEAKER_01]: trees, very large leaves, green.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't go purple at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thick stems and they smelled like a dead
skunk under the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very musky odor, large bulbous calyx,
or not calyx, I'm sorry, trichome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really where we started to see
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativa don't have a lot of glandular stalk
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativa do have more systolic hairs that
secrete oils directly onto the surface of
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not in a sheath like our trichome
is in a sheath and that's the indica
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I then was fortunate enough to have indica
pollen that I took both to the purple tie
[SPEAKER_01]: that I had going at the time and the
Highland Oaxacanore Juicy Fruit Tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the cross both ways because I had
female indicas as well, but I wasn't as
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in that line, the sativa pollen
to the indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was much more interested in the indica
pollen to the sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that indica was very unique,
but it was also god-offly boring.
[SPEAKER_01]: We fell in love with it initially because
it was novel and unique and it made
[SPEAKER_01]: manicuring easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and it was done in eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was dealing with sativas that never
finish sometimes, 18, 20, 22 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativa and manicuring was just a
nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had no bag appeal, whereas the indica
was something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It put you on the couch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very sedate, which was unlike the
things of the times.
[SPEAKER_01]: That novelty was its hype and it became
very popular and in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: overly popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an article in High Times,
I think it was the 83, maybe 82,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cover of the magazine is a picture of
an indica bud, a great big indica finished
[SPEAKER_01]: bud, black background with a large red
circle slash over the bud and the words,
[SPEAKER_01]: ban the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was written by an author, went by the
name of R.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always thought it was Robert Clark,
but I asked him about it and he denies
[SPEAKER_01]: that it was him.
[SPEAKER_01]: At any rate, the article went on to say
that these indica genetics were polluting
[SPEAKER_01]: the gene pools in the land-raised sativa
areas because those people then,
[SPEAKER_01]: the farmers in those regions thought
that's what we wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: To this day, you're seeing ramifications
of that in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see pictures of those squat
little indica bushes on the mountain sides
[SPEAKER_01]: in Jamaica, to me, that's just sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaica was making 18-foot wispy willow
wonderful sativa, still can and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_01]: they still do, but it's what the market
bears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was the indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have seeds of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Replicating it, I think could be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just ask myself why and I look at the
list of things I have to do and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, things I'd rather do than resurrect
the indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it's still in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: With all the soldiers going back and
forth, the States here, I hear rumor of a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of Kandahar and various things that
are supposed to be around, but I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: personally smelled that dead skunk under
the house indica yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's interesting because you
referenced it perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Kandahar is around and we've been
talking a lot on the show about how the
[SPEAKER_02]: roadkill skunk, as people refer to it,
is most likely actually an Afghan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many are not really a skunk, but what I'm
really interested in about that is when
[SPEAKER_02]: you first created the flow line,
did you pop some of those seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately or did they sit on the shelf
for a minute and you had some other things
[SPEAKER_02]: to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, they sat on the shelf for a
minute and had many other things to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, politically, it was a wretched era.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just surviving those days was an effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I glomped along place to place,
one of the terrible things in the 80s for
[SPEAKER_01]: me was I would get my act together,
have a place, find a rental, establish my
[SPEAKER_01]: grow, get it going, get some R&D going,
get some nice revenue generation
[SPEAKER_01]: potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going and then you get an eviction notice.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was just ongoing and ongoing and
ongoing and it was terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was manipulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of witnessed this firsthand.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, the whole housing bubble on
the West Coast was primarily fueled by pot
[SPEAKER_01]: growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw this firsthand.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I moved in 78, it was a breeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were rentals everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: The place was just in economic shambles in
that capacity, but it was very easy to
[SPEAKER_01]: rent anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think real estate industry realized who
we were and capitalized on us in that it
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't too difficult to figure out who's
growing what where.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just kind of go by the property and
can figure that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it starts with inspections.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we need to do an inspection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, during Reagan and Bush one,
these were very trying times.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did not mess with any of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the house goes up for sale and of
course you can't qualify to buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you are out on the rental market
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rentals are drying up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's none.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going down to very few and I'm
showing up to this one where there's an
[SPEAKER_01]: appointment and there's 200 people there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a specific time on a weekend to
show up and here's 200 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 of us are growers and I recognize us
all in the crowd and we're vying for the
[SPEAKER_01]: house.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of us will get it because we always
pay on time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always pay in cash and starting in
those days, we paid 15 to 25% more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That inflates the value of the property.
[SPEAKER_01]: That justifies mortgage rates and
mortgages and that's just how that whole
[SPEAKER_01]: thing went.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, I got out of the Eugene area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Went out to drier climbs the east side of
the state where things were a lot cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's still the case today.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's certain places, eastern
California, eastern Oregon, eastern
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington, Nevada and who knows what's
going to be opening up next.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Idaho would be nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Utah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stranger things have happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: At what point did you feel a bit more
comfortable in Oregon?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it was after those turbulent years
with Nixon and Bush one and whatnot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clinton got in things, things back down a
little.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was traveling a lot and it was just very
apparent and very obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would take a trip five, six hours on the
freeway and you would see five or six cars
[SPEAKER_01]: pulled over on the side of the road,
everyone out of the car, all the contents
[SPEAKER_01]: out, police digging through.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was just constant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That finally abated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It backed off about 92.
[SPEAKER_01]: 91, 92, in my opinion, were the worst
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were the driest years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody had difficulties surviving that
era.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the whole country was ready for a
change, which is why things happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things lightened up.
[SPEAKER_01]: California began to lighten up,
the whole medical scene there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 96, I think, Prop 215.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 94 that Dennis Perrone was making
waves and people were talking about it
[SPEAKER_01]: anyhow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were coming out of the closet at that
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I did feel more comfortable then,
especially after going to Europe and
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe was miles ahead of us at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So was Canada for a brief spell there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took advantage of both those places as
much as I could.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we jump into that, because we do
have a few questions, I just wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: loop back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned you made those flow seeds
initially when you crossed the Afghani to
[SPEAKER_02]: the Purple Tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that the point when you could sense
that the blueberry line was locked in it
[SPEAKER_02]: or was it still further yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, still further yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Purple Tie, the Juicy Fruit Tie,
and those Afghan, those would be
[SPEAKER_01]: considered the P1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seeds from those ties and Oaxacan,
those are the F1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those seeds were uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all looked alike.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I've seen in pictures,
I always related them to Lebanese plants
[SPEAKER_01]: because Lebanese are kind of in between
indica and sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long spear-shaped buds, complete cacophony
of odor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had every smell in the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little color variation, but I think that
may have had something more to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: placement in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was using various colored bulbs at the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might have had something to do
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for honesty's sake here, truth in the
whole advertising story, I did not know
[SPEAKER_01]: what I was doing at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just unfolding and I was
witnessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew out these F1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, they were all quite similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had incredible potency, liked them a
great deal, and then crossed a few of
[SPEAKER_01]: those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was in and around this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was about 1983 that I finally
got a hold of Robert Clark's book,
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana Botany.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might even have been published in 83.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was able to go, oh,
oh, that's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was then, okay, so you have these
F1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take any two of the F1s, male,
female, cross them, grow those seeds out
[SPEAKER_01]: in the F2 line.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the variance shows up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then it's in that F2 line that I start
to see, say for blueberry, it's a berry
[SPEAKER_01]: mother, a berry father.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cross them out to F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should see at least 50% hopefully 25
to 50% of the progeny sporting that
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: You then take the best example,
male, female, of a berry in the F3 out to
[SPEAKER_01]: an F4.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I do then is those F4s,
the seeds I make from them, which are the
[SPEAKER_01]: F5s, are the ones that I sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when I'm playing around, it's when I
started sprouting the F2s was when I went,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was my great epiphany time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would have been early 80s,
80, 81, 82 on, just all the way on from
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every crop I grew from that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I sprouted seeds, I saw
something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an example when I give my class.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know this at the time again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've since researched.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I was witnessing, I think,
is something referred to in biology called
[SPEAKER_01]: transgressive segregation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And transgressive segregation refers to
two very different P1s, very different,
[SPEAKER_01]: crossing them to make F1s of a uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use an example of dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier for us to wrap our head around
dogs and say if you could cross a
[SPEAKER_01]: Chihuahua to a Great Dane, the smallest
dog to the biggest dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the joke goes, hopefully the Great
Dane is the mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then those would represent your P1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your F1s from that crossing would be
something right in between them,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a pit bull, boxer, very uniform in
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any two of those F1 dogs, those
boxered-like dogs that you cross,
[SPEAKER_01]: will then give you puppies that if
transgressive segregation comes into play,
[SPEAKER_01]: you will see examples larger than the
Great Dane and smaller than the Chihuahua.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see things beyond what the original
land race, and that's what I witnessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what I witnessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flo presented herself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I go by the effect of the finished
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I smoked that plant, it was just
like, whoa, hello, you're a day
[SPEAKER_01]: brightener.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really focused, very motivational,
but unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is extremely unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smokes like a sativa, looks like a sativa,
grows like a sativa, but is done in seven
[SPEAKER_01]: and a half weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my opinion, the only real
difference between indica and sativa is
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's gonna ruffle some feathers.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what do you, cause this is
something I've spoken to a few people
[SPEAKER_02]: about, especially Bodhi, because he's got
a lot of experience with land races.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said to me, I've found a Hindu coup
with the exact same terpene profile as a
[SPEAKER_02]: haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I got them tested, they had
similar numbers for THC and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet the highs are obviously totally
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're kind of sitting there going,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got this plant that smells the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: The numbers are about the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only difference is the flowering time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so yeah, what do you think is
ultimately the cause of the perceptual
[SPEAKER_02]: feeling of a sativa versus an indica?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, that's a big, big question,
a big, big subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is something that is so big,
I think we are going to set the tenets of
[SPEAKER_01]: science on its ears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what we're talking about here are
the subtleties of a nonlinear dynamic.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, and I've discussed this with a
number of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we know about THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got your graph.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's your THC, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's your CBD right there and your
other minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: In between and all along are all these
other little things going, we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: find that it's one of these little toots
that it's up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this other little toot is right over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that does this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regardless of what the big ones are doing
up here, it's those little ones and those
[SPEAKER_01]: ratios between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how the complexity to map that is
unfathomable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we got to start somewhere,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I have some ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of which has to do with a cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: We came up with an idea for a cup that
would only utilize one strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: one strain, one clone, particularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could expand it out to be seed
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really to dial this in and to use this
both as a cup and an experiment,
[SPEAKER_01]: one mother clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give the growers a year, two years,
give them two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all come back to this cup and we
analyze then what each and every one of
[SPEAKER_01]: them did, because we've already heard the
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take a mother plant, you can take 12
cuts off of it, give it to 12 different
[SPEAKER_01]: people and get 12 different things back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's analyze the things that come back
and then ask the growers, what did you do
[SPEAKER_01]: different?
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe then we can start parsing out
some of the cause and effect as to what
[SPEAKER_01]: this is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now myself, my goal is to replicate the
experiences I had from those original land
[SPEAKER_01]: races.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the seeds I grew here, but those
products that came from the Brotherhood of
[SPEAKER_01]: Eternal Love and those other groups from
Oaxaca and Thailand and India and Nepal,
[SPEAKER_01]: Kashmir, Afghanistan, Morocco,
Lebanon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't got to that magic yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always hate to burst people's bubbles
when I talk about this, but in where we're
[SPEAKER_01]: at, now, you're in Australia, you said,
it's a little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a better opportunity in
Australia, I think, in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: replicating a sativa environment than we
do here in the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always tell people domestically here
in the States, we will never equal that
[SPEAKER_01]: equatorial sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we're getting very close to
making A-grade hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what we need to be
focusing on in areas like this,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what the Afghans did,
which is what the Moroccans did,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Lebanese did for thousands of
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have a product that when you
smoke it and it's done right by the people
[SPEAKER_01]: of sincere interest there, you will see
the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can only talk about it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to experience it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only talk about it so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these differences, I think,
are very subtle things.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite herb was the Highland Oaxacan,
like I said, and it, I think, tested out
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the day at 7% THC, which all this
stuff was maxing out at.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most potent stuff they tested in the
day was Maui Waui at 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's something else going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's in these subtle ratios of these
various minor elements that we need to
populate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, we got our work cut out for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plenty to do there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a wild open frontier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you really dabble much in the whole
concentrate scene outside of hash or are
[SPEAKER_02]: you primarily just a hash guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you mean by that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like are you into like the BHOs and the
distillates and all that stuff?
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people in Afghanistan and Morocco
were as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use various solvents and pressure
cookers and things for some of their
[SPEAKER_01]: products and they have for a long,
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, anyway, we can make this stuff in a
pure form.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people are uptight about
solvents and various things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is done right if people pay
attention to detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can tell by testing the finished
product whether or not there's anything
[SPEAKER_01]: harmful in there or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: By all means, separate out and let's start
isolating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, the isolation of individual
terpenes is another just fascinating
[SPEAKER_01]: subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: My God.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have here a substance that can
provide so many of these on a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: basis if need be once we're left alone and
can do what we want in that regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to loop back to Flow, one of the
questions that got submitted by a few
[SPEAKER_02]: different guests, and I was a bit
interested in this one myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the exact definitional difference
between Flow and Temple Flow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Temple Flow just your keeper flow?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was just a name I was banding about
at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temple was a reference to Nepalese temple
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Flow mother, the same one that
incidentally is still alive today,
[SPEAKER_01]: she sprouted in 1991, so 27 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was her appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this sativa-looking plant with
finishes of seven and a half weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the resin from her and her overall
appeal, it was in the line of,
[SPEAKER_01]: the best smoke I've ever smoked was
Nepalese temple ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right up there followed closely by
Kashmiri Cheris, followed closely by some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Afghan from the late 70s and early
80s, the Brotherhood Afghan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those herbs meant to be consumed as
hash, I think, as concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very rare occasions for doing flower,
smoking flower, and only sativa flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flower, I think, in that capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainly something to mix with the
concentrate other than tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think it concentrates is what
we're shooting for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the Flow, she just had that appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: She reminded me the most of the temple
ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the name Temple Flow came
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flow also has two connotations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Floral and fluorescent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she possessed both characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fluorescent was a look to the plant,
and kind of in the feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sharp, sharpness that, say,
a fluorescent bulb has, that type of
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And floral, very floral, flowery appeal to
her in her terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all testing, most of my things
test high in betacaryophylline and
[SPEAKER_01]: mercine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have some test results somewhere
from these latest ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some odd things in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still parsing this out myself and
learning about various terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpenes, too, are, when you have a pure
terpene and you mix it with another
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene, depending on the amount,
the ratio between the two terpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can create an entire array of flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adding a little oxygen here, hydrogen
there, just changes things a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they all start with the rose
smell, geraninal, and it's built on from
[SPEAKER_01]: there to make lemons and oranges and
fruits and woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, a fascinating subject,
which I think is a great place for us,
[SPEAKER_01]: for human beings to begin learning about
nonlinear dynamic will be in these
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and the sense of smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sense of smell in the brain just is
another, is a fascinating subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very closely associated with memory,
widely dispersed throughout the central
[SPEAKER_01]: nervous system, and also very highly
associated with cannabinoid.
Receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something I've said to people in the
past is that it's exactly what you just
[SPEAKER_02]: said with the terpenes is that terpenes,
even at different concentrations can have
[SPEAKER_02]: different smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the possible array you can get is
almost exponential.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the question I have is, do you think
it's possible given, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the right genetics being aligned and
whatnot, that cannabis can create any
[SPEAKER_02]: smell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've postulated, I've wondered about this
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think about other species of plant
that have as wide an array cacophony of
[SPEAKER_01]: odor as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only other family I can think of
is mint.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a wide variety in mint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would think that through selective
breeding, and just in my own experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, my God, and hazes, you know,
these, and I have so many hazes that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: had to put on the shelf because their
commercial potential is low, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: through the eras we've been through.
[SPEAKER_01]: We needed the bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have them labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every flavor of haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every imaginable flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's boggled my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a smell, I think I referred to
it either in my book or in an article
[SPEAKER_01]: since then, I called it ethnic holiday.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was ethnic holiday and then there
was funeral party.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a funeral parlor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of which, I mean, ethnic holiday for
me, I came from an East European family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I would go to say Christmas,
the smells in that household between the
[SPEAKER_01]: foods and the tobaccos and the colognes
and the alcohols and the Christmas tree
[SPEAKER_01]: and just everything going on, and then the
memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's great because when I start
playing around with these herbs,
[SPEAKER_01]: squeeze a bud and smell it, I remember my
grandma's house.
[SPEAKER_01]: She says, oh, ethnic holiday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yee-haw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Funeral parlor is heavy on the lily and
formaldehyde.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Funeral parlor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some names just are appropriate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So last little step in this whole journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you take us from Flow to Blueberry?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did that little transition happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it wasn't really a transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were parallel, you know, along.
[SPEAKER_01]: They developed side by side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Side by side, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: My notes are wretchedly, I understand
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were a work in progress, you know,
different experiments with different
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially, like when I started seeing
these things in my F2s, I started labeling
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would assign each plant two capital
letters.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the FX came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were W.
[SPEAKER_01]: W was for wide leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: B was for berry or blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had O for orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them were flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others were a structural phenomenon or how
much resin they were putting up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would take the two most prominent
traits, assign those two letters,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that would be the label to that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next generation then would be two
capital letters by two capital letters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever the cross happened to be,
I always got in the habit of doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: female first and the male second just to
have consistency throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, when you go to the
next generation, of course you have two
[SPEAKER_01]: letters by two letters by two letters by
two letters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts getting complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I experimented with a bunch of
these different numeric labeling systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can go back in and kind of identify
certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be put to the test in the not
too distant future when I go back and
[SPEAKER_01]: search for certain things like a cherry
variety or say a very sweet orange or a
[SPEAKER_01]: sweet cedar haze and see if I can actually
go back in the catalog through my notes
[SPEAKER_01]: and find.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty confident I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting them to sprout, growing them out
the whole nine yards, then looking forward
[SPEAKER_01]: to doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the not too distant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everyone's looking forward to you
doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at this point, when you had,
you know, the flow and the blueberry
[SPEAKER_02]: running parallel, you developing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was this the point when you realized you
were really onto something?
[SPEAKER_02]: And did you have to kind of make a choice
between the two in terms of which one you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to put forward more?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or did it just work itself out like that
in the end?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it just worked out like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry, of course, she was the one that
has the most commercial appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of the two, flow was almost a
counterpart to blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, mind you, again, my primary focus is
on satisfying my own head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through those years, through those
years, the combination of smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry and flow to me was the closest I
would get to smoking the highland Oaxaca.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a blending of those two herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just for my own satisfaction,
I kept those plants that I most enjoyed
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking and that just turned out to be
what other people enjoyed as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get asked, how did you come up with the
blueberry?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I always go to this one term.
[SPEAKER_01]: The term is healing, healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry is the one that best helped me
heal to feel right in my body and over
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And flow did the same thing and they both
had equal merit in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be perfectly honest, flow, I think,
had a little bit more merit for me
[SPEAKER_01]: personally, but blueberry had more
commercial potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that saved her place in the veg room,
so to speak, in the mother room to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: her going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's always been that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you have the space for and
whatnot?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's really interesting you mention
that because I've, like many people,
[SPEAKER_02]: grown out a pack of blueberry before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I didn't find my keeper,
but what I did really find was that a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of the feeling of the high very much
encompassed that healing aspect you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really caught me off guard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't expecting that, especially of
plants that finished so early.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was another thing I wanted to
mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you purposely keep that in mind?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've noticed blueberry finishes so
stably early.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really good trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was intentional.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very utilitarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the era, if I do it over again,
it won't be as much as a factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, I'm beginning now
seeing commercial acceptance of auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there are certain subtle
quality traits that may only be present in
[SPEAKER_01]: an auto flower line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, that's our job.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be looking for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just fascinates me to no end that I can
go online and look to other growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: look to other people, see what other
people are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I released blueberry and flow seeds
initially, not so much the flow seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flow seeds came from one mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the blueberry, the blue heaven,
and the blue moonshine, initially those
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds that I'd sent to Europe and that I
had gone to Mark Emery had several mothers
[SPEAKER_01]: and several different male contributors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't from a single line.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was variance in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that intentionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the finished product was going to be
blueberry or blue moonshine, but some
[SPEAKER_01]: leaned more sativa, some leaned more
indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I wanted to see was to utilize the
grow reports from the community before it
[SPEAKER_01]: was in 1998 then that I decided on a
stretch indica female and that F4
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was by, again, the number of
responses that people were posting online
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of, oh, this is what I prefer,
had my best luck here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was a lot of variance in those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that might have something to do
with this phenomenon when you hear pre-98.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pre-98 this, pre-98 that is I released a
wide variance of genetics up to 98.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then beginning in 98, it was one
mother, one father, and since that time,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been one mother and one father of
blueberry for my stables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now as far as what other people,
Dutch Passch and Sager Mother,
[SPEAKER_01]: whomever is doing with blueberry,
I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not involved with those at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's anybody's guess there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many avenues in which we could jump
into from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try to not miss them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the first one.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I've noticed is some of these lines
you referenced, you know, the blue
[SPEAKER_02]: moonshine, blue Haven, these more variant
lines, some of them to me seems like they
[SPEAKER_02]: have amassed the biggest cult following of
them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you ever notice that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you ever kind of get pressured to
bow into it and maybe re-release them
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself, or it's just not on your
horizon, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have another version of blue
moonshine right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have this blue Haven going.
[SPEAKER_01]: She completely satisfies that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to smoke the offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't tested her fully yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seed might qualify to be called blue
Haven if it smokes, you know, the bud from
[SPEAKER_01]: that seed smokes such.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been able to test it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like the name Newberry, so I might
just go that route.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, space and time, and as it
presents itself and as we're able to lock
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these in, yes, by all means.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have copies of everything,
absolutely everything I've ever released
[SPEAKER_01]: in the parent stock, in the parent stock
to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll be back to the P1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been holding off specifically for a
number of reasons, the main one being that
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry in my opinion right now is
just far too unstable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The moneyed interests are playing their
hand right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That adds a lot of confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: The price, just the price of herb,
what it ends up being, these things run
[SPEAKER_01]: through all sorts of cycles and phases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of sitting that out until,
in essence, what will happen in the future
[SPEAKER_01]: is a lot of these growth spaces and all
our equipment are going to become
[SPEAKER_01]: available from some of these companies
that go bankrupt, pennies on the dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm just waiting for a nice little
space to show itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to do this in the midst of
the legalization frenzy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, when things go up to hundreds of
dollars a square foot for a warehouse
[SPEAKER_01]: space that used to go for pennies a square
foot because people are trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: capitalize on this, it's impossible to
work in that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the legal situation that once I
get established somewhere, how do I
[SPEAKER_01]: protect myself?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I, these things remain to be seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once that happens though, I'm looking
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put out this thing, I just sort of wrote
it not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just shared it among certain few people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had to do with a GoFundMe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was raising a bunch of money to do
a GoFundMe for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: To grow out, I had a bunch of,
I was going to do everything under one of
[SPEAKER_01]: them, all the way back to my P1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I whittled that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, no, just F4s and F5s, everything
I've released.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely everything I have released,
including the parent stock, all the way
[SPEAKER_01]: back and grow it all out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be a few thousand plants and then
do an open pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every male, every female in there just
boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit them all up, make a few million seeds,
sell them for two bucks a piece to the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that invested in the GoFundMe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then give people the opportunity to,
we would have verification.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got these genetics from this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's all my notes going all the way
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can verify these genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we establish sort of like an AKC
for dogs, for pedigree, for establishing
[SPEAKER_01]: standards, for lines, all these types of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also to allow the community access to
all these genetics I have on an equal
[SPEAKER_01]: basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I planned it out, it was like,
you couldn't invest more than 4% of
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever the GoFundMe would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only buy as much seed as you
invested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can either trade in your investment or
keep your investment stable and purchase
[SPEAKER_01]: the seed at two dollars a piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: In doing so, just the production of the
seed would fund the entire operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would take maybe two years,
three at the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to really be thorough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be three years, guaranteed to be
able to make enough seed to satisfy the
[SPEAKER_01]: world market on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then go to one of these failing grow
ops and say, well here, let us lease your
[SPEAKER_01]: space for a couple hundred thousand
dollars a year instead of having to go in
[SPEAKER_01]: and invest millions of dollars buying
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of lining up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just waiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like some of the people who jump
in too early get punished, especially
[SPEAKER_02]: financially.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to clarify, the Blue Heaven line,
that is essentially just like a very
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-anxiety phenotype of the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think that's, that's the one that
which from what I've been able to research
[SPEAKER_02]: has the biggest kind of following and push
for it to come back because I think as you
[SPEAKER_02]: be aware, already people think of
blueberry as a very anti-anxiety line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to have what you would consider to be,
you know, the pinnacle of that,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just kind of the next level,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's subtle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are subtleties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to, the analogy I like to use with
the cannabis industry, where it's at right
[SPEAKER_01]: now is it's like cooking and it's like
chefs and all of our contemporary,
[SPEAKER_01]: the breeders of today are like chefs who
have just discovered the spice rack,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what is the, Oh, put a bunch of
this in and put a bunch of this in and put
[SPEAKER_01]: in, they get all of these, again,
cacophonies of things together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I found in my experience is that
when we then isolate those special flavors
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and again, their ratio to other
flavors is what makes a true delicacy in
[SPEAKER_01]: that analogy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly sometimes less is more as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to loop back on what you mentioned
a minute ago, you said, you're not too
[SPEAKER_02]: sure what Dutch Passion or Saga Martha are
doing with the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did get some inquiry.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was, you know, without going into any
details you don't want to, what was the
[SPEAKER_02]: situation with Dutch Passion?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because obviously they released some of
your lines for awhile and then that kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of split.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's kind of your recount of generally
what happened there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I could say they ripped me off,
but not really because he paid me the
[SPEAKER_01]: minimum amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he could have, I was again,
due to political circumstances,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was under a barrel.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nothing I could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to take whatever I could get.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had just left Saga Martha who didn't
really, I got ripped off by Saga Martha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saga Martha, that I can say very,
very plainly and clearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did get my seed collection back,
took that over to Dutch Passion,
[SPEAKER_01]: had a deal going with them, which should
have gone on in perpetuity forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Hank, being a Dutch businessman,
he is just decided one day that,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, you know, let's not, don't take this
personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only business, but I don't feel I
should have to pay you anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, gave me, we spread it
out, it was kind of a large payment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The deal I had, I don't mind sharing this,
it was I think 30 cents a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was getting a euro on, but he was
producing, what, 100,000 seeds a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from my perspective, that's kind of
what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I set up a few of those in different
places and then I'm all set, but that has
[SPEAKER_01]: to go on for awhile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did visit some lawyers in Amsterdam at
the time and they all just gave me the
[SPEAKER_01]: shrug shoulder and sorry, you're a little
too early for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's nothing we can do for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that Hank has made a
considerable amount of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe 60,000 euros is what I got totally
from the whole deal over the course of
[SPEAKER_01]: what, seven, eight years.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not even that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the main thing I wanted when I left,
what was important to me, see,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hank was registering the names of
Blueberry with the Benelux Market Bureau.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where he needed my help,
proving this was my intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have all of this paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have every letter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if push ever comes to shove,
I mean, I've got all this evidence here to
[SPEAKER_01]: go, but litigation to me is, it's a big
waste of energy, you know, to avoid it as
[SPEAKER_01]: much as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he wanted this because of Sager Model,
at the time when he was registering
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry, you know, the Benelux Market
Bureau solicits anyone that's using that
[SPEAKER_01]: trademark and says, oh, is this okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony's lawyer said, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hank wrote to me, he says, hey,
send me all the information you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: proving this is your intellectual
property.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a stack of papers, I don't know,
almost an inch thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hank gets that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few months later, I get an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: My attorney says with the information you
said that this is proof positive and we
[SPEAKER_01]: have $909.
[SPEAKER_01]: $909 to one chance of winning the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: That information got submitted to Tony's
lawyer at Sager Model, who then quit on
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony because I think it was apparent in
that paperwork that, no, buddy,
[SPEAKER_01]: this isn't yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I then left Dutch Passion,
my primary concern was, well, Hank will
[SPEAKER_01]: getting my seed collection back,
which I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And number two, to have the rights to
those names in the European market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have that in writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I got the important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, the losses are nowhere near as
important as staying focused on what's in
[SPEAKER_01]: the future because that's by far more
valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I guess the one kind of question I
have remaining on that topic is a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people will commonly say that over the
years, it's common for Dutch companies to
[SPEAKER_02]: lose parents and to not even say anything
and to still offer seeds and quality
[SPEAKER_02]: deteriorates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that a similar thing may have
occurred with the stuff they're offering,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in the blueberry lines and
whatnot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm almost positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have firsthand knowledge,
but I did hear from a number of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've connected well enough in the
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people that did work for growing
in some of these communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Dutch Passion, I think, was
contracting Soma to grow some of their
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And various other people in that Amsterdam
grow scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, they lose their things all the
time and then just try to replicate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think with mine, they probably just
bought a pack of seeds and took it from
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't have firsthand knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just as a little change of scenery,
I wanted to ask you, do you really keep
[SPEAKER_02]: track on any of the strains that are made
with blueberry that start to gain a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: traction?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you view that as like just a
positive thing for blueberry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, so I guess the two poster childs
would be Blue Dream for one, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you kind of address that
with your version of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other one for me, a personal note,
my favorite strain is the Blue Magoo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if you really know much
about that, but there's actually a bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: a rumor that you made that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's true, but I'd love to
hear, you know, your kind of thoughts on
[SPEAKER_02]: how do you view the strains that,
you know, are kind of half blueberry and
[SPEAKER_02]: really take off?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you follow that at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you know, it's like a car wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go by, you got to kind of look at
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as the Blue Magoo in particular,
I don't know about that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue Dream, it's great hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, that doesn't hurt at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried replicating the Blue Dream with As
Your Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of the same cross,
but so much of this is based on hype,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something new comes along.
[SPEAKER_01]: It catches people's fancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for whatever reason, it has that
marketing aspect to it that people just
[SPEAKER_01]: glom onto.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue Dream, the name, you know,
in the name game is so prevalent in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd hope that we would be able to progress
beyond that, keep it as sort of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a fun little entertainment
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think that's a lot of what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I did not, if I did make the Blue
Magoo, it's without my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone else came up to me at a show one
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was selling clones out of a place in San
Francisco, CMH or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even remember the name of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a giant Buddha statue in their
lobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: They ended up closing early.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the nicer scenes too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had onsite consumption and it was right
there in the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were selling clones in a bunch of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They closed then and that went on their
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd never heard from anyone until one day
I met a show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was at Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a fella comes up and he says,
you know, I worked there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I worked in their clone room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want you to know that they took
that blueberry and they crossed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget what the heck they said they
crossed it with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I forget what he said it made.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was something like Bubba Kush or
Big Kush or one of the big name brand
[SPEAKER_01]: strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, think Grateful Dead, Grateful Dead
family.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it's a minor incidental having this
competition out there compared to the
[SPEAKER_01]: prize that yet awaits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I'm going to focus on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what we're talking about is
intellectual property rights, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, there's a lot of law that's
already established in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, the same thing for me as it is for
tomatoes would be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm concerned as we all should be about
major conglomerates, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: people with a little too much control and
influence trying to take over this.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my biggest concerns moving forward
has been for a while now that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be doing my work in a legal environment
and to someday get a cease and desist
[SPEAKER_01]: order from a major corporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just so your listeners know,
it used to be Monsanto, now it's Bayer,
[SPEAKER_01]: just for reference sake in those regards.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are other corporations doing
this as well, people within the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do I best go about protecting
myself in this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm open to many possibilities,
so we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see where that goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one possible solution to that
problem I've heard is that if people get
[SPEAKER_02]: basically their work within the public
domain, it can restrict the ability for
[SPEAKER_02]: people to patent, copyright those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And specifically, I think we've heard that
Filos is one avenue in which this can
[SPEAKER_02]: happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know much about Filos and would you
consider doing that if it was the case?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met them a while ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when they were getting going,
Mowgli and Nishan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Years ago, this was presented to me at the
Hemfest in Seattle by Mowgli that his
[SPEAKER_01]: intent was to do what he was calling an
open cannabis project.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an open source software thing,
but applied to cannabis genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I wholeheartedly agree with and I
think is probably the best way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If things have been released commercially,
they are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: How best to deal with this, I think,
is to make this public domain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that capacity, that protects me,
I think, from getting that cease and
[SPEAKER_01]: desist letter, at least one way in which
to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as far as where Filos is right now,
I know they're providing the service,
[SPEAKER_01]: as are other companies, where you can have
your genetics identified and then
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with your name or company that
at least gives you some legal foothold in
[SPEAKER_01]: this whole thing as it unfolds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really don't know where these
companies are now.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, Filos was supposed to be
doing the cannabis genome project,
[SPEAKER_01]: which they're not anymore and I don't know
why.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why this went to a company in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I start getting some answers to this,
it'll become more clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, I do trust what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do agree with this open cannabis
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a woman, her name is Beth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on a panel with her at Hemfest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I meant to have her card and contact
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's actually doing this right now,
this open cannabis project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can find that information and send it to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she is, in earnest, attempting to make
this a reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, with agreeance, people like
myself, we can make that happen and then
[SPEAKER_01]: move forward from that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to jump off the whole legal downer,
one of the questions I wanted to ask you
[SPEAKER_02]: is, in your opinion, what differentiates
Flow from F13?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: F13 was from the floral line, the Flow
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: F13 was simply the label of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were down to the final selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had 12 jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was up in Vancouver, BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: They brought them over to me and I'm going
through those jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one, it was F13.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I went to it, I said,
oh my, hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had an immediate, very immediate
effect with the long-term onset.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just special.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could tell right away, you're a party
waiting to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I going to call this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked at the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: It said F13.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see an F, nice letter.
[SPEAKER_01]: 13, nice number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what got its label.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a more direct relative to Flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see how.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the description Jason King gave
F13, the compliment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason King gave F13 when he said,
smoking F13 is like smoking a Grateful
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead show.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of psychedelia, that's a pretty
high compliment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what it does though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flow is motivational and focused,
whereas F13 is more psychedelic focused.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is maybe a bit of an odd question,
but do you like Flow more than Blueberry?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's weird is when I talk to people
about this, especially the big name
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder friends I talk to, all of them
have this real memorable story about
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking Flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, oh, there's something about
Flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's a little bit of the
unsung hero?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: She doesn't have a lot of bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got a bit more of that musky,
temple ball, hashy aroma to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is nowhere near couch lock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couch lock people that smoke her,
what is this shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it away from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't enter her in cups because she's
got one of the slowest come ons.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 45 minutes to an hour before you're
fully appreciating what this herb does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a four to five hour effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of, yeah, I'm trapped on a desert
island.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to pick one strain and smoke for the
rest of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would probably be Flow over Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one question we had sent in by a good
friend, Mass Medical Strains, he said,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, he actually, in one of the
previous interviews, he recounted his
[SPEAKER_02]: little awesome story with Flow from when
he was younger.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said it was really impactful,
but he's packed a few pops of Flow and he
[SPEAKER_02]: said basically he's had trouble finding
the keeper he's looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he wanted to know, do you think it's a
little bit of a harder plant to wrangle
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it do a bit better outdoors or do you
think he should be able to do a ride
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know she likes outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: She likes to trail along.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can bend her, God, 20, 30 feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes she'll vine along, put out side
branches too that you can put wherever you
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of depends on what people are
looking for too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to realize those seeds are the
Flow, my Flow clone is the mother and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the Blueberry that's the father.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're seeing a bit of Blueberry
influence in that seed line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say this, both the F4 Flow and the
F4 Blueberry mother cuts are available.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are out commercially available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to establish someplace
that I could tell you to go and get them,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that hasn't happened yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of floated out, you know,
and sometimes a place succeeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are out there, I'll say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know JD has some in Eugene.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some in both Southern and Northern
California right now as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once they are well established where
they're at, I believe they will be
[SPEAKER_01]: commercially available and I can send you
somewhere to get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are the F4 mother Flow and
Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I did that, you know,
people said, we're amazed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did you release your mother stock?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, well, there's been enough seeds
that a good representation of her should
[SPEAKER_01]: be out there somewhere to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But mainly, this is the main thing,
I want people to know what my version,
[SPEAKER_01]: my idea of Blueberry and Flow are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best way to do that is through
their mother plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've held, you know, Flow,
even though she's 27 years old,
[SPEAKER_01]: 98, so what 20 years for the Blueberry
mother and father and hasn't lost anything
[SPEAKER_01]: in that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just sprung a good question to mine
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that time, you know, they're very old
cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you noticed any deterioration at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people sometimes reference
genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you believe in that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It might exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it does, it doesn't for these two.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years on now, they're not the same
mother in the same pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do have a rejuvenation method I like
to suggest to people, recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's taking, you know, mother I've
been working with all winter and taking
[SPEAKER_01]: her in April May, whenever you can get her
outside, take her outside, dump her out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the pot, cut those roots right off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take anything that is not a bright white
root, even when you're transplanting small
[SPEAKER_01]: things, anything that's wrapped tight or
discolored, pull right off.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant will love you for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: She will immediately put out new roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you put that plant in the ground
April May.
[SPEAKER_01]: She rejuvenates, comes back through one
leaflet, three leaflets, five leaflets,
[SPEAKER_01]: seven, nine, however many she's supposed
to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Late July, early August, take that cut,
take a bunch of cuts off of her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's your mother plant through the
winter again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that tends to rejuvenate,
bring these back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also heard that tissue culturing
numerous times where you reculture the
[SPEAKER_01]: culture like 13 times is supposed to bring
a plant back to an absolute state of
[SPEAKER_01]: health and vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a common theme that I've noticed within
your breeding work is that you tend to do
[SPEAKER_02]: inbreeding within your own lines,
mixing them together as opposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing in external things, especially
bringing in say like hype of the month
[SPEAKER_02]: strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you ever consider bringing in more
external things or are you just more
[SPEAKER_02]: content to work within your own creations?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have more in my library than I'm
going to be able to get to in my lifetime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four or 500 different varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have maybe 100 things that I've never
sprouted yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, a big enough space with time that
that can happen pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that's been happening for me is
I've been acquiring some land race
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only sprouted one out to kind of test
their authenticity in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're definitely unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And real character, a person that I met.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's kind of a funny story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met him in Michigan at the High Times
Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some seeds from Kashmir.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he showed them to me and I looked at
the seeds and I was stunned and impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recognized them and I go, oh,
these are very tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were tiny, dark, solid color,
no striping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And various or a couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had four like different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave him like four hundred dollars for
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we established a rapport and I've been
seeing him at various shows and he's been
[SPEAKER_01]: giving me a number of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have maybe 50 different land races now
from way back in India, Nepal,
[SPEAKER_01]: Thailand, South America, Africa,
just a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he even has some things from
Australia, Indonesia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all some of the seeds are huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sprouted out some Turkish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't grow them long enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in an R&D project, had to take them
down in eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably should have gone 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: Passed some on, though, to some friends
who are growing those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called it new running shoes and cologne.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of smell like so, you know,
unique things going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to sprouting those out
and then kind of redoing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also really like I have a bunch of
my F1s now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never frozen them, never refrigerated
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just kept them in a dark place.
[SPEAKER_01]: On occasion in the past, I've gotten them
to pop and put a tail out, but that's as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as they went.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd succumb to mold or mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not have the time or space to deal
with them, but I have a couple hundred of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I can just get a small handful of
those to sprout, which I'm sure given
[SPEAKER_01]: modern technology, we can we can pull off.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I need is a male and a female and I
can do the whole thing all over again from
[SPEAKER_01]: scratch, only this time knowing full well
what I'm what I'm looking for and
[SPEAKER_01]: isolating in those ways in an environment
that's number one, big enough and safe
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I would like to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as any work, hybridized work,
no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last time I did anybody else's hybrid work
was back in, good God, the 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I regretted it every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, why did I do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've got other things I need to focus
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, people fall in love with
plants, structure of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like them to get big.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like colors, flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but that finished product,
how does it smoke?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it smoke?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that that takes some some effort and
some focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to touch on the land races for a
moment, if you did, say, pop through them
[SPEAKER_02]: and you had a good germination rate,
which would be the one you'd be most
[SPEAKER_02]: wanting to work with first if you could
only pick one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you know, that would present itself
with its with its smoke, with the flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: the concentrate or the finished product.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that finished product make me
feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could come from anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I'd never gotten to that I was
always interested was Equatorial African.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have some from another person,
a guy I met who is from Ghana.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was born there and grew up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's now here in the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had access to some Ghana's genetics
that I have as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have some things from Togo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be interested in Kenya as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything Equatorial, the black African
land race, I think would have some
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting aspects to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, another thing going into the future
is going to be testing, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how scientists do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how the lab or the grow in
Mississippi, the government grow that's in
[SPEAKER_01]: Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go strictly by, you know,
where the plant came from, crossing it to
[SPEAKER_01]: itself and then testing the finished
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to guide where a lot of
things go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think also answer a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: THCV, CBDV, CBG, I think is another hot
item right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm noticing it in a happy pussy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has some 1% CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's something about, I was reading
some article about CBG with
[SPEAKER_01]: beta-karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is some very unique recessive
genotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to, I think, influence the
way a lot of things are going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going to be in demand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, when we're on a level playing field
and when we can offer this as a legitimate
[SPEAKER_01]: marketable pharmaceutical botanical,
things are going to change, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Say a terpene becomes popular and some
company just needs bucket loads of this
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you have the strain that's really
putting out high in that terpene,
[SPEAKER_01]: it puts you ahead of the game and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these things, they're going to unfold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as which area, highland tie,
the area Myanmar used to be called Burma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's still a Burma too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But up there, that high Northern Laos,
the Golden Triangle, any place that
[SPEAKER_01]: poppies do well, wine, tobacco,
cannabis seems to do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there are two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there is one other thing I could
add in regards to testing, the testing of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and how, in regards to the
testing of cannabis, what we lack in their
[SPEAKER_01]: industry right now is a standard,
a standard for testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on is people are,
in essence, concentrating or isolating the
[SPEAKER_01]: most potent parts of their plant in order
to determine its potency and overall
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to pass on that what I
plan to do when I do work in the future
[SPEAKER_01]: for my own analysis of these things is I
want to take near maturity, right near
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest, an entire live branch,
stem, leaves, buds and all, get that bone
[SPEAKER_01]: dry and then test that, grind it up into a
powder and test that powder randomly,
[SPEAKER_01]: which will then let me know the exact
specific potency and characteristic of
[SPEAKER_01]: what's in these whole plants as opposed to
just these isolated, very resinous areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you're gonna test that way,
then just test for concentrate,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're gonna concentrate, then
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I want to know what's in
that whole plant, including shade leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: stems, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even roots, I mean, there's some
interesting things going on in roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another thing to take into
consideration and to look at in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It raises an interesting question in my
mind because I was reading the other day
[SPEAKER_02]: that one of the common reasons that
samples in California had failed over the
[SPEAKER_02]: past year, not the most common reason,
but it was one of the common reasons,
[SPEAKER_02]: was that it said homogeneity among sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought, is that like what I think
it is where they're saying that they took
[SPEAKER_02]: samples from different parts of the tree
or whatever and it was all homogenous and
[SPEAKER_02]: they were like, there's something up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There should be some variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that kind of what they were getting at,
do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but when you do isolate down
to very specific parts of the flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to find similarities across
samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, it's another fascinating
subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need the standardization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back when the government used to test in
the 60s and 70s, they would just take a
[SPEAKER_01]: random loop out of wood or whatever they
were dealing with, which is part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: reason why I think the highest THC
percentages we were seeing back then was
[SPEAKER_01]: about 7%, 10% I think on the Maui Waui was
the highest back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also an indication that there's
other things going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other things to look for, other
cannabinoids, other terpenes, and we've
[SPEAKER_01]: got a lot of work cut out for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think maybe a better way of
phrasing what I was asking was,
[SPEAKER_02]: I commonly hear people say that,
you know, buds at the top of the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: will have maybe a little bit lower levels
of cannabinoids than ones that say the
[SPEAKER_02]: shoulders of the plants, because,
you know, they're not copying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I guess it does come down to like,
yeah, where are people taking these
[SPEAKER_02]: samples from specifically?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess your solution addresses that
problem, or is that what you're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just for a side note there,
back in the day, my favorite buds on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant were those little popcorn things way
deep inside that weren't getting upset or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, too much exposure to light or
air.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the most interesting,
and all over the plant there's interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: things going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, taking a whole branch,
leaves, stems and all, gives me a much
[SPEAKER_01]: better understanding of how that whole
plant is reacting, especially to the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: next to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I test them all in that way,
then I can really begin to suss some of
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as, you know, which area,
Highland Thai, the area Myanmar used to be
[SPEAKER_01]: called Burma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's still a Burma too,
but up there that high Northern Laos,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Golden Triangle, any place that
poppies do well, wine, tobacco,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis seems to do well there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an interesting analogy I never
quite thought of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know, however, and it was brought up
that you've got a neat little story about
[SPEAKER_02]: when you got to smoke some black African
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you mind telling us that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's probably the strongest herb
I'd ever encountered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was straight herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tasted like, you know, the stuff you
find in a gutter that dried up,
[SPEAKER_01]: just that vegetative, basic, rotten,
molded, vegetative.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was black, dry, crumbly, tasted like
leaves, didn't have a particular flavor,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak, kind of sagey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pin-joint, a pin-joint of stuff between
four adult-sized people, man, and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, almost like DMT, a cartoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just, points of reality, it became
different references.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lasted a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never possessed any other than in a
rolled joint form.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did get to roll the joints, you know,
saw it from the bags on more than one
[SPEAKER_01]: occasion.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was two occasions that I had access.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I smoked it three times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing PCP at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of the drugs that was
available, and we had one that was PCP in
[SPEAKER_01]: here, but no, it was pot, it was straight
pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: A very dream, dream state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reality shifted, and you just looked at
life differently, completely differently
[SPEAKER_01]: for that whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was giddy, very goofy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't help but laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real tight, you know, cheek muscles.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bit overwhelming,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what's dissociative in that regard,
where it could evoke paranoid thinking,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the things associated with the heavy
psychedelic dose, but yeah, it was
[SPEAKER_01]: impressive herb, and everything I've read
about, all the people I've talked to that
[SPEAKER_01]: have had seen the similar things,
only had the same experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have had reports of levitation,
and there's all kinds of silly things on
[SPEAKER_01]: this herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to get some more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a weird television thing years ago,
man, I was in Michigan, this was still in
[SPEAKER_01]: the 70s, and it was some kind of a
documentary thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in black and white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I just had a black and white TV back
in the day, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these guys were going around all these
different hash places, and just
[SPEAKER_01]: documenting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They showed Afghanistan where they had
mules, or donkeys up on the press,
[SPEAKER_01]: and how they squeezed it out, and this
black goo was coming out the edges,
[SPEAKER_01]: shiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they went to these pygmies in Kenya,
and the herb plants just looked like
[SPEAKER_01]: hedges, giant bushes out in the bush.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the bush, and these pygmies,
these little pygmy people were rubbing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: hand rubbing it, and putting it in a big
chillum, and smoking it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you could see on that video,
the sheen to that hash, how sticky it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: and how high they got.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't like a pro, it was not a pro
hash thing, it was an anti-drug kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: documentary, where they were just showing
all this hash production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that's the stuff I'm after,
put it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ed, just out of curiosity,
where were you when you were able to try
[SPEAKER_02]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Detroit area, again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it from a cousin, my cousin,
the drummer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it was import or grown in the
States?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was import.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was African weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a jazz musician, he taught jazz
drumming, as a matter of fact,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he had those connections in the
Detroit area.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that regard, for history, I don't know
if you're familiar with a book called
[SPEAKER_01]: Really the Blues, by Mez Mezro,
M-E-Z-Z, M-E-Z-Z-R-O-W, I believe his name
[SPEAKER_01]: is spelled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fascinating read, I don't know why it's
not required reading in college,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's even out of print.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wrote this in the 40s, he was a pot
dealer in Harlem, a Jewish guy,
[SPEAKER_01]: played clarinet, jazz musician,
selling what was called a golden leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Golden leaf came up from New Orleans,
it was grown in the Caribbean from African
[SPEAKER_01]: stock that came over with the slave trade,
and this was the herb of the jazz
[SPEAKER_01]: musicians, the golden leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: The book has a bunch of amazing,
it's just a fascinating read.
[SPEAKER_01]: They used to call Pop Mez in his honor,
but this African herb, it goes back quite
[SPEAKER_01]: a ways, burrows, the same thing,
it was growing in Mexico, and he went down
[SPEAKER_01]: to Mexico to grow some of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gold, that Oaxacan, was along those
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: That had a very frankincense, cedar,
candy cedar incense, smell flavor,
[SPEAKER_01]: Catholic church incense, very much,
and again, just enlightening, now that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff was very pleasurable, see the
African, that was more, it's like DMT,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was more serious, whereas the golds
were by far more pleasurable, powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another herb that got uncomfortable at
times was any of the island herb,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaican, Hawaiian, could be far too
potent sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all just like, I never would have
thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something we have heard before is that the
golds, as you referenced, were very
[SPEAKER_02]: popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that at the time people were
aware of what they were getting,
[SPEAKER_02]: or do you think they took it a bit for
granted?
[SPEAKER_01]: My ilk, my crowd, we knew, and when you
stumbled upon the good shit, when there
[SPEAKER_01]: was all that dirt weed going around,
we would pool our resources and buy a
[SPEAKER_01]: quantity, try and get enough to get a
pound, get a much more reasonable deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like $250 a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be, geez, $90 a kilo in bricks,
but generally, I think I was paying about
[SPEAKER_01]: $200 to $300 per pound for the top shelf
stuff, whereas the more commercial things
[SPEAKER_01]: were probably $150.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we would pool our resources and
buy the good shit and then have it for a
[SPEAKER_01]: while, sell however much we knew about it,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like wine, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to be a connoisseur or a
wine expert to just know what you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally speaking, when people are
introduced to what is classified as good
[SPEAKER_01]: wine, they tend to smack their lips and
go, oh, that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very similar with herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just kind of gravitate towards what
you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just the flavor, it's then
the accompanying feeling that goes with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas wine generally tends to have,
you know, you drink enough of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: the same feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Old Time Moonshine, this is kind of an
indica dominant strain you released in the
[SPEAKER_02]: past, which didn't really have any
apparent relationships to the blue family.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing which strikes my interest
about this is, you know, obviously not
[SPEAKER_02]: really related to a lot of other stocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first thing I started to wonder is
how many of these types of projects or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, kind of strains do you have in
your library where they are actually just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, kind of unrelated?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Old Time Moonshine was part of what
went on up in Canada in 2004 or around
[SPEAKER_01]: then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone with a nice big house set up,
600 plants, was able to dedicate the space
[SPEAKER_01]: to do an R&D and then a seed run from that
R&D.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the biggest that I got to,
you know, witness firsthand of my personal
[SPEAKER_01]: stock being grown out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these were things that presented
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old Time Moonshine was one of them that
was in, I think, a Blue Moonshine
[SPEAKER_01]: designated stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really wasn't that involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I put my hands on it, saw it,
smoked it, but it wasn't that personally
[SPEAKER_01]: involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to recall if she was strictly
green, if she had the purples in her or
[SPEAKER_01]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know that in the final analysis,
again, my primary concern was the smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: and how did things smoke?
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that capacity, it passed the muster
to be of the potency to qualify for a
[SPEAKER_01]: Moonshine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually came up with the name Old
Time Moonshine, assigned that to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was only one plant, all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a big plant that went to seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there were about 1,600 seeds
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was back when seeds were in 10
packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was only about 160 packs of those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like any release, you know,
there's an initial sale because people are
[SPEAKER_01]: interested and you gotta wait for smoke
reports and things to come in for sales to
[SPEAKER_01]: pick up after that initial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Old Time Moonshine just kind of
moved along, you know, as we sold our
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, then, I think High Times did a
piece on it and Jason King did something
[SPEAKER_01]: on it that really set the hype again.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a surge in buying of those seeds
and they sold out, all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were no more of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of adds to the hype in a big
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, again, this was mid-late 2000s,
right after the Mark Emery bust,
[SPEAKER_01]: in and around the time of the Heaven
Stairway bust, people were on edge,
[SPEAKER_01]: people were looking to you know,
seed hoarding was a big phenomenon right
[SPEAKER_01]: then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone who had bought two packs of
those Old Time Moonshine put them on one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the auction boards that was left
probably on Gypsy Nirvana's site at that
[SPEAKER_01]: time, I forget where, on an auction and
they got $1,000 a pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, on a 10 seed pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that then, I think, just fueled the
hype a whole bunch more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, from my perspective, you know,
that's what happened with Old Time
[SPEAKER_01]: Moonshine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, re-releasing that, I passed some of
that stock on again to both my son and
[SPEAKER_01]: some people in Michigan, growing that out
now and a great success, they're loving
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's passing the muster, so we might see
that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms, that's kind of, that's what
happened with it and that's how hype
[SPEAKER_01]: works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, now I get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, there's this kind of interesting
prevailing mindset in the community
[SPEAKER_02]: whereby if someone stops offering a
strain, not because, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they think it's bad and it shouldn't be
offered, but for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're no longer offering it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally speaking, if someone else begins
to offer it, it's kind of considered okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about the fact that Mosca
does that with the Old Time Moonshine?
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be, the way it is for tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, whatever laws there are for
tomatoes and tomato seeds, what Burpee
[SPEAKER_01]: goes through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, from my perspective,
you look at it like this, so use tomatoes
[SPEAKER_01]: as an analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go into public domain stock and I work
just heritage strains and I come up with a
[SPEAKER_01]: tomato that is small, it's blue,
and it has a taste like a blueberry and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're blueberry tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I market them as both blueberry
tomatoes, you know, leasing that rights to
[SPEAKER_01]: whomever or I sell seeds of blueberry
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if I lease that out to Burpee or
whomever and they're selling blueberry
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes, can, you know, and they're doing
it for a while and either for whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons, crop failure, supply is much
higher than demand, they cannot supply the
[SPEAKER_01]: market for a given period of time for
whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that give the general public the
right to buy a pack of blueberry tomato
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and then offer them on the market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Legally, no, from my understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, all I care about is exactly
whatever the hell it is for tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, let's do that for herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something for the lawyers to
work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's an incidental, it's a
distraction, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I mean, I come from this
kind of open source place where I do
[SPEAKER_01]: believe that even given intellectual
property rights, that all intellectual
[SPEAKER_01]: property is public domain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it's published, once it's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the analogy I like to use is like,
it's a big pond, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that pond are these fish and that
fish is the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could use Einstein, all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Einstein made the right fishing tackle,
the right gear, and he caught E equals MC
[SPEAKER_01]: squared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Einstein caught it, all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But he gave it to the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here you go, here's E equals MC
squared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in fairness that the way it would
go forward is that fine, everyone can take
[SPEAKER_01]: E equals MC squared and run with it,
but if you start making money off of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you owe something to Einstein,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or back to the pond, one or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as long as that cycle is
completed, hey, this is completely
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But when people then, you know,
take claim rights to things, then that
[SPEAKER_01]: gets murky and then litigation gets
complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it becomes a serious waste of time,
energy, and money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I get you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It brings up this interesting concept
because there's currently this topic in
[SPEAKER_02]: the community of, you know, what level of
onus is there on people to reach out and
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe ask for permission before using a
strain and a cross?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of, to me, it's a bit of a
notion of no-brainer, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: crossing two different strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it gets very confusing when,
yeah, when you say you're doing an F2 of
[SPEAKER_02]: someone's work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I prefaced it with that
initial bit because, like, the thing I
[SPEAKER_02]: notice is, for example, Tom Hill,
he's not around anymore, and there are a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of people who F2 his lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if he was around, that would be,
like, such a no-no.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact he's not around, people
almost view it as, like, you're doing a
[SPEAKER_02]: community service.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just, I'm so intrigued by how,
you know, the mindset around this all
[SPEAKER_02]: works because it's, like, under just these
minor little tweaks in the situation,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's just, like, a total flip on
whether people support the concept or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in your situation, yeah,
like, you're still around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of raises the question of,
did you stop releasing it because maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: you didn't want it out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Things like that are what I think about,
at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, all-time moonshine?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, like I said, there was one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were 1,600 seeds, 160 packs,
which were enough to make that hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to finish up on the pond and the fish
analogy, the pond and the fish belong to
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though Einstein caught E equals MC
squared with his fishing thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: it still belongs to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only time it gets murky,
the only thing that needs to be regulated,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think this is a big-picture thing
legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, the most dangerous substance on the
face of the earth that needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated is money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once we get a grip on that,
I think, you know, society will do fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're not controlling money,
and we're allowing that concept of the
[SPEAKER_01]: golden rule being that those with the gold
make the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And historically, that's never worked out
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it won't this time either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's unfortunate that the levels of
suffering, you know, that can happen as a
[SPEAKER_01]: result of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, the pond, the fish belong to
everybody, but you have to give credit to
[SPEAKER_01]: whomever wrestled out that fish from the
pond in the first place and take care of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things work themselves out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just as a quick little wrap-up,
was the great crush of kind of a similar
[SPEAKER_02]: nature to the old-time moonshine,
where it was kind of something you offered
[SPEAKER_02]: for a bid, and now it's kind of gone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or was there a little bit of a different
backstory on that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a blueberry line,
blueberry-leaning, but had a much more
[SPEAKER_01]: grape flavor, and was very productive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just 15%, 20%, sometimes 25% more on the
plant with the same amount of quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are, it is re-released right now in
what we call a throwback form,
[SPEAKER_01]: where we've taken a bunch of the
grape-crush seeds, grown them out,
[SPEAKER_01]: done a proper selection for the mother,
and then just used the F4 blueberry dad
[SPEAKER_01]: who's, he's got merit all the way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those seeds are doing the exact same
thing in terms of production and the grape
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if my son is still continuing
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a lot on his plate right now,
and once again, it's space and time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to have a meeting with him here
soon to see what he does have and doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything I have released can be released
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be seen again at some point in
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, just as a little curiosity
point, I, this could be a silly question,
[SPEAKER_02]: excuse me if it is, were you the creator
of Skywalker?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or did they, did Dutch Passion do that
just with your work?
[SPEAKER_01]: They just did that with my work,
and that was kind of after the fact,
[SPEAKER_01]: after I had left being there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never got anything for that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was just a little one I needed
to slot in, I didn't know where to slot
[SPEAKER_02]: that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I'm glad you did, because that's
one of those that few people really know
[SPEAKER_01]: about, and that that was my genetics,
the things that I'd left up with Dutch
[SPEAKER_01]: Passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if he worked any other
genetics in with that, but I do know that
[SPEAKER_01]: mine were responsible, at least in the
initial description of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was able to try some in the
States, and it was incredible quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of all I can assume, I think that this
particular cutting was kind of tapping
[SPEAKER_02]: more into kind of the flow side of things,
because it just, everything people have
[SPEAKER_02]: ever told me about flow, it's just what
this, and it was given to me as purple
[SPEAKER_02]: Skywalker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, what do you mean purple?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it just happens to be purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, no, this cut,
it's like, and it looked kind of like that
[SPEAKER_02]: stacked Calix Fox tail photo of flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, again, I, yeah, I love that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was always curious, but something I
wanted to ask you though is given your
[SPEAKER_02]: work is so extensive, extensively worked
generation wise, how do you feel about the
[SPEAKER_02]: fact that, you know, a lot of the current
breeders are releasing F1s these days?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you, you know, do you have any opinions
on that or where do you sit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's, it's not something I really
have the time or energy to focus on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, my only contact with what other people
are doing in the industries is when I
[SPEAKER_01]: attend shows and I happen to walk around
and notice, I know that right now there is
[SPEAKER_01]: a huge surge of new genetics companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them seem to be banding together,
you know, sharing booth space and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of distribution in that way a lot
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they, they, it's genetics companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, basically just pick up any recent
issue of high times and flip through who
[SPEAKER_01]: has the most full page ads kind of gives
you an indication of who's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: spending money on what that also,
and booth spaces at, at these events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those booths are hundreds of
thousands of dollars worth of space and
[SPEAKER_01]: people and, but there, there's your
indicator, you know, just follow the
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you feel it's possible to remain
relevant within the scene without engaging
[SPEAKER_02]: strongly in, you know, advertising and
social media and stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think that for the most part,
you could look at your own brand and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a little bit of that going on
where, you know, still doing very well,
[SPEAKER_02]: yet you're not, you know, like one of
these people who's posting up stuff every
[SPEAKER_02]: day and trying to like everyone's comments
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not, I mean, this whole social
media phenomenon, it's a new thing and it
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of boggles my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the, the, the platforms themselves
don't worry me so much as how quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: people embrace this as normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's not, it's only just begun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, these, it remains to be seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's far too early to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think now, right now in this,
in this day and age and in this market,
[SPEAKER_01]: yes, in the States, especially I would
imagine, so in Europe, Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably Australia too, to be,
um, very active in, in these, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: on these platforms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's a, for me again, it's,
it's an incidental.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I need to focus on finding those
things that make me feel good when I smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in that capacity, I've got my work
cut out for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but for other people, yeah,
I, I see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the time, the competition is fierce.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it were fair, I mean, if people
played fair, that'd be one thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but people don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been good on for going out for a
long time where people use, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: certain bulletin boards or whatever to
tout one brand and, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: praise another, um, supposedly in,
in this completely sincere way,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all marketing strategies and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the same when I was a kid growing
up was TV and commercials and we had to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn, you know, Oh God, yes, this is how
they're trying to affect us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully some of us will see through
it and learn from it and, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, be able to progress beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping at some point, some day,
just the merit of the herb itself is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be what, what guides its path.
[SPEAKER_01]: Future, uh, the, the, the good smoke,
you know, and that was, that was it when
[SPEAKER_01]: the brotherhood days, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when it was the good smoke demand,
supply and demand and people knowing what
[SPEAKER_01]: they like and wanting what they like and
seeking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something I did want to ask you is what
was it that caused you to go back to the
[SPEAKER_02]: drawing board and to rework the blueberry
sativa line and to ultimately kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: derive the Vanna Luna and the Kakao Kush
from it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the blueberry sativa or what came to
be known as blue satellite, that was work
[SPEAKER_01]: I did with Breeder Steve and, uh,
Breeder Steve was another Canadian
[SPEAKER_01]: originally who then went to Europe,
uh, first to Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it had quite a few successes there,
but had a nasty habit of burning his
[SPEAKER_01]: bridges and ended up leaving Switzerland,
um, and going to Spain and kind of doing
[SPEAKER_01]: the same thing there, accomplishing a lot,
uh, quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I went over there, took, took genetics
with me and, and that's where we came up
[SPEAKER_01]: with, with those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, at that point in time, it was my,
my next blueberry was out flow was out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what has to be next.
[SPEAKER_01]: This blueberry sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once that was out, then, you know,
um, I brought came back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working on my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things really didn't work out up in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so that was like, Oh, five Oh six that
I did the Kakao Kush and Vanna Luna,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, from similar lines, um, matter of,
well, exactly the same lines as,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, the blue satellite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you think that the Vanna Luna
has kind of gone on to get its own cult
[SPEAKER_02]: following in the way that flow almost has,
because I find the variegation is
[SPEAKER_02]: undeniably something which just really
draws people to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have to agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another one of my favorites
actually, probably more so than blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, I describe as being comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just plain comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for again, pain management,
it was, it was wonderful in that capacity,
[SPEAKER_01]: very clear headed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Coco Kush, the same thing,
although Coco Kush had a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: of a wild ride to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called it a little bit more like a
roller coaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, so, uh, what was the question in
relation to that Vanna Luna and Coco Kush?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you, oh, well, basically I was just
wondering, do you find that, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: there is a bit of a cult following for
Vanna Luna?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, same with, you know, flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was sitting there going, God,
I really wish flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, flow again, a breeder, Steve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeder Steve recognized flow in 1996.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won the cannabis cup in Europe for
cannabis culture magazine because breeder
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve was sent over there to cover the
cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sampled all the varieties that were
entered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time I had been bringing my
seed, getting my seed there in the bud
[SPEAKER_01]: because to me, that was the way to ensure
number one authenticity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in vacuum sealed in bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then number two, I have smoke and
seeded smoke is, it's got a special
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristic to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it was some of that seeded flow
that when breeder Steve was there,
[SPEAKER_01]: we broke it out, rolled up some joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looks at me, he says, this is the best
thing I've smoked here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so yeah, he recognized it in 1996,
but for anything connoisseur, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes a while, I think for,
for, for it to catch on, even if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't know, some things get too
popular and it sort of waters them down
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last little question about the Vanna Luna
and the leaf variegation I wanted to ask
[SPEAKER_02]: you is, had you ever noticed anything
about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And did it like ever relate to the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the reason I ask is two reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, I've bred a plant, which is kind of
near and dear to my heart and it does it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't really noticed too much
effect except for like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of an aesthetic appeal, which I think
a lot of people like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the other end of the spectrum,
a really commonly highly regarded cut
[SPEAKER_02]: within the States, the chem dog D it does
variegation and people, uh, kind of view
[SPEAKER_02]: it as like a negative thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm wondering, where do you see,
do you, do you think it's purely aesthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: or does it play a role?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, I think I know where it comes
from and it comes from, uh, mainly the
[SPEAKER_01]: tie, uh, both chocolate tie and the
highland tie, which in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: were subjected at some time in their
lineage to what is called a Colchicine
[SPEAKER_01]: regimen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Colchicine is a toxic substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a medicine used to treat gout.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it is also, um, Oh, what do you call
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you mix up genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a modulator, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, the theory goes you take many
seeds, um, soak them in Colchicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only a few of them will sprout and they'll
be wretchedly deformed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You breed further with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're supposed to be toxic actually,
a few generations out, but very specific,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, phenotypic expressions can be
isolated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, well, uh, seedless watermelons,
uh, few other things came from,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Colchicine, uh, mutagenic,
um, regimen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, evidence is the variegation in
the leaf, the twisted curling and also
[SPEAKER_01]: albino patching.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the albino patching is very geometric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it, it happens in specific places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you count things out,
number of leaflets, what side of the leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: you will see the identical patterns on
opposite sides of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it was, uh, may have been what
made the tie the tie as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So back to kind of one of the strains,
which no longer being offered the true
[SPEAKER_02]: berry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what combines the indica and
the sativa sides of the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people just went looking at that
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might think that that would be kind
of the masterpiece for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you view it like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you view it as kind of the ultimate
expression of blueberry, or it's just more
[SPEAKER_02]: of like a cool merging of the indica and
the sativa lines?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, more on the sativa side.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about the true blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, that was another one of the,
um, Canadian offerings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a little more sour,
um, on, uh, you know, lemony citrus,
[SPEAKER_01]: piney side, uh, more, uh, spear shape to
the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the domestic, uh, U S blueberry is
the stretch indica where you have the nice
[SPEAKER_01]: golf ball bud formations, um, placed
along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long internodes, uh, and a bit sweeter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you know, again, they both,
they both have their merit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and there, there was a limited
offering of those as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're out floating around,
uh, doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably we'll re-release that in some
kind of a throwback offering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, again, I'm just looking forward to in
the future, being able to go back into my
[SPEAKER_01]: library without being limited so much by
space and time where I can grow out at
[SPEAKER_01]: least several hundred plants at a time
again, and search for these various
[SPEAKER_01]: expressions among others.
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been things that I've lost that
I want to go back and find.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have notes where they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cherry in particular, very, very distinct
cherry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't think anyone has ever
mentioned cherry as a, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the possible variations from your
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, I think that'll generate a lot
of interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the woods as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cedar in particular, incense type things,
um, have merit to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, one thing I wanted to ask about
was velvet rush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this just essentially like,
well, on paper, it looks like it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: the highland Thai Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it differ to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things it says online about
it is that it's, it's quite hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why, where does that comment kind of come
from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now velvet rush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking about blue velvet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's just listed purely as velvet
rush online.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says it's just a, like a, an unknown F
generation of the highland Thai Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be totally incorrect though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think it's something that,
that I offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might be somebody else's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone's doing something with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did have, I did have a blue velvet
and you were, you were mentioning the Fox
[SPEAKER_01]: tail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the one in the book where there
are leaves like coming out and it's long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, that was mislabeled as flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was actually blue velvet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably aware of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that photo is one of the most
widely plagiarized photo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I see that photo on so many strains,
most notably on, you know, random European
[SPEAKER_02]: websites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen that one being labeled as a Dr.
Grinspoon, you know, like that iconic,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, calyx stacking Dr. Grinspoon photo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so yeah, interesting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I noticed is whenever I'm
talking to someone about, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ short's work, I know how they're legit
cause they'll say something like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, do you know about toe jam or red
eyed bride?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll be like, ah, this guy knows what
he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give us a little bit of info?
[SPEAKER_02]: On those ones and the whole collaboration
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chimera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, again, that was when I was up in,
uh, Vancouver, um, mid 2004, 2005,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he was establishing his presence in
the community as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and doing his thing, uh, a lot like
breeder Steve, but he is more,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, scientific discipline, uh,
you know, focused in that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he has a degree in, in genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, um, up there doing his thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still, I haven't spoken with these people,
been in contact in a long time since,
[SPEAKER_01]: since then, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those projects, were they just kind
of, you know, whatever few, or did you
[SPEAKER_02]: find anything you liked out of them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, again, I have so many, the,
the, the grow we did, it was 600 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I forget 18, 22,000 Watts,
something like that old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: HIDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so there was a lot to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had, I think 12 resonance males,
all from this one blueberry line.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we, we picked the, the male,
the B, I forget his number, there was a B
[SPEAKER_01]: 133.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, there's probably people online
that know better than me right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's legend and is going around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have copies of those seeds as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, and it was harried.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there was a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was pretty much overwhelmed with
doing my own things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to see other people's things,
but, uh, I don't have enough real
[SPEAKER_01]: authority to, to comment, um, one way or
another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's interesting is when you mentioned
that, uh, B 133, I'm just looking through
[SPEAKER_02]: the fan submitted questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone actually submitted that exact
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, can you tell us more about the
blueberry B 133 male?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Chimera, um, was it that one or there
was another male, it was a B something
[SPEAKER_01]: male and he self the male, um,
turned the male female.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was another process and made a bunch of
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some of those as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chimera is very focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm, I'm, I'm not sure what,
what he's up to these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish him well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I know he had some, some family issues
when, when I was leaving there and he was
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with that a lot, but I,
I'm pretty sure he still has a pretty good
[SPEAKER_01]: presence, um, in the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hope anyhow, if not check them
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel responsible for having
converted a good proportion of the
[SPEAKER_02]: community to the 11, 13 life cycle?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think you should.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how much of the community is
flipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone who's switched on, I find is doing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in, in all, again, honesty,
that came to me from an old timer,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, nine mid eighties, um, guy named Sonny
Becker.
[SPEAKER_01]: He passed away of cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in 86, he was this old biker guy
that made lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought my first lights from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little company called Agri light
out of a junction city, Oregon,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was there at a, with him and he
goes, Oh, make, make your lights near
[SPEAKER_01]: nighttime a little bit longer than your
daytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you, it's the thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, Sonny, he was, they,
they, these, these guys, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they knew their shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were, um, wrapping their own
ballasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like getting copper wire and they
knew you go so many loops this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many loops that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hook it to this wire onto this little
bulb thing, put it with this, this little
[SPEAKER_01]: capacitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thingy on there and boom, you got
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but he, yeah, he was the one that,
that passed it onto me and I had done it
[SPEAKER_01]: ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the plants take in nourishment during
the day, which is light primarily,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they, they put it on at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can add to production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the main thing is, uh, phenotypic
reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will see, uh, phenotypes that you
don't do not see on the 1212 on certain
[SPEAKER_01]: strains, especially a lot of mine,
uh, things will present themselves that
[SPEAKER_01]: don't present themselves on a 1212.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, I've certainly found that,
um, you get like, uh, a more kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: flavorful and potent expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's so weird, but yeah,
I really do notice that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something I wanted to run by
because we haven't touched on it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: What type of grow style do you like to
use?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, are you organic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you bottled nutrients?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, organic soil with as few nutrients as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, right now, the mix I like,
it comes out of Eugene down to earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, their organic cocoa choir blend is,
is really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a company doing worm castings,
wonder worm out of British Columbia that
[SPEAKER_01]: has organic worm castings, very pure,
very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, fortify the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I had some people that were working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to do some branding thing for
an organic soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were doing, it was water only,
a complete water only soil and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, uh, that they're, they're waiting for
certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're up in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I need to test it myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but other than that, yeah,
just fortifying a soil, uh, plus outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer outdoor over indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a waste, you know, just such a
waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I forget what it was 800 pounds of
coal to make one pound of pot in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity, how accurate that is,
you know, I don't know, but it's been
[SPEAKER_01]: bandied about a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, any, any, when you've got the big
highlight in the sky, um, places like
[SPEAKER_01]: Southern Nevada, especially California,
um, just the opportunities there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan, where you have incredible soil,
Michigan has really unique soil composites
[SPEAKER_01]: in places that make unique cherries and
apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that the herb, you know,
can find its sweet spots there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, sweet spots outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yep, our organic soil all the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to do a hydro,
um, aquaponics that is, uh, organic,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, hydroponics is a way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flavors just, just great all the way
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then do you find that that's purely a
preference thing or do you find that kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of like the medicinal properties and the
more kind of complex and nuanced parts,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, are more pronounced in organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I haven't done it any other way,
so I don't have the comparison to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just, it just makes common sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, those things you're putting in
the plant and the fiber of that plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're smoking it in, in terms of a
whole plant in a joint or a bowl,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you're consuming those things in your
lungs, through your lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody studies that.
[SPEAKER_01]: FDA doesn't study smoking fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The eating, yeah, but eating is a,
is a completely different process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where are the guinea pigs?
[SPEAKER_01]: So far so good though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the cannabis acts enough as a
protectant that whatever nasty things ends
[SPEAKER_01]: up in there, uh, it kind of gets
compensated for somehow by the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're at events, you know,
the cups and whatnot, I'm sure plenty of
[SPEAKER_02]: people come up and maybe they want to show
you some of your work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've grown out.
[SPEAKER_02]: How often is it that you'll smoke
something of that and you're really kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of blown away?
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I do sample everything people give
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think the best compliment would be
what I returned to.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I go to something a second,
a third time and it's like, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, that that's got my interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say this, that what I have done
with these samples people give me is I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been saving them and I had been collecting
them for about 10 years and I had four or
[SPEAKER_01]: five pounds and I knew a processor,
somebody I really liked his, his method.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was butane, but he was very,
very on his game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, here, do, do something with
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he made a shatter out of that and he
named it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought it was very appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: He called it the people's choice because
it was everybody's stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now when, as people give me stuff,
I let people know, I go, Hey, this is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go in the next batch of the
people's choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're about six years away from it,
I think right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, when it, and it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was some of the best stuff I had smoked
in, in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and it's, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately I have little, I have some
of it stuck to the paper, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: for one of those, Oh, I need to visit this
again one more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the, the people's choice,
it was, it was dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smelled like top shelf Moroccan hash
and had that flavor to that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: sandalwood flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, very pleasant, very pleasant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, now everyone knows what they're
contributing to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, this was a little personal one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to ask you, I grew out a pack of
blueberry and I found that the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the keeper of, so to speak from that
packet, it was kind of almost a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: skunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might, it might sound weird,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a bit skunky after smoking a lot of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had this kind of epiphany.
[SPEAKER_02]: It clicked on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like the blueberry profile to me is
like skunk, like a cheesy skunk with an
[SPEAKER_02]: extra sweet component on the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost if you broke blueberry down
into say like a top end, a middle and a
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom, the cheesy skunk is the bottom
too, but it's missing the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever noticed anything like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, it's probably just a really
weird question to ask, but it just blew my
[SPEAKER_02]: mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, wow, like I,
cause I, at first I was like, how did I
[SPEAKER_02]: get these weird kind of skunky Fino,
but it makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, and I, you know, I adore it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and those things present themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I refer to it as musky for what,
what I get is the skunk skunk has it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's loamy, almost kind of loamy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other side of that, when it
doesn't quite get to blueberry is anise or
[SPEAKER_01]: licorice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can get that licorice nice and
sweet, the three day dark before the chop
[SPEAKER_01]: helps a lot with those particular
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so, so that's, that's kind of
what I look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the sweet, getting that sweet in there
is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one thing I wanted to run by you
basically was, I don't know if this is
[SPEAKER_02]: true.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might, you know, you might be able
to set the record straight, but basically
[SPEAKER_02]: I was reading, uh, some kind of history
blurb from Vic High, the breeder from,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, British Columbia seed organization
association, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, really famous breeder sadly
passed away not too long ago, but in one
[SPEAKER_02]: of his strains, there's some blue berry
genetics in there and it has this little
[SPEAKER_02]: note.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, Oh, please note our blueberry
derives from different origins to DJ
[SPEAKER_02]: shorts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it made me think, are you aware of any
blueberry that's derived from anything
[SPEAKER_02]: other than your work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like someone who's just happened to cross
A and B and they're like, Oh, I got this
[SPEAKER_02]: really blueberry type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, cause I'm not aware of anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, not specifically, but how many
things are floating around out there
[SPEAKER_01]: through how many hands, you know,
that can claim credit that can appear to
[SPEAKER_01]: be something unique?
[SPEAKER_01]: Filo's is where to look for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what's, what's related to what,
and some of the initial findings from
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago when they did their first runs
was that 80 to 85% of every hybrid out
[SPEAKER_01]: there had some marker of what I submitted,
um, in an, in an inherited sense.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you, do you think that's accurate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that, I mean, like that does seem
like a little high, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't surprise me for a number of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it wasn't, I mean, I, I entered the
seed market in the mid nineties,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you gotta remember I was doing clones
out to the public since 79.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know a lot of those went to Northern
California, Southern California,
[SPEAKER_01]: Southern Oregon, um, all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the seeds, I was giving seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at the time supplementing by dealing
whatever I had, uh, had a lot of foreign
[SPEAKER_01]: student, um, clientele who I will,
you know, Oh, Hey, can you give me some
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I would be doing R and D work and there
would be some seeds and whatever I was
[SPEAKER_01]: working with at the time that got passed
on to other people who would say,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, by the way, I sent that to my uncle in
Morocco or Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went off to Japan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a list one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was almost 60 countries.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, it wouldn't, wouldn't surprise me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, one thing I wanted to ask you was,
I, I have a feeling you would have to be
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the most ripped off slash,
you know, replicated breeders out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that, do you view that as a compliment
or is it more of like a challenge?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think for a long time,
a lot of people had issues getting,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, quote unquote, your seeds from
seed banks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then only to find out that like the
reality is they probably weren't your
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just gave me a new term, um,
complimentary challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I like to, you know, cap that off with
this and just say, Hey, the best is yet to
[SPEAKER_01]: come.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, let's focus on the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I just need my space, my time and to
be left alone and I'll do just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking forward to sharing that
with whomever appreciates it.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we might jump into some of the
fan submitted questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a good bunch here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll, um, we'll scroll down to one of the
ones I wanted to ask first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our good friend Bodhi wanted to know if
you could talk a little more about,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, your experience and opinions on using
psychedelics as a tool to assist with
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's just a general life rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for me, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People there's the concept of altering
consciousness, first of all, which is what
[SPEAKER_01]: makes the, the, our detractors nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what makes them uptight that we
alter our consciousness and somehow yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, have control over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's difficult for some people to,
to grasp at any rate, utilizing for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the, the concept of an altered
consciousness gives me what I like to
[SPEAKER_01]: refer to as a stereoscopic view of
reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my baseline state, how I perceive
life, anything challenge or obstacle,
[SPEAKER_01]: any decision I have to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have my altered state where I
can consider the same things and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: bounce back and forth between the two and
kind of get a little bit broader of a
[SPEAKER_01]: sense of, you know, at least what
opportunities exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so utilizing it as a tool,
um, uh, in that regard, it, it opens
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it puts me more in a place of where,
say someone in a schizophrenic state
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe, or in any state of disease or
distress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and how, how am I reacting to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I consume this herb, does it help the
situation or does it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: impede, make a little worse?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, make note of that because the herbs
that generally tend to calm in a
[SPEAKER_01]: psychedelic situation tend to bring that
in, in a baseline or non-psychedelic
[SPEAKER_01]: state, but cannabis is a mild psychedelic
in and of itself.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what are some of your preferred
psychedelics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, any, you know, all the indole range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Providing they're pure, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pure, um, for fungal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like things that are naturally
collected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if not, then naturally grown by
sincere people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and yeah, they all work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, one of the questions is what was
some of the original flavors, smells and
[SPEAKER_02]: structure of the ties that you're working
with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously you touched on this a little
before, but I think they're most
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in the flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what were the different flavor
expressions you were getting?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the land race tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the smell of the flower was just juicy
fruit, old school, tutti frutti,
[SPEAKER_01]: juicy fruit gum, sweet as can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tropical sharpness, uh, to it in the
smoke, it had the fruitiness kind of more
[SPEAKER_01]: of the mango.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would assume nursing, uh,
would have been in there, uh, piney sweet
[SPEAKER_01]: cedars, more woody, um, in the,
in the smoke, but the, it was just juicy
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very difficult to manicure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of had to just leave the bract
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: On and run them up the stem and sort of
squish them into a bag and hope that they,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they were more fermenting than
curing, but that finished product was
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and it had no ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, that stuff was dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really just so incredibly grateful to
have been able to try some highland tie
[SPEAKER_02]: that Bodhi grew out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that has got to be some of the
absolute best herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've ever had in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was easily the standout herb of the
last trip I did to the States.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was trying to describe it to a
friend and I was just like, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you're at a party and everyone's
having a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just feels like it felt so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, yeah, it's interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's, uh, very different to the super
racy tie, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you asked actually about the land
race.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just asked, answered about the P
ones I grew from the land race,
[SPEAKER_01]: the land race tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stick or the untied that stuff was
again, just so unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some of it, the curing process on the
stick involved fermenting, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: process that's used with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It involves water soaking and then
pressure and a very specific mold or yeast
[SPEAKER_01]: to the host plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be present and nothing else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it, it was like, it was like Thai
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet, savory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was just unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not, you know, the, the,
what I grew from it was close in a
[SPEAKER_01]: domestic sense, but nothing like what came
from Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that stuff was just, uh, amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, tropical fruit, Hawaiian punch only
was, you know, a bit of a fermentation to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, um, bringing, bringing some
memories.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a conversation with an old timer I
met not long ago and, and he lives,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, in Australia and he tries to grow
those ties you talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was talking about how he's trying
to replicate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, trying to get it as close
to Thailand as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, just as a little side note,
the biggest impactful thing he found was
[SPEAKER_02]: he put, um, heating mats under his pots
because he found that rooting the heat
[SPEAKER_02]: ball to like 25 degrees, like basically he
said, it would never really get colder
[SPEAKER_02]: than that in Thailand or where the seed
stock he was growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, it made a huge difference
phenotypically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, that's, that's food for
thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what little tricks I was just
reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something on the, on the Thai stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it was in the book Thai
stick, um, that the Thai people would let
[SPEAKER_01]: their babies, the infants sleep on the
bales.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there was a lot of things went on with
the Thai.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it had opium, um, in it,
which was just soaked in the water
[SPEAKER_01]: leftover from cooking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would heroin, uh, from the opium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, that, that, that was potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did not want to be out drinking and
smoke any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's almost like, wish I could have
tried some of that, but not at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the next question we have is that
iconic photo of you in the, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: the sports coat, holding the plan outside
in your younger days with the long hair.
[SPEAKER_02]: What year was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: 1979.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what plants that one in your hand,
that plant in my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you asked that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if you got a picture,
you can throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that is the chocolate tie and it is
seated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was, it's the name of that plant at
the time was patio door, because it was
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant that was right outside my patio
door in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't in a pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, yeah, that's chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's yeah, that's a real history photo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would definitely work one of those
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next question, which I think is a great
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember the first time you ever
hit that weed, whether, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever bong joint, whatever,
and you got that defined blueberry taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember that time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that would have been doing the F
twos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that would have been 1980 or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, back then it was, it was the
kind, it was just this old, my open,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was, it was a more of a dilator effect
than anything constrictive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the exact opposite of constrictive,
uh, which is, you know, kind of a,
[SPEAKER_01]: a fruit experience, you know, your,
your body takes it in, it's nourishing,
[SPEAKER_01]: it tastes good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it just has this appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just, just overall holistically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, I, I, not the, you know,
maybe the exact, the exact time in and
[SPEAKER_01]: around then, um, it was such a whirlwind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what I experienced in Oregon,
um, at that time coming from Detroit,
[SPEAKER_01]: just learning a pot grew there,
um, you know, how easily, um, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and how, uh, the quality compared to,
you know, getting the usual dirt weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: even B grade dirt weed or stumbling upon
some, some A grade now and again,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're lucky, um, but it,
it was, uh, quite the eye opener.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, new things were constant,
just constant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have several jars of things go,
Oh my God, it was, this is new and that is
[SPEAKER_01]: new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and always striving a little better
too, you know, making it, uh, better here
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and picking the next, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a little better than your mom and,
and going that route.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Striving to do better than I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another really interesting question we
got from our friend, True Cannibalist is
[SPEAKER_02]: he says that he read a while ago that you
liked, you know, maybe preferentially to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of smoke buds that had been
pollinated because you kind of enjoyed the
[SPEAKER_02]: changes that went on within the plant on
the biology level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you talk to us a little more about
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what kind of, is it you enjoy about
these seeded plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like do you find them to be more relaxing
or what is it for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Relaxing is, is a good way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, one, one of the aspects it's,
uh, uh, the term I like is broader.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a broader experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant has that seeded plant that was
able to complete its life cycle instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: being stuck before completing his life
cycle and then being harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's just something about that,
a maturity to the resins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and historically all of the great herb
that I've, I've mentioned came,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they were all hermaphroditic and
all at least somewhat seeded and all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the great hash came from field run,
uh, hash or hand rubbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was usually hermaphroditic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and seeded as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plus I've had, you know, I've had to
smoke a lot of seeded herb in my day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and the, the resins from,
from, from them as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can, you can tell there it's
subtle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's not a, you know, uh,
a real, uh, bold kind of difference,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's subtle and it's it is my
preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've touched on a lot of the topics this
question's asked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just going to kind of cut to the
one bit that's not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, do you have a preferred lighting
style?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you mentioned the CMHs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that, that's your preferred one for
indoor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, right now for having firsthand
experience with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, my son has been working with the
LEDs, uh, to great success and I'm reading
[SPEAKER_01]: great things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he's the company he works with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is next light out of Ohio and they're
really focusing on dialing in full
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the pictures I've been seeing,
people have been bringing in my classes
[SPEAKER_01]: and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my, my son's been showing me,
uh, bud sets, the canopy, the buds in the
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy are, um, albino.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, the plant just ceases producing so
much chlorophyll because it's saturated.
[SPEAKER_01]: With light, um, production is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpene quantity and quality is,
is very high because they tend not to
[SPEAKER_01]: dissipate so much with these cooler
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, the, um, uh, LEDs,
the high end LEDs are, are proving their
[SPEAKER_01]: merit and worth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm looking at getting some myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this next one, this question is an
interesting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of like the angle of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever tried any of what would
largely be considered hype strains like
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you thought to yourself, I don't mind
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I always try to be as positive as
possible, you know, and, and one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that people pride themselves on
that is kind of a hindrance to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a stumbling block is potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and, and it's not terribly difficult to
dial in and people do do it and they are
[SPEAKER_01]: proud of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I will, you know, it'll be my first
comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I am past something and I hit it and
it's a little overpowering, I say,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, that certainly is potent,
uh, which, you know, I guess satisfies
[SPEAKER_01]: their ego, uh, to some extent,
but, um, no, basically is the answer to
[SPEAKER_01]: your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I, I, I avoid, uh, it's,
it's hard for me anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I judge cups now and again,
but the only thing I'm judging are like,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, resins, live resins and, and,
uh, solvent lists and, and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the rosin, um, I, it's pretty easy
to, uh, deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can titrate, just do a little tiny
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can decide I like that or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I don't have to go there,
but what I'm trying to avoid are these,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, got another two hours out of my
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll never get back like a bad movie,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've had enough of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a question I wish I came up
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you noticed any negatives throughout
the course of inbreeding your lines in any
[SPEAKER_02]: of them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, vigor is still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, considering that, you know,
in terms of commercial offerings,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working with F4s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's, it's still completely interests
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, and, and there are things,
like I said, things I've lost,
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that when I sprout a certain
number of seeds, especially from a batch I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't sprouted before, I'm going to see
something new, uh, both positive and
[SPEAKER_01]: negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes there's negative in there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, well, that raises a good
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you frequently find there's a few duds
in each project or, you know, is that,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, or is that like, and how often do
you completely shelve something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The keepers are, you know, um,
a small percentage really when,
[SPEAKER_01]: when doing R and D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, certain lines, like, well,
his happy pussy line presented a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: stellar females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I sent some to my son to find a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave him seven seeds and the end of
seven females, um, which, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that went that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, um, I think you almost referenced
earlier on where, you know, you'd be
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at F8, F10 before you'd really be
in breeding hard, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, uh, I can go to any level,
you know, if I get bored, I can sprout an
[SPEAKER_01]: F3 and, and, and look there and,
and see, because then there's branches,
[SPEAKER_01]: other branches can come off of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, whereas when I'm working with F4s,
it's, it's kind of more set things are
[SPEAKER_01]: more, um, defined.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So would you ever consider working any
feminized gear?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, making your own feminized
lines?
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought about it with Flo, simply
because she's never sported one male
[SPEAKER_01]: flower in all the 27 years she's been
alive, stressed many times near death and
[SPEAKER_01]: never shown male flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I let my son, I said, here,
why don't give it a whirl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he got male flowers present,
I think some pollen, but we did not get
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that project was mainly
just for preservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but no, again, I don't have time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I have too many other things
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Filial crosses are going to keep me busy
and everybody happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll let other people do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one, I'm not sure, you know,
really the background on it, but it says,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, is it true that there was an original
blueberry and it was lost?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not lost per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I gave you the story about the
fellow that showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so yeah, it was out of my hands,
but many, she's thousands of those were
[SPEAKER_01]: sent out to many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's, it's, I'm pretty sure it's
still out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could come up with it again as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just waiting for the, like I said,
space and time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you ever smoke miles and is it true
that you want to smoke miles while on
[SPEAKER_02]: acid?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bit of a ridiculous question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So smoked what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoked like male pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, male, male, male, male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well back in days of desperation,
I remember trying stems once.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember trying pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pollen once.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like smoking hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, with no merit, with no benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, now as far as smoking males to
determine, uh, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take the very tips that are,
are flowering, uh, enough of them to make
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, uh, used to be in a bowl or a
joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I found the, uh, volcano vaporizer,
uh, worked great for if there are,
[SPEAKER_01]: if there is a terpene presence in that
male that you can sense it more,
[SPEAKER_01]: more readily with the volcano vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a really good tip actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been a little bit of like a
discussion around males that
[SPEAKER_02]: hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you were one of the initial people
who kind of put a bit of a statement out
[SPEAKER_02]: there saying you didn't mind them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, I've toyed around with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Myself and I know other people who have
toyed around with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's kind of been a bit of mixed
results.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what's kind of your, you know,
opinion on the subject, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can get a proper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call them backwards males.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I think the reason that I have
encountered them and been able to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with them is because whatever plant it was
before I knew it's sex was very
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was sporting some fluorescence to it
that it was, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, turns out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out to be a male and I would
think, okay, I'm going to set you aside,
[SPEAKER_01]: see how you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to use you as a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, like it put out one
set or two set of male flowers and went
[SPEAKER_01]: totally female after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that plant also, um, turned out to,
Oh, it was sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was completely sterile and sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit it with three different males.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because she was really stellar and
terribly difficult to clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't think I cloned her.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I went to read greener and I had
to let her go because of space and time
[SPEAKER_01]: constraints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, she was, uh, male first then
strictly female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but I've seen them at other times and
it's a phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, again, I don't know maybe if this is
related to the culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if this is related to the
culture scene as well, or not where they
[SPEAKER_01]: put out, uh, pre flowers or their first
sex, uh, is one and they flip to the
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't had a problem, um,
with those using those as, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, females for flower, but not for,
for breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one comment I read a lot on the
internet and I wanted to get your opinion
[SPEAKER_02]: on it was that people seem to think that
the kind of current offering of
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberries are like a sweet, uh,
you know, like kind of what I think of
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they say that the earlier
versions was more of like a blueberry
[SPEAKER_02]: muffin type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think that's maybe just a bit of
like, you know, reminiscent looking back
[SPEAKER_02]: and thinking it was a little different to
what it was?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think two phenomenon or play there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of which is that pre 98 phenomenon
where I had released a quite broad
[SPEAKER_01]: variance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that someone may have stumbled
upon what they referred to as a blueberry
[SPEAKER_01]: muffin phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other side of it, I think has to
do with, uh, additives, fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_01]: various nutrients are altering the flavor
of herb light frequencies as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having my best luck again with the
blue range, uh, ceramic metal highlights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the LEDs also are bringing out the
sweet goodness and a lot more flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, you know, one of those two
factors are both of them working together
[SPEAKER_01]: have built that, um, legend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I think a lot of people would go
into hybrids trying to create the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the fabled blueberry muffin terpene
profile, which is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's, it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I run across it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what people are talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was more prompt, uh, in the
eighties, late eighties, early nineties,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, get much different additive,
uh, available back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's simpler on the topic of additives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever heard of, um, people
spraying, you know, blueberry with like
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the actual blueberry spray additives?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that's don't, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, juice, blueberry juice,
any, any colored thing, the roots will
[SPEAKER_01]: take it up and.
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly transfer it up to the flowers,
but yeah, I just remember this one time I
[SPEAKER_02]: had this banana OG and it was almost too
banana to be real.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in retrospect, I have a feeling
that's exactly what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, anyway, this is another really good
question from the one of our listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, have you ever had like a mistake or a
learning lesson during a breeding project
[SPEAKER_02]: that you've really, you know, taken with
you and it's was a good experience
[SPEAKER_02]: overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when I was shooting for high potency
and, um, fast flowering, I went three
[SPEAKER_01]: generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was increasing with each, but on that
third one, I ran into like 75% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow was this thing called, I called no
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was actually worse than no high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called it grumpy dope because it,
it had the opposite effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like anti pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it was a terrible stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, unfortunately, I had a funny story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sold it to a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a bass player in a reggae band.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't test it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had let it go to him this one
evening and it was like eight 30 in the
[SPEAKER_01]: morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a banging on the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my door and what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, Oh God, Walter and Walter was
pissed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walter never got pissed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Walter was never up at eight 30 in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, what's wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's what's this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sold me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I invited him in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sat down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a bong hit over and I said,
Jesus, dude, I apologized right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got him something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: We smoked that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took it right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, and, uh, another friend of mine,
he just, I ended up passing it onto him
[SPEAKER_01]: and he did, uh, an experiment kind of a
rude experiment at the Oregon country fair
[SPEAKER_01]: where he bagged a bunch of that up and
then just left it in places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he watched people and he said,
they did, they started fighting and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: a terrible, um, so I said, okay,
be careful and make sure you test
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, you know, to make what you're
putting out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be, you've got to know that it
performs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so this question, yeah, really
intrigued me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, uh, I've heard a rumor that only
around 20 to 30% of the work, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in your library has actually ever seen
daylight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, somewhere I would say 40 to 60% in
that range or it has seen, has seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, 60 to 40% hasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you weren't kidding when the best
is yet to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I released what I've released.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've been sitting on my thumbs for
so long here waiting for this decades now,
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing this time was coming and just kind
of going, Oh God, making sure everything
[SPEAKER_01]: is safe and scattered to the four winds
and in trustworthy hands and just waiting
[SPEAKER_01]: and waiting for the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: But realistically, it's going to be when
we have worldwide importation,
[SPEAKER_01]: then, you know, maybe resurrect some of
these genetics back in their sweet spots,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this great article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on IC mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a guy named red rider was the
poster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was Johnny blaze, which was one of
our Canadian offerings was the Neville's
[SPEAKER_01]: haze hit with that B 133 blueberry dad up
there grown in Santa Marta, Columbia at
[SPEAKER_01]: 10,000 feet elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the locals, they were posting in the,
in the grow and smoke reports that the
[SPEAKER_01]: locals were going, she's back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were referring to Punta Roya,
uh, the purple tip, uh, gold pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, you know, this is not just
domestically, it's all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, uh, again, in our area focus on
concentrates and resins and these
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful terpenes and isolating them and
breeding for those types of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, when the day comes, we've got
worldwide importation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then people will know, you know,
good herb on a, on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you have any tips for our listeners
about how you go about selecting your
[SPEAKER_02]: males?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's no shortcuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to pollinate the female,
mature the seed, cure it, sprout it and
[SPEAKER_01]: grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, to be sure hollow stems is an
indication of, you know, there's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be some potency drug cannabis,
same with, um, uh, resin content.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he's, if he's got any potency to him
whatsoever, he'll more than likely carry
[SPEAKER_01]: that on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's his terpene profile?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, those, those types of things to look
for the stem rub, rubbing the leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: smelling that if you have five of them
next to each other, which one is the most
[SPEAKER_01]: appealing in that regard?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, those, those, those basic
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the one I would lean toward in
terms of using if, you know, if space is
[SPEAKER_01]: an issue, numbers are an issue,
which they are for some people still.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what, uh, some of the things which go
through your mind when you're thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: about starting a new cross, do you kind of
really plan things out or you just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: more experiment it first?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's, it's pretty much experimental.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have things, uh, kind of on deck that
it's going to be one of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and yeah, there's a priority,
uh, kind of set to, to looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: various, various things right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still in the resurrection stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things that have been stumbled upon
and released and, and refinding them and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting them secured and stable somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then going on from there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one listener wants to know if you could
give us your opinion on where the
[SPEAKER_02]: autoflower trait originates from,
especially given it was in, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't know until the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of avoided it in the work I've been
doing just simply because it tended to
[SPEAKER_01]: have more hermaphroditic characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the market, I'm satisfying with
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to low hermaphrodite or,
or, or none.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's relatively simple to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just two, two, three generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't tolerate it in your parents'
stock and it tends to go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I am curious now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of people leaning that way and
I do have memories of using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if that helps her answers,
but yeah, no, that does.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are our last little quick fire
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pretty, you know, yes,
no type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So out of everything you've ever had,
what's your favorite strain of all time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, hash Nepalese temple ball right up
there with the cash Mary Charis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of hash, um, in terms of herb,
the Highland Oaxacan and the Highland
[SPEAKER_01]: Thai, probably I liked the Highland
Oaxacan a little better than the Thai.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Thai had a good potency, but the
Oaxacan had a pleasantness about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As did the Santa Marta, the Colombian
gold, the Acapulco golds, all of those,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, frankincense, cedar leaning,
uh, gold, South and Central Americans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were probably my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thai was right up there with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what is your least favorite strain
or just the one that's vibed with you
[SPEAKER_02]: least?
[SPEAKER_01]: God, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ruderalis hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, speaking of which driving across
country, man, just so you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I took interstate 80.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of feral hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking August, early August,
and they were big plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cornfields, it was Indiana,
Illinois, Iowa, um, and then into west or
[SPEAKER_01]: Eastern Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the sides of the cornfields along
the highway, this was kind of strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, you know, I've heard rumor that
they're back, but I know that the highway
[SPEAKER_01]: patrol generally was yanking those things
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but there were a lot of the big plants
with big leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're traveling interstate 80,
up in that area, be on the lookout for
[SPEAKER_01]: some, uh, nice looking hemp plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never thought I'd really see the
roadside hemp like the, uh, the old seed
[SPEAKER_02]: mags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I didn't either, but there it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to keep doing a double take and
it sure enough was big leaf hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So final question for this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your hopes for the future of the
cannabis scene?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, just, you know, borrowing from the
dead and the brotherhood managed to share
[SPEAKER_01]: the love, you know, that's, that's,
that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we can heal his planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're healing cancer, curing cancer for
God's sake.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you need some more serious than
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we're, we're finally stepping out of
these, you know, if there's still people a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand years away, a thousand years from
now, they're going to include,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to include up to this point
in time in the dark ages.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're almost there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the dawning of the information age is
about to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think all information once it
becomes apparent and available,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll work it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll work it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So did you have any comments or shout outs
you wanted to make before we wrap it up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no, just, uh, hello and thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: To my lovely partner, Dawn Ann,
cured her cancer with cannabis or breast
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and is now four and a half years
cancer free.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had the checkup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and just, Hey, you know, to the plant
always for the plague.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep her, keep her green, keep her
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
