[SPEAKER_00]: You know why you're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bee man himself is here to drop some
knowledge bombs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not delay it any further.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're so grateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys waited so patiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without further delay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are like some of your favourite
strains that you enjoy the effect or the
[SPEAKER_00]: high of the most?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for my own strains, like,
you know, Goji has always been like had a
[SPEAKER_02]: special place in my heart that,
you know, it kind of was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it just all came together in such a
special way and created, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it always just made me happy and always
kind of had a kind of like a heart feeling
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was up just enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that it kept you like you could go out
to, you know, see music or you could go on
[SPEAKER_02]: a hike or it just it just has it's just
kind of that pinnacle of like good vibe
[SPEAKER_02]: herb that I loved.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really love Dreadbread a lot because
it's it has a really great up high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like a sativa, but it has
enough bottom end that you feel like you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, when your body feels really good and
your mind feels good at the same time,
[SPEAKER_02]: it makes you kind of want to stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a good kind of yoga herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like some of the DLA's are fun
because they have different effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people really like those kind of
like everything from four and up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what else I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I used to like tranquil
elementizer was a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that for just relaxing,
like if I just had to go for just super
[SPEAKER_02]: like glue you to the couch.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some other good ones?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all the black triangle,
I really like the effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was really nice and potent,
but really it kind of like life affirming,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you know, there's there's some
strange you smoke and they're either too
[SPEAKER_02]: strong or they're they just tend to or
they're kind of like scary, not scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say like, have you ever had a
strain that's kind of like clinical?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's very, like rough around the
edges and just kind of like, like kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like more if it had a element,
it would like be the metal element.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you could rate cannabis and like
emotive and then wood would be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, wood would be like,
I guess grounded and rooted and then air
[SPEAKER_02]: would be like, like airy kind of sativa
and ether would be like the electric
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa and then metal would be kind of
like this is very clinical, like in the
[SPEAKER_02]: mind, like make you kind of think,
but they don't have a lot necessarily so
[SPEAKER_02]: much joy like the Mexican destiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I, that was a cool one,
but it was very clinical.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made you kind of think about things,
but it wasn't super joyful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, okay, let's just it was like
a therapist, like, okay, let's do some
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, if I could write them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's but yeah, I like Baba Shah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunshine Daydream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just love the feeling like it is like
you get the right female and it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: like, welcome to like, to pleasure town
just enjoy a movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like all the OG eight G 13s always
created really cool, cool plants with cool
[SPEAKER_02]: highs like they that male was really
amazing that it could it just harmonize
[SPEAKER_02]: with certain varieties, you know,
and some of the ones like uplift is a
[SPEAKER_02]: really cool version of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them were a little bit heavy,
but some of them got got kind of I just
[SPEAKER_02]: love those like joyful, heady highs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think well, I like some wookie stuff,
the Congo cashmere I really love.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a supernatural selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like some of the Congo cashmere
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, the wookie stuff is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It always had unique things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like killer orgasm is a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes you kind of feel like a kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's more and that's an
unreleased one.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, there's so many cool I'm trying to
think of all the different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just been so it's been a,
you know, it's been I think I've released
[SPEAKER_02]: like hundreds of strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been like a 20 year catalog.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, but the ones that have kind
of lasted, even ones that don't haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: existed for 10 years and last the kind of
test of time like goji sunshine daydream.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're ones like Black Triangle
and Congo cashmere dread bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to like some of the new medicine
mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like I like TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else cool once I made one called
Dharma bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the TV cross to the Big Sur Nigerian.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, those
[SPEAKER_02]: kids off in the ring isn't pulling because
I doubt and I'll stay up all night if I
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems unless it's a super downer like
Narco Bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's that's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I mean, yeah, it sounds like a
double edged blade in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you just mentioned TV, a good buddy
of mine, Eli Cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a breeder in Australia here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a seed company called Local
Birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He definitely recommend people check it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's done some breeding work utilizing a
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: He found out of the TV seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, I'm really keen to crack into
some of those myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd love to ask you what sort of some
stuff you feel that strain brings to the
[SPEAKER_00]: table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's got some heavy,
heavyweights in the lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me a bit about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, for the first kind of
medicine man was all about kind of making
[SPEAKER_02]: approachable like narrow leaves or sativas
or like or like more super energetic,
[SPEAKER_02]: heady highs, like making it so people
could actually grow them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So TV was I kind of like the flagship that
I was going to make hybrids with a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: things and also kind of as an ode to it,
release it to so that everybody can have
[SPEAKER_02]: the parents for the for TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for the first release and kind of
like you can make your own stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, TV is like the Vietnamese
seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make it a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: To grow, you know, and and so I took an
effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked the Charlie's Destroyer for a
couple generations, and I used a really
[SPEAKER_02]: quicker kind of like stout, really
resilient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he was really good at creating stuff
that that was workable, like that it would
[SPEAKER_02]: do what it says.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if, you know, he could his magic was
kind of making things that were grower
[SPEAKER_02]: friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I found a really nice kind of
faster finishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a pearl tie dominant destroyer
destroyers like I think it was a northern
[SPEAKER_02]: lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mostly taught tie with some what he
brings that northern lights, Nepali or
[SPEAKER_02]: northern lights, something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a very manageable kind of tie,
very strong tie dominant tie line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So TV is like I always call it like
totally visionary or tie Vietnamese.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like it's like someone's
always wanted to grow a tie, but can't
[SPEAKER_02]: really grow it in their tent or grow it
outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's it's you can finish it and you
can grow it and it makes good hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of the the reason why I
created that is the first one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, there was a special
one, like a gift one that went out just to
[SPEAKER_02]: friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called Dharma Bum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the TV Big Sur Nigerian.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there was Zap and a few others.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's going to be more to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I find, you know, it's when you're
looking for like snareleaf and heirloom
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa and stuff like that, you got to go
through a lot to kind of find truly
[SPEAKER_02]: exceptional ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have to make sure they out
cross well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually, you know, if they're usually
distinct enough, you get that hybrid vigor
[SPEAKER_02]: and you get, you know, nature loves new
things coming together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It applauds that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's the magic of life on
Earth is is bringing diverse elements
[SPEAKER_02]: together to create new things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think any time that you take like
so-called land-based plants and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: bound to find something that's most likely
better than the parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's kind of what Medicine
Mountain's about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's incredible to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of people wanted to know,
are there any plans for future releases
[SPEAKER_00]: from Medicine Mountain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just they probably won't be
ready until next the end of next season,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it is it's like, you know,
flowering males out for nine weeks just to
[SPEAKER_02]: get pollen is not the most exciting thing
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's why I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Supernatural selections is so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because, you know, they're usually F1
hybrids between narrow leaf and broad
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so collect the pollen from the broad
leaf earlier and just flower out your your
[SPEAKER_02]: sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's easier to make hybrids that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Medicine Mountain is a labor of
love when you have to grow things that
[SPEAKER_02]: are, you know, too to see reading is not
necessarily the easiest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does take quite a lot of time,
but it's worth it in the end for that,
[SPEAKER_02]: what you can achieve and what you can
make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a cool little point you raised
about, you know, getting the pollen from
[SPEAKER_00]: the broad leaves earlier in the season out
of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, based on what you've
already told us, the answer is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: no.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess have you had a chance or are
you maybe more thinking about exploring
[SPEAKER_00]: any of the populations of stuff we've seen
via Deepak and the other land race crew?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they've certainly been posting
some pretty tantalizing purple buds
[SPEAKER_00]: recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they have incredible stuff like,
yeah, he we usually trade a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, he sent me some like pretty
much everything that they release.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's so much to go through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm loving a lot of these Afghani
collections like the Maroof.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many different cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just haven't had a space like I
would go berserk if I was still at the old
[SPEAKER_02]: farm like I would have been I would have
blown through those already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I love growing broadleafs because
they're just so they're in unless you live
[SPEAKER_02]: in a high mold pressure environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like little cousin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like they're so easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just they're so smelly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're so I don't know, they're like
gnomes or garden gnomes, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're just so fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they usually they are they you can
trace them back pretty close to the
[SPEAKER_02]: source.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I think and they have such
unique and special highs, it's just having
[SPEAKER_02]: a breeding program or having a long term
line breeding program where you can kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of bring them out of their, you know,
they have horrible morphology for
[SPEAKER_02]: trimming, because basically they're hash
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't always like kind of register
that but most of these broadleafs they're
[SPEAKER_02]: not designed to make beautiful buds in the
bag, they're made for their resin heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but I would love to you know,
it'd be really cool is if someone in the
[SPEAKER_02]: States came up with a like a heirloom
broadleaf hash repository like where they
[SPEAKER_02]: just grew broadleafs point of origin
broadleafs and then hashed them and then
[SPEAKER_02]: could offer traditionally processed,
you know, you're not going to see too much
[SPEAKER_02]: African Afghan stamp bricks here in the
United States for a while until we go
[SPEAKER_02]: globally legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But until then, imagine taking those
things and finding maybe like a high dose
[SPEAKER_02]: of their environment, just growing like
1000 heirloom broadleafs and then just
[SPEAKER_02]: hashing them out like how cool I would
love to go pick some of that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sign me up like I'm sure there's got to be
a market.
[SPEAKER_02]: People would love that all even old timers
I used to get the the red stamped you know
[SPEAKER_02]: what Afghani King of Afghanistan ones are
the I got red Lebanese from an old lady
[SPEAKER_02]: that lived down the block who got it from
a boat captain hairdresser that picked it
[SPEAKER_02]: up in the Khyber pass when she was hunting
for, you know, Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wish there was a market for I wish
there was a way that people could follow
[SPEAKER_02]: their bliss and follow their niche and
really enjoy what they're doing again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many people in cannabis these days are
just worn out and sad and disenchanted and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's hard to keep a family when
you can't feed your family.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to have that joy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's hard to go that and it's so
sad that that's been sucked out of it
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can see it even the seed
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I mean, there's an immense amount
of new seed companies and so many people
[SPEAKER_02]: doing fantastic things and boring things
and great things and special things and
[SPEAKER_02]: and it but there's also a lot of the old
timers that are having to kind of find new
[SPEAKER_02]: go back to their old jobs or find are
just, you know, it's not a full time job
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just their kind of passion side
project, you know, because things are
[SPEAKER_02]: hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that'd be the beautiful thing
about descheduling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine if you can make seeds and sell to
the entire country of the whole world.
[SPEAKER_02]: You open it up so much more that you could
actually kind of cover your bills because
[SPEAKER_02]: you have a lot more people that can grow
your seeds and that demographic would be
[SPEAKER_02]: there like, you know, I'm hoping that
someday we go federal legal and I think
[SPEAKER_02]: that would really open it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many people that are stigmatized
because they feel it's a illegal plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if that was released, imagine all
those people that just love to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers or anything, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's that's how I stay positive is
just hoping that one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: When things do go federal legal,
there won't be a way to stop it and
[SPEAKER_02]: people's curiosity and the stories they
tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, kind of like how
legalization was brought in kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: through the Charlotte's Web, like kids
needing epilepsy care like that was kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of the way in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like once it's opened, it can't be
put back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's going to be the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like once people realize the
person that's not a drug, it's basically
[SPEAKER_02]: the one it's a wonder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is a wonder generator for life on
Earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if anybody that's having that's never
smoked it, you know, you see those YouTube
[SPEAKER_02]: videos sometimes of like first time
grandpa smokes pot and like their world
[SPEAKER_02]: just opens up like where was the stuff my
whole life?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, it's such it's been with
us forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the Dogon feel that,
you know, they come from the Sirius A and
[SPEAKER_02]: B, the star system and the beings that
came from that place and came to visit
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They brought cannabis as a gift to have
better lives and to have happy times here
[SPEAKER_02]: on Earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's a gift.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gift from source.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gift.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gift from the heart of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's our most it's basically our our
prime botanical ally on this Earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It provides everything we could possibly
need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's an absolute crime and shame that
we're in this place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're in this place of
pseudo-legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not legalized.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just regulated so people can make
money off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's totally not legalized.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's even worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I think things were much better in
when it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, or even or the best times we
ever had was 215, where it was like this
[SPEAKER_02]: pseudo pseudo-legality where people could
still follow their heart and sell what
[SPEAKER_02]: they made.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like that was a time of great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think if we would have had 215,
we would have ushered right into the time
[SPEAKER_02]: we have now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd be even more up the creek because
there would be such it would be such now
[SPEAKER_02]: just be a wasteland.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that'd probably be almost a
unanimous thing in our entire community
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, 215 was clearly superior
to to what we have now and the prospect of
[SPEAKER_00]: what we have going forward, which is
really sort of a bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look, I've thought about this a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of things that are
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as an individual, it's hard to give
advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've thought long about, like,
you know, what can you tell someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: struggling to pay their bills and stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing I've always thought is
kind of like taking tibets of what we've
[SPEAKER_00]: spoken about already is that most of the
new stuff comes from passionate hobby
[SPEAKER_00]: people, not big facilities, and maybe one
silver lining of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I don't want to call it a
silver lining because anyone who's forced
[SPEAKER_00]: out of, say, being a full time grower and
having to pick up some other work,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I don't want to try to,
you know, minimize that or say,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, a silver lining, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing that might be a result of
that is that you now have more freedom
[SPEAKER_00]: over what you grow, you know, because your
income isn't solely maybe coming from this
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that freedom, you could maybe use
that to explore some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who knows, you know, you might end up
finding the new big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly that's got more of a chance
of success than, you know, just growing
[SPEAKER_00]: the same OG clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, the only thing you're
going to be able to do at the end of that
[SPEAKER_00]: is sell the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's no prospect of making
something new out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your advice?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the small time grower or how can
people try to positively contribute to
[SPEAKER_00]: push the scene in the right direction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just grow interesting, unique stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think it's follow your bliss and
find your niche and like, and also find
[SPEAKER_02]: your community, find people around you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, you know, you may not be able to
grow a lot of plants, but if you have five
[SPEAKER_02]: people that are passionate about it,
that you've met online or at local meetups
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever, you have five times the
amount to try your five new buddy to be
[SPEAKER_02]: creative with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I think it's all about growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like finding new things, but clones are
awesome, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love growing to see what like it like,
that's really fun to see what like the new
[SPEAKER_02]: thing that everybody's into, because it
really allows it gives you a benchmark on
[SPEAKER_02]: where not only where we're at,
but where we want to be like if this is
[SPEAKER_02]: the most ultimate thing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, Oh, wow, this is
incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how was this made?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what is it made from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you could be like, Oh, that's not that
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, this is actually way cooler than,
you know, check this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's all about growing as,
as much unique things as you can,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also finding those if something really
speaks to you and speaks to your heart and
[SPEAKER_02]: to your, your physiology and your biology
or endocannabinoid system, there's someone
[SPEAKER_02]: out there, there's actually probably quite
a few people out there that are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have that same vibe with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take a few generations really mold it
like a piece of art, like a sculpture into
[SPEAKER_02]: what you want it to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it it's, that's the amazing thing
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this unending journey, we can all
work on it together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has so many ways to express itself
in on every level from from, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: even people like that are depressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I mean, sometimes people will
mask depression with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, like I said before,
cannabis is a wonder generator,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it really allows you to tune into the
wonder of the world, like, no wonder
[SPEAKER_02]: people love to watch movies or play video
games, because it enhances all of our
[SPEAKER_02]: senses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our senses are what allow us to
experience the world, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and people with all this, everybody
getting locked to their phones and all the
[SPEAKER_02]: new talk of AI, like, go to the original
AI, the ancient intelligence, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: go back to the world, this this incredible
thing, it's like, cannabis is nature's Wi
[SPEAKER_02]: Fi, like, you know, this, it's the signal
might not be there, but the perception is
[SPEAKER_02]: way better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you need to go, it's like,
it allows you to embody yourself on earth
[SPEAKER_02]: and to really see what's real as we get
swept away into this artificial world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the only things that's backing
us back backing us back to like this
[SPEAKER_02]: garden reality of like, you know,
I always laugh when they always say like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cannabis, it's a gateway drug to
gardening, you know, I always think of all
[SPEAKER_02]: these homeboys, like during the og craze,
I'm like, okay, so now they're just
[SPEAKER_02]: playing video games and smoking og,
and they're all growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: God's like, how amazing that it's like a
feminine, they get to like experience the
[SPEAKER_02]: feminine, you know, growing female plants,
like it, it's such amazing things,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's created so many unique
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel sad when people can't
experience that it would be like going
[SPEAKER_02]: through life not making love or something,
you know, like, you know, virgin all your
[SPEAKER_02]: life for being a virgin to plant medicine
is just as sad, you know, if you've never
[SPEAKER_02]: that I encourage everyone, you know,
to do all the plant medicines that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: experience ethically, especially hoping
that you create them yourself is the even
[SPEAKER_02]: thing if you can grow mushrooms,
it's so easy, like, and grow them yourself
[SPEAKER_02]: and put in your love and you're like,
you know, playing music, do whatever you
[SPEAKER_02]: want, put your vibe into them,
they're going to give you back what you
[SPEAKER_02]: put back into them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same with ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel I just you know, it's just the
same that we people don't have the
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if they do have the opportunity,
they get schwack, you know, they get
[SPEAKER_02]: booth, they get, they just get junk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wish there was a way that people
that have loved for it and have been doing
[SPEAKER_02]: it and really know how to do it and create
something have the ability to offer that
[SPEAKER_02]: and be compensated for that so that they
can move forward, you know, and also make
[SPEAKER_02]: it a family business like this should be
it should be multi generational,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can't just leave, you know,
lose all of these lineages of ganja people
[SPEAKER_02]: that go back at your time, you know,
it's not fair to the world or to society.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, look, it's it is terrible to think
about how much potential knowledge could
[SPEAKER_00]: be lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, hopeful that there's a break
soon and some sort of reform that allows
[SPEAKER_00]: these people to continue on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when you were just talking
then about encouraging just plant medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption of all kinds, I couldn't help
but think back to in the original episode
[SPEAKER_00]: when you were talking about, we were
talking about blending.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco with cannabis and you were
describing tobacco as a bit like a saddle
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're riding a horse and it allows
you to go different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not have otherwise been able to
have gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've definitely actually been indulging
that a little bit over the years,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, despite the fact I don't really
consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't consume tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do once in a blue moon, maybe probably
not even once every six months,
[SPEAKER_00]: but definitely more than once a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will consume some tobacco with it and
it's so profoundly different to what I
[SPEAKER_00]: remember when I used to just consistently
consume tobacco with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really resonated with what you
said, you know, it was a very different
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, it actually made anything I was
smoking like a sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciated that, you know,
obviously people get stimulated off
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco, but I very much was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got me thinking about, you know,
like the ways in which you consume it and
[SPEAKER_00]: the ways it changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes your appreciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as time's gone by, I've sort of been
consuming less and less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had one of the listeners ask and it
sort of ties in with what I'm getting at
[SPEAKER_00]: here, which is has your way you consume
cannabis changed your relationship with
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think for me, at least it's been
almost quite paradoxical in that the less
[SPEAKER_00]: I consume to a certain extent,
I still consume a decent amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost more meaningful in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I haven't articulated it that well,
but I'd love to hear your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how is your view on and your
relationship with it changed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I definitely slowed down,
but it's more because I have to be more
[SPEAKER_02]: responsible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not that I can't be responsible
on campus cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that cannabis turns me into like a
kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm so hypersensitive to plant,
plant spirit medicines or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm extraordinarily sensitive to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love that I cultivate that because
then I can really feel the nuances and I
[SPEAKER_02]: can really kind of I can connect with them
in a deeper way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of try and bring it in on a daily
just as a something that walks with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I don't know, the older you
get, either you do it a lot more or you
[SPEAKER_02]: start to find a balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I respect all the people that can
turn it on and leave it on that can smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: all day and I and it and it's like coffee
or it's like anything that kind of allows
[SPEAKER_02]: them to move through their experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there's something special and
also reaching kind of a sensitive place
[SPEAKER_02]: with it where it's you're using it more as
a therapeutic experience or you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're creating an enjoyable experience is
trying to instead of masking things you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't like about the world using it or in
your own body or your own mind,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're using it to experience greater
levels of complexity and joy and everyday
[SPEAKER_02]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've definitely I would love I used to,
you know, smoke every day and I would
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke usually at night after things calm
down and I would take my notes because I
[SPEAKER_02]: had just, you know, 100 different plants
hanging in the garage and really kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's when I do do it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I need it's like an old friend,
you know, you're like, Oh, wow,
[SPEAKER_02]: why am I not doing this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like every moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we were talking before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, for me, when my mind opens,
my mouth closes, like I'm not I find I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: in such a wonder place that it's hard for
me to interact with people that are in
[SPEAKER_02]: that same space.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do you ever get like you ever
gone out to like, like the supermarket
[SPEAKER_02]: stoned and it's just like going to another
planet and you just realized I am I'm like
[SPEAKER_02]: way too high to be in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like you're at a crux there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either you freak out and get paranoid or
you just have the kind of the time of your
[SPEAKER_02]: life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you kind of need a sitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I remember I used to love to get
blazed and go to the movies.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I always need someone to like,
like I was a kid, like someone to hold my
[SPEAKER_02]: hand so I didn't do anything too weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I think it's just finding your
own balance with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people smoke incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incredible amounts and do incredible
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people just smoke it once in a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like we're going back to that same
thing of just finding finding your how you
[SPEAKER_02]: walk with it, finding your balance,
finding just the right interaction that
[SPEAKER_02]: enriches your life and doesn't take away
from it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing I often reflect on is that
at every stage of my life, I have
[SPEAKER_00]: reflected on my consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it always felt like it was sort of
optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, it's interesting to
acknowledge that when I was younger and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking more like that probably was
better, you know, probably was better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't smoking as little as I am now
because maybe I was a bit more anxious
[SPEAKER_00]: back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you said, it just ties back into
finding where your own sort of sweet spot
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm definitely a big fan of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to jump to an interesting little
side point, which was that over the years,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've certainly got many, many messages
from people who point out that you were
[SPEAKER_00]: the first guest to essentially talk about
hoplite and virus on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in the first episode,
you were talking about dudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was episode 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very fitting episode 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you were actually the first person to
mention it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we were talking about Calio at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, HPLV has just evolved into
its own huge issue since the seven years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we've almost gotten to a point
now where it's very much out of sight,
[SPEAKER_00]: out of mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still there, but I think people are
just sort of letting their guard down a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on it and how has it
affected you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the beautiful thing about being
involved with Hayes Valley is they,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they do all the testing and it's
really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and they're really allowing me to
see like, oh, this is these are signs.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I've learned so much about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, sometimes you can't you
don't even notice it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some strains that just grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll grow past it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still in the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still an endemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really seems to kind of arise when
the plant gets stressed or it's in
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions that it doesn't really do well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you get these big facilities that
are really good at pumping out flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have just the right light,
just the right, you know, nutrient system,
[SPEAKER_02]: just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not showing up, but it's still in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, I remember heard recently
that, you know, they're saying now that it
[SPEAKER_02]: can be, it could go into seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, yeah, I get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may be that mom, because the seeds are
coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're coming out of infected mom,
but if the dad, how is the pollen carrying
[SPEAKER_02]: HPL and pollinating a new mother and
that's getting seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just baffles me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, science is I'm not a
scientist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an artist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I think that you could go
either way and cannabis and some people
[SPEAKER_02]: can do both at the same time, which it's
not, I mean, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the easiest, but yeah,
it's a, that's a rough one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I've seen it just destroy,
destroy people's gardens and destroy,
[SPEAKER_02]: just take out clones and, and take out
clones that, you know, disappear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we used to trade a lot back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it'd be like, sometimes you
get a call like six months later,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, do you still have the puck or do you
have this or that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, Oh no, I don't know what
happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: That thing just kind of like, it just
croaked or it got, you know, you got
[SPEAKER_02]: something, you know, something,
the roots, like no one really knew back
[SPEAKER_02]: then it was that, you know, what dudding
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was usually, Oh, the plants just
old or it's been cloned too many times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got to wonder where, where it came
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, now it's in everybody's gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have everybody trading and you have
these clone depots that I'm sure not
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody's testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is one where plant pathology
is just not my strong suit, but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's got to, it's a viral,
there's got to be, it's got to have
[SPEAKER_02]: happened in other species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they have antivirals that they give
plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like, how, how do we, how do we
get out of this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you can breed out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are plants that are immune to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's just plant aids.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've reached, I think we reached that as
a cultural phenomenon now as we've been so
[SPEAKER_02]: promiscuous in our in our ways that we
propagate and share that now we're
[SPEAKER_02]: experiencing the ramifications of like a
free love kind of situation or integrated
[SPEAKER_02]: pest management is not up to par or,
you know, are we just in a place where
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not educated enough and we have too
many people doing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, is this just what happens in,
in any species, any culture when we get to
[SPEAKER_02]: free will and to something arises.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what are your thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a weird and strange thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just saw something today on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, 99% of home grows are
infected.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like this, and I'm like,
really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this, is it that, is it that prevalent?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it that in everybody's situation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it coming through seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's why I let go a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I moved, it was like, I didn't feel
bad about letting go a lot of my stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: because you know, I've had it,
I've been able to keep it alive for so
[SPEAKER_02]: long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought, you know, it's time to start
new and it's time to allow those plants to
[SPEAKER_02]: just move on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have seeds for like a lot of the
different ones that I was using with
[SPEAKER_02]: males.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can always research it, but you know,
there's, you never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't have the finances to test all
my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anyone does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, where do we draw?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we fix this situation?
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like it's the, like the elephant
in the room that no one wants to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's definitely the
perfect analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the elephant in the room and people
are not talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've often wondered because essentially
like, I don't see a way to get rid of it
[SPEAKER_00]: per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the best you could do is sort of
quarantine it to like some area that's
[SPEAKER_00]: non-compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially like the idea is that if
we accept, there's still some conjecture
[SPEAKER_00]: around whether it goes into the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done that much research reading,
but I kind of am of the belief that it
[SPEAKER_00]: probably does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the figures that I've heard reliably
quoted from people I trust is like
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere from five to 30% transmission
rate into seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess if you believe that then
theoretically, if you get a pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: from a infected plant, then there's one
seed at least statistically, probably in
[SPEAKER_00]: 20, if it's 5% and we go low ball figures,
one in 20 seeds would have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's interesting because that would
mean that it's basically everywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: because there are people buying seeds
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was certainly around for a while
before we knew about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you said, although there might have
been some plants that were really showing
[SPEAKER_00]: signs of fatigue from it, there was likely
many others that were just looking
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively asymptomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It likely swept through a lot earlier than
we thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of practically what I thought
might happen is all the breeders,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, go get certified cuts like
what you've talked about doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you kind of just have to start
fresh and then have a policy of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't bring in clones really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you want to go get them tested
and then quarantine them and then slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: like a real sort of staged integration to
your area, it seems like if you were
[SPEAKER_00]: really serious about keeping it out,
that might be the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm sure there's some people who just
won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they would just sort of keep certain
plants around and it'll just sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to exist in a small part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the big facilities and the
breeders, if they did that, that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: one way you could get it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But see, I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, can it can it get transmitted like
on a shirt, like of a worker, like coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from like, is it like a bug like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of we still just don't really
know all that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be my thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for ages, I was worried about
people importing clones to Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bringing in all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like if it's in seeds and it's
already here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, I don't I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't it's kind of like I know it's in
the fluids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like kind of like it's it's it's kind
of like plant herpes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like we won't I don't think we can
get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that people will have to
just live with unless we get some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: science folks that are good at creating
some kind of antiviral preparation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just might be a part of our thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how do they mitigate it in hops?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what are they doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have places that are actively
spreading it like, you know, Darkheart was
[SPEAKER_02]: one of them that pretty much spread it to
all of California through their clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember seeing Trace coming into
different places and going and looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: me like those Darkheart clones look so
hideous.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so I mean, what is going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: They look like, you know, that and then
for them to recognize it and come up with
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're selling the the the remedy for
it somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just like we need people need to
be more responsible that are in these
[SPEAKER_02]: places of distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know these points, they're like
they're like vectors.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like disease vectors.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your nursery is a disease vector for
the entire state, you need to change your
[SPEAKER_02]: protocols like that's not OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it lies a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's I think maybe we can just ask
for greater scrutiny from vector points,
[SPEAKER_02]: nurseries and and and such.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's such a tough one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I do love that these new clone
nurseries like, you know, like Jason's one
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff where they're everything is
being verified and tested in Maristan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but even then, it's like one person
gets that into their room that has it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, oh, no, I just got this
clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, you know, I paid a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Maristan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's totally clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got it from something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it goes out and it gets it from
another plant in their garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like it's not like people that,
you know, at least with the person,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can get your HIV test or your herpes
test and you have the ability to things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But plants can't talk in that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't tell you that they infected by
a viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they can definitely talk to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's just it's another one of
those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be I'm very curious to see how
they mitigate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's a hop latent viroid,
like what do they do in hops?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how do they how do how they
outsmarted in hops?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's so much hops being
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh, I wish I knew I should have asked
Mahave.
[SPEAKER_00]: He he does a lot of writing about the
similarities between hops and cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that that would be really really
interesting to know what's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll have to wait and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you, since we last spoke,
Todd McCormick has come out with many of
[SPEAKER_00]: his offerings and specifically the purest
indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wanted to know, had you had a
chance to see it, try it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought a 50 pack of it because we grew
it at the at the Hayes Valley,
[SPEAKER_02]: the late trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a cool plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were really neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they weren't the most stable,
but they there was some really cool
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see how it was the progenitor for
maybe a lot of these trees that had the
[SPEAKER_02]: frost level level of kind of like the
white, but but really scruffy little
[SPEAKER_02]: plants like a baba and like really unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see it as a really cool foundation
for hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, not all of them had that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't have so much smell and some of
them had a little bit of a neat smell,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was mostly just very frosty and
very, very just powerful structure like I
[SPEAKER_02]: could see really unique and it's something
that surprised me that it was so unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's kind of like the first time
you grow like deep chunk or something,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't think we got to try any of
them because they all molded out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only issue is they do tend to
be very susceptible to most things that
[SPEAKER_02]: broadleafs will get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a shame, but there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I too have always thought it looked
similar to deep chunk and I'd love to give
[SPEAKER_00]: it a run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks neat and that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of that checks out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another line I wanted to follow up with
you, you know, I'm going to be honest,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so many strains and so many
questions that just relate to following up
[SPEAKER_00]: on various strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've seen a lot of people have been
playing with the fan favorite,
[SPEAKER_00]: the American Skunk Spray, aka the last
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any thoughts on using that one
again?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a follow up, any additional
thoughts about the Roadkill Skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you still think that Sterling Skunk is
just that's it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think there's something else
that the crowd is sort of endlessly
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it will be found or where are
we at with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have a better chance of finding
probably in those like Afghani selections
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're doing deep talking and those
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other groups that are working
out there, like, you know, supposedly some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the Maroof lines, like where they call
it the raunchy red or whatever they're,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're finding in that, in the point of
origin, they're trying to Roadkill things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I don't, Sterling Skunk is the
closest thing we have in seed form that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've come across.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what that Caleb has come
across for smell and it's a great
[SPEAKER_02]: out-crosser.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can really put that smell in other
things, but I think Roadkill Skunk was
[SPEAKER_02]: just like a class kind of like we have
gassy strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like back then they had stunky strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, there was a lot of different
stuff coming into the country back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: day, hash and buds and stuff brought back
from the hippie trail and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just what was being grown then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think like most people agree,
it was probably a problem to grow it for
[SPEAKER_02]: law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just got, it just got kind of
pushed to the side, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, some people remember it as being
this insanely potent and some other people
[SPEAKER_02]: believe that, you know, remember it being
not so potent, give you a headache.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, there's so many, it's,
it has that true time, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think it, I've smelled narrow leafs
that have, you know, you'd have a pissy,
[SPEAKER_02]: skunky smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just, it comes up in all
different plants, but mostly from those
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of, from that area, the stands kind
of like Central Asian strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: that seem to have it and seem to have had
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, it just kind of dried up in
the States.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, and then the ass,
ass was just a particularly skunky one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the strongest plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like hippie slayer is way more powerful
than that, you know, and that one is
[SPEAKER_02]: equally as hideous, but it's more on the
pissy side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I just gave Hayes Valley a
new one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to get the name, Dutch oven or
Doritos with three Z or garlic death
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheetos or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a, it's a rework of the,
it used to be called the dragon,
[SPEAKER_02]: not dragon souls and dragon's ass,
whatever the stinky one was that I made a
[SPEAKER_02]: long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically a new version of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so crystalline and the bud structure
is so nice and it's so hideous and so
[SPEAKER_02]: gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people really like to smoke the really
hideous stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be a new kind of, it's an ass
variant, any more ass in your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm so happy that people are enjoying
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I share that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I even gave, I think I gave carnivore
stray Fox and jaws, all F1 seeds of ass to
[SPEAKER_02]: find their own ass and work into and make
their own ass stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, we find cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to give it to other breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's what the whole, the band-aid
thing Hayes, that was all we gave that
[SPEAKER_02]: male that made the band-aid Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we gave that out to like four
different breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they all made a music, amazing things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob Hempel got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kagu got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dot D got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think ET got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, if you find something cool,
share it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think males, male sharing should be like
a whole new thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how, I know people will try
and sell pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems hard pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's such a hard thing to keep viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, maybe if you packed it in dry ice
or something, but share your males,
[SPEAKER_02]: share your females.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, if you made something,
cool makes you, someone else can make
[SPEAKER_02]: something cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, if everybody gives you a box of
crowns, draw a picture, make it a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Hey, there was that G13 Hayes that
went around Amsterdam, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that went to everybody's garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody had a G13 Hayes hybrids from
Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and like, and what I always say to
people is, and this is something I've
[SPEAKER_00]: learned over time, you know, um,
and maybe others learned it straight away,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like, I'm, I'm just trying to say,
you know, I don't poo poo anyone for not
[SPEAKER_00]: being aware of this, but like,
I'm of the same view.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, give it out and share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even if someone does something
really cool with it, your, you will still
[SPEAKER_00]: be in the story of like, that's where it
came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's heaps of people in our scene
who are really well known through exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, it's not any, nothing gets
detracted from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone else does something cool with
your work, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, it's like,
you get to be part of this amazing,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a history.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, why not be part of,
you know, in 50 years, when the bards go
[SPEAKER_02]: out and sing their hymns of all the great
cannabis creations, like be part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Open up, share.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're all in this together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all working on the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, this is the coolest thing you
can get involved in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I always tell people there's so
many rad things in life you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get into food, you can get into
art, you can do all these things,
[SPEAKER_02]: but cannabis is the only thing that you
can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually manifests in your mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it has a biochemical situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like food is amazing chefs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I love, like I'm more on the
plant-based side.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love food and I love to see what people
can be creative with food and all the
[SPEAKER_02]: things, but, and you elicit emotional
responses, but it doesn't get you
[SPEAKER_02]: illuminated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it doesn't open up new experiences in
your mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what an incredible thing that you can
grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can trim it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can breed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're done, you finally get to
bring it into yourself and experience it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what other things do you get to
inhale into your biology and become a part
[SPEAKER_02]: of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that idea of becoming part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That resonates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and you know what, just in line with
what we just said, I got to give my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: a bin chick and a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a bloke who's creating like these
crazy ABC hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are like on par with modern strains,
but they look like ABC plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and he's actually used some of my
work in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was saying to my wife the other day,
I was like, this is so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think this guy is going to go down
as like the dude who game changed ABC
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my work's just kind of embedded in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's so neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that feels awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I'm stoked for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're part of the mandala of something
super cool and neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's ABC is so all those lines like the
ABC and the freak show and like these
[SPEAKER_02]: mutants, like mutants are rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know me and Caleb both, we're both
big mutant guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why he does so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is fun and cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not easy to do what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a labor of love.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like somebody finding their
niche and really taking it further.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like it, you know, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, it's cool that while,
you know, Wally duck being a part of that,
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I saw a pack of old Wally duck,
ABC duck's foot seeds or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it has so many names.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Quays?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the, what's the other name that
they used to call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: That Fett used to call it as a name.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it doesn't, it all go back to
like an Australian progenitor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's like duck's foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so Wally duck stuff, it,
it goes back to just some random guy in
[SPEAKER_00]: his town, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of the ABC stuff goes back
to, for the most part, it all goes back to
[SPEAKER_00]: this, this one guy we've managed to track
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave it to a few different people
over the years, but he was offline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he never had any idea that like it was
popular online.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just thought it was this weird thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have like what Hawaiian
duck's foot, like mutants, like that's
[SPEAKER_02]: something that people aren't, yeah,
it kind of fell off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand why.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I asked the same work with
like people doing all these incredible new
[SPEAKER_02]: autos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how awesome is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's something that I, it
fascinates me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just the, how did they make the
autos?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not something that I'd want to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's such a, it's like driving a
race car because you can't go backwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like backwards, you're going so fast,
breeding these really cool things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you, you can't, since you're
always in auto, you can't catch,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, you can only go forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that how it is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you do these photo period ones that
are basis at 18 or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've almost touched on to the next
question I was going to ask you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for getting me there,
which was, I was, I wanted to ask,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in terms of like the way you
view breeding or philosophies on breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: has anything changed since we last spoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some of the things you spoke about
last time is, you know, really flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: out the males to see what they're fully
offering and, and resinous males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's a cool little added advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anything changed since then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you, do you feel like your views on
anything have shifted at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, there's so many.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a cool topic and everybody kind
of likes, it's like always a question
[SPEAKER_02]: like, oh, how do you do, what do you do
for breeding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for me now, I feel like I've
developed like almost a sixth sense for
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I can just, I know it sounds dumb,
but you can almost feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I'll double check myself by
flowering stuff, you know, males out
[SPEAKER_02]: really far or doing all the smell tests
and checking them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to, you know, I'll have a mail room
and I just check the mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throughout their period, you know,
because before they sex, they smell
[SPEAKER_02]: differently than after they sex on the
stem rub.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can get unique experiences like
before they even sex or so many different
[SPEAKER_02]: ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when people ask me, breathing,
there's goal-based breeding and there's
[SPEAKER_02]: exploratory breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the breeding of, of, you know,
looking at new plants, looking at things
[SPEAKER_02]: you've never seen before, finding the
outliers, finding special things,
[SPEAKER_02]: finding new smells or finding new
morphology, really digging in the gene
[SPEAKER_02]: pool and exploring it and really finding
unique things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you see something that's really
special, putting that into your collection
[SPEAKER_02]: and knowing that maybe at some point
you're going to find the perfect partner
[SPEAKER_02]: for that, for this amazing, you know,
F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can always say that my motto is like
extreme possibilities is putting two
[SPEAKER_02]: completely different things together to
create something of total majesty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And beauty, that's the, you know,
that is so incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then by that point in that F1,
you, you get that hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get that you're basically,
it's the gift of mother nature saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: thank you for putting these two creations
that are completely different environments
[SPEAKER_02]: and created shape through time and space
together to, to create something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like the true essence,
I think of as F1 breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where you're really going to
find a lot of magic and also allow the
[SPEAKER_02]: person, if you give a seat to someone,
they not only get to experience that
[SPEAKER_02]: magic, but if they like it, they can do
F2s and really explore the parents and
[SPEAKER_02]: understand what created those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it could be a whole teaching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I almost think of the seeds I create
is like an interactive teaching course,
[SPEAKER_02]: like take something that's very solid and
something that's very well known and allow
[SPEAKER_02]: people to explore that and make new
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they like it, go further,
like it go even further.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you've find plants and you
get that experience and you get those
[SPEAKER_02]: extreme possibilities and you feel
familiar and you really want to go for,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you can go into goal breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, I love what this,
how the plant smokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another plant that's like,
has an incredible smell, but it just has
[SPEAKER_02]: shoddy structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like goal breeding is, it's a process
and you can really, you can add goals on
[SPEAKER_02]: as you move through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, most, breeding
today is goal breeding, but I really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really suggest and encourage people to do
exploratory breeding, really see the
[SPEAKER_02]: unique things that can come out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by default, a lot of today's breeding
is exploratory breeding because we're
[SPEAKER_02]: putting together these insane mishmashes,
you know, and in those mishmashes,
[SPEAKER_02]: there is great treasure, but in those
mishmashes, you're going to have to hunt
[SPEAKER_02]: through a lot of plants because they are
going to segregate out in a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the magic of F1s, if even F1s
that aren't dissimilar enough to get
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrid rigor, you're still getting the
unique traits of just two plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like for tips for breeding,
yeah, grow as many plants as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a big mom room, have a big dad room,
keep things around that you like,
[SPEAKER_02]: back things up in seed form.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stem rubbing is a great way to see how
turpy something is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may not smell like that once it's
flowered out, but there are plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: are true to their stem rub.
[SPEAKER_02]: And stem rub before sexing because you're
going to get a different smell before and
[SPEAKER_02]: after.
[SPEAKER_02]: For seed making, like I always tell
people, you don't have your, you can make
[SPEAKER_02]: seed, you can pollinate a plant and put it
right back into your mom room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to keep it in the flower
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you can do that outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make seeds outside and bring it
inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once your pistols are pollinated,
as long as the plant is healthy and happy,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're making seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to have so much space.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to create these moms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have a revolving room and you can
do so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such an easy plant to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the key is sharing and caring
and finding your niche and just
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find that plant that you rightly identify
and understanding it and talking to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't believe in plant
communication, but I believe plant
[SPEAKER_02]: communication is through the heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: The heart has like, I think it's what,
5,000 times the magnetic field of the
[SPEAKER_02]: brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're finding out now that it's
basically like the sixth sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is basically the heart is a field
generator, it's a signal generator,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it moves out beyond the body and
interacts with everything around it,
[SPEAKER_02]: other humans, plants, things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if you can listen and tune
into that, that's a really effective
[SPEAKER_02]: strategy to breed is to let the plants
talk to you and you talk back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's through the heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I mean, I'm sure you have a
similar thing, especially being a
[SPEAKER_02]: musician.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think being a musician really allows you
to happen emotive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very emotional music.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a pathway to plant life
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as time goes by, I feel like,
A, just from an empirical point of view,
[SPEAKER_00]: of all the males I've toyed around with in
the past, the two that I consider to have
[SPEAKER_00]: been sort of the most success in terms of
the offspring were ones that I definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: had more of a connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt that connection, whereas there's
other times I've used male where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, looks good, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I've got one male I've been
lugging around with me for almost four
[SPEAKER_00]: years now, and I've only just used it for
the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I thought, tell you what,
no one can say I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept it for three years, going,
no, it's time will come, but it's not yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yeah, you'll have males in
your, in your mom room that literally
[SPEAKER_02]: like, I know, yeah, someday this is going
to be perfect for something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's other males that it's like,
they just want to dust everything all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's they have their own time and they
will talk to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants kind of tell you what,
who they want to be with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can almost feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you work with plants enough and
you really open up to them, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't, you can, you almost know what
needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you're, I know we, you know,
people are like, oh, we select the plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: but do we, are the plants selecting
through us?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is the selector of us that's selecting
the plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it us?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it something higher than us?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as when I used to DJ and we were
on vinyl, we used, we tried to just open
[SPEAKER_02]: up to source and open up to the crowd
because we're usually like in nature and
[SPEAKER_02]: having these big free sound system
parties.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the key was to open up to the
experience of what we're doing this
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible celebration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by being clear, you'll know what,
what music needs to come next because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: a feedback loop through the dancers,
the DJ and source.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's an emotional, it's an emotional
connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we can develop that just like,
you know, I think the greatest musicians
[SPEAKER_02]: are the ones that they had that special
gift of I think are any artists,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's the whole thing with
art and science, with breeding and all of
[SPEAKER_02]: these, you know, what now with scientific
breeding and everybody saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you guys don't know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to do this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this it's like, no, not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, there's no way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show me one strain, notable strain by any
scientific reader that's in the,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's in the cultural domain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's no, none that have held
the test of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like, I can't think of anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, this guy made this and he's a
scientific reader and we still grow that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, no, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not really anything out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all people that are doing this for
the love, you know, and do you,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you want to listen to machines or do
you want to listen to plants on this one?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, it's kind of a non
sequitur.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Science always wants to make it better,
but it's already better and it's better
[SPEAKER_02]: through us making it better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think breeding is just doing it for
the love and really having an open heart
[SPEAKER_02]: and an open mind and really taking notes
and taking notice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, I have tons of breeding
books that I can go back years and years
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're just scribbles, but I don't
have the best memory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I sometimes I'll look back and I'll
be like, Oh my God, I forgot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I chose this one or this one
was this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I did that when I like, Oh,
that wasn't the original mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually used the different one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you're kind of in this,
this beautiful creation autopilot.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't write it down, sometimes you
don't even remember all the magic was
[SPEAKER_02]: happening because you're kind of in the
moment with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's where, where the fun
really resides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you've, you've got to be in the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to feel that connection more than
just some sort of a textbook criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I used to ask this question about
like, you know, if a robot just had a
[SPEAKER_00]: checklist, would it just not pick the best
mail?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's sort of, again,
is the crux of what we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in and amongst that, you mentioned the
word book.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the memorable things in our first
episode was we, we did a little book club,
[SPEAKER_00]: had some book recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear, have you been reading
anything recently that you'd love to give
[SPEAKER_00]: a big ups to, or, or a recommendation for
people to have a read on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed some people are reading as much
as it's more of like a, it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of YouTube and a lot of movies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed with the younger generation,
but for books, yeah, I don't get as much
[SPEAKER_02]: reading time as I like, but I sure would.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I like anything by,
if you want to go more into like plant
[SPEAKER_02]: spirit communication, like Steven Booner,
Elliott Cowell, let me think.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many cool things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to go back and really get back
into that pinnacle of like the natural
[SPEAKER_02]: science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the scientist movement, like Steiner
and, you know, who else is like Luther
[SPEAKER_02]: Burbank is another, you know, you want to
talk about hype reader for the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Luther Burbank was like friends with
everybody from Ford to presidents.
[SPEAKER_02]: People would come to see him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he was the man and he created so many
different, so many different varieties of
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and fruits and vegetables,
like, like, like some insane amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he did crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would, if you ask him how he did it,
like he is the guy that tried to create a
[SPEAKER_02]: spineless cactus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was reading about like how he did
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did it, you know, he had a really
insane knack for selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he had like one of the, he was
considered like one of the greatest plant
[SPEAKER_02]: readers of all time, just because his
ability to connect to the plant on a
[SPEAKER_02]: different, on that kind of heart level.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he would just do all kinds of crazy
combinations and pollinate all these
[SPEAKER_02]: different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then his knack of selection was just
incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he, one of the stories I heard about
him was he would talk to the cactus and
[SPEAKER_02]: say, Hey, you're safe here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to make spines.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got you covered.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, you don't need, you know,
you're totally protected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each generation they would select,
they would say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually he made a spineless cactus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And isn't that wild?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of the same story as
there's, I heard about, there was a plant
[SPEAKER_02]: harvester and herbalist who also would get
their stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tested and they did a test where they went
out the field to harvest, like column
[SPEAKER_02]: three or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they went out and so first they
harvested it and then they went out to
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest it second time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second time the night before they
went out and told the plants why they were
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting and what they needed from them
and what they'd be using for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plants they, they talked to
naturally had higher levels of the
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial compounds that they needed for
healing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, there's so much cool stuff
that just kind of got the kibush put on
[SPEAKER_02]: it, like just around, you know,
right as automobiles and stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're kind of kicking the gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think after World War II, we kind of
lost the heart and soul of, of really
[SPEAKER_02]: working with plants as, as, you know,
as we lost a lot of our, our traditional
[SPEAKER_02]: ways of working with plants and a lot of
our traditional cultivars too,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well through, you know, just get,
you know, feeding people and get trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: get what we could to the markets and
really not falling back into the farmer's
[SPEAKER_02]: markets and to all, you know, I mean,
the people don't realize too, the
[SPEAKER_02]: migration to America where everybody came,
everybody came, but everybody brought
[SPEAKER_02]: their seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were seeds from all over Europe,
from every part of the world that people
[SPEAKER_02]: came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only did we have an amazing
melting pot of humans, we had an amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: germ plasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had an amazing like gene pool of stuff
from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've slowly lost that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a potent, like a,
a symbol and a metaphor for what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: having now with our own cannabis,
gene pool, bottlenecking, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if people want to see a really
cool movie, there's a movie called Seed
[SPEAKER_02]: the Untold Story.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really cool thing, all about
seeds and how we've lost a lot of our seed
[SPEAKER_02]: stock over time through different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else is cool?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I would just say if you're going
to go, if you're old enough to be reading
[SPEAKER_02]: books, I would say Steiner, it's a great
natural scientist, Booner, all the
[SPEAKER_02]: ethnobotanists.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terrence McKenna, you never go wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I can listen to Terrence McKenna
interviews the rest of my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think he is probably the all time,
him and Bob Marley should be the rulers of
[SPEAKER_02]: music and science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because, you know, Bob Marley,
everywhere you go on the planet,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's a saint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody knows Bob Marley's songs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go into the Nepal, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, there's these people that have
shaped people's lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's trying to think of books that I
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Schultes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love, you know, what is going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: I love actually some of these new websites
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, I just like what everybody's
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'm really digging podcasts
because now, you know, when you work,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't read, you can listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been digging a lot of the
podcasts and, you know, even stuff like in
[SPEAKER_02]: different things like micro entrepreneur,
like on all the mushroom stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love some of the science stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love a lot of the magical stuff and
a lot of alchemy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like alchemy is, physical alchemy has
never been my thing, but I really love
[SPEAKER_02]: inner alchemy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love to hear a lot of the,
you know, some of the Eastern philosophy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, people get, just get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find stuff that's cool and like,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's so much out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, people always ask me my,
like kind of what my meditation practice
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's my primary one that I
have an initiation into would be Kashmir
[SPEAKER_02]: Shaivism.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a really powerful form
of meditation and a unique way of seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also very similar to even certain
Buddhist path, like Zojian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are great starts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super ancient Taoism, like barefoot doctor
style, like going back and really just
[SPEAKER_02]: walking with nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still practitioners in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just find the same thing in anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find your niche.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find the things that really allow you to
flower, to flourish, to bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cause the world is a big old
dump of compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this world right now is nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're making right now is BS,
like compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, so now it's the time to plant your
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's where they're going to grow
best.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the micro life is there from all
the junk that, and it's, it's our time to
[SPEAKER_02]: shine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's our time to really bring this,
this place back through planting ourselves
[SPEAKER_02]: into it fully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like bloom where you're planted,
like be the best you can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use cannabis to be a better person.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when we finally get our merch
store again, I want to make cool shirts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like not just stuff like,
you know, A5 or C5, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like those ones about like, you know,
cannabis made me a better person t-shirt
[SPEAKER_02]: or, you know, do you even wash bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's your plants wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many, it's like, we have such a
funny culture and so much, there's so much
[SPEAKER_02]: joy that can be generated in this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we need to focus on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people so much, what's up with
everybody having a beef with everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can everyone just, just do your own thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is everybody uptight so much?
[SPEAKER_02]: You smoke another joint and go take a walk
in the forest and tell me about it after
[SPEAKER_02]: words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it that big of a deal?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the ongoing paradox,
you know, how come, how can we all be so
[SPEAKER_00]: angry when there's so many joints to calm
you down?
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you know, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bodie, the historical channeler of a non,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Peaceful resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, you actually just quickly
mentioned a comment about the shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got so many people asking about the
shirts, but also as a bit of a follow up,
[SPEAKER_00]: just in general, is there going to be some
way people might be able to go in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future to get info about upcoming drops,
about merch, stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where should they keep an eye on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it like your Instagram for the moment,
watch this space sort of thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: or is there a site?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, first I want to preface like as an
apology to everybody in the community that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been such a hermit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I really like, it's been a
challenging couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just been a massive exodus to get to
where we are now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when things get really hard,
I just kind of go inward and stick to
[SPEAKER_02]: family and plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so yeah, it's been a difficult time,
but I feel like that we're putting our
[SPEAKER_02]: roots down and we're really going to make
a commitment to be an inspiration and to
[SPEAKER_02]: be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm going to try and be more on
that forums are hard because I'm such a
[SPEAKER_02]: slow writer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try and be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try and, I mean, I think
we're finally getting a website.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to come out of the shadows.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to bring the merch back.
[SPEAKER_02]: The merch stopped because, you know,
when we moved, we couldn't really sustain
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We couldn't buy the stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, we didn't have the time or energy
to do it or the finances.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're working into doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the silkscreen shirts from Bro
Brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are my favorite, but we're also
looking to other, other ways and also kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of moving out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe even something like a lifestyle
brand or something like just trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: make, you know, more stickers,
like just change people's minds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I like things like even funny
things like, you know, the matrix was a
[SPEAKER_02]: documentary bumper sticker, you know,
like, you know, bring things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, definitely merch will be coming,
you know, it'll definitely be the same
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, but also there's going to be new
Nurica and medicine mountain and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just takes time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I do so much and I'm just
exhausted at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, every night I have like a million
people on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to write back and every day that I
don't, I kind of eat away a little bit my
[SPEAKER_02]: soul, but I'm going to, yeah, I'm going to
really do my best to, to, and all of us,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we have my wife, Sage,
Suriyama, we're all working together right
[SPEAKER_02]: now and the three of us to kind of bring
it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, especially in the, especially in
the darkest time and age when,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's like either it's,
you gotta, you can either just fall back
[SPEAKER_02]: into the shadows or you can really stand
up and be a light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's time to shine,
you know, in the darkest times it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: time when it really, really needs to
shine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm, I feel like we're rebirthing and I
feel like, I hope that everybody is
[SPEAKER_02]: rebirthing and can feel that this is the
time where we all need to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's kind of a weird roundabout
thing about do we ever have merch coming?
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I think, yeah, the merch is
coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just might take a little bit and it
might first start maybe on some service
[SPEAKER_02]: like printable or something, something for
the colorful shirts, but eventually get
[SPEAKER_02]: the silk screened ones back and the
hoodies and the hats.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're, you know, trying to make it a
macronomical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people will be very excited to hear
there's something available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, in good time things come.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I'm sure people will be happy to
grab what's available in the near future
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you one last question
before we jump into a few of the Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: submitted ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, have you got any thoughts
about the Iraqi lines you worked with?
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the Iraqi Rania was some really
memorable smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, any, is that just sort of,
you know, in the, in the mix at the moment
[SPEAKER_00]: or any plans?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that was, that was straight
Fox's brother, I thought brought that
[SPEAKER_02]: back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and yeah, that's such a cool line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, um, it was kind of like,
since it was straight, we were just kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of collaborating and doing stuff with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I, we did grow one, um, the seed,
I have a bunch of seeds that I've made to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep the line alive, but the germ ratio
has kind of fallen off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did get one or two at the last,
um, Hayes Valley grow off and it's such a
[SPEAKER_02]: cool strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it, it's very gourmand, which,
you know, it's very, it's, it has the kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of like the coffee house smells and
flavors of cinnamon and cloves and cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has such a great high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a slight, it can be slightly unstable
and it's, I haven't quite figured out how
[SPEAKER_02]: or what, you know, how sometimes after a
couple of crosses, you can be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it doesn't do well with this kind of
plant or it doesn't like this,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it doesn't like other broad
leaves or it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm still trying to figure that out,
but that one's definitely, that one's
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely still on point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would like, yeah, I'll talk to Stray
and see if he wants to do anything cool
[SPEAKER_02]: with that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then I have another Persian line
from a, uh, a friend of a friend who she
[SPEAKER_02]: goes to visit her family.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to check that one out too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, some of those, those are so like
people don't realize like those are
[SPEAKER_02]: broadly those like point of origin
broadleafs are so cool and fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they really encompass like every
imaginable smell and flavor and even the
[SPEAKER_02]: fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, there's some of the,
if you want to find stuff that hasn't been
[SPEAKER_02]: hybridized yet, I mean, it's sad because
the reason why it hasn't been hybridized
[SPEAKER_02]: is because it's from war torn countries
that have been occupied by, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, people that don't take kindly to
anything coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's kind of our last our last
hunting grounds for truly unique old
[SPEAKER_02]: school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even then, I mean, they clear cut it a
lot of their, um, their narrow leaf plants
[SPEAKER_02]: when they started growing for massive hash
production, you know, like 30 years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was still a lot of narrow leaf hash
plants and Sativas and some of the finest
[SPEAKER_02]: hash was made with, uh, more highland
narrow stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as the warlords and the mass
production came in, they switched over to
[SPEAKER_02]: the more hashy broadly stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I mean, there's so much cool
stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still buy so rad, you know,
and people do, I, there's a lot of cool
[SPEAKER_02]: people doing unique stuff where people
look at like Jade Mecter and Jeff and his
[SPEAKER_02]: garden in Boulder Creek.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grows a lot of incredible plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go and look at it every year and it's
just fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some of them I think aren't
totally a hundred percent what they are,
[SPEAKER_02]: but everyone is fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some ones that just are so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the fillers of Philip Pinot purple
one that's so rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some great Mexicans and ties
and like he grows stuff from all over the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's super fascinating to see in a,
in a big garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I almost think like someday
I wish there was like theme parks or
[SPEAKER_02]: botanical parks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's like, Oh, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I know Rob and Mojave,
um, they get, they got to go to some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the new, uh, uh, department of
agriculture, uh, grows where they were
[SPEAKER_02]: growing out these massive sessions in
like, where was it some ways back East.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also at Davis and getting to see
these government collections of seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: seed lines that were like, they were
growing out like thousands of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would love to see like the public
kids to really check these things out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would probably die if I went to one of
these, because all the males, all the
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen, I'd go into hazmat suit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm so hyper allergic to pollen now
that I've developed over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, it starts out,
everything's good, but after 20 years,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even, I got to wear like a,
like a, like I've gone to war or something
[SPEAKER_02]: to pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of curiosity, you just attribute
that to just like repeated exposure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be like in the beginning,
I wasn't as, it wasn't as intense,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, I see a lot of people that
just can wade through pollen and it's no
[SPEAKER_02]: problem, but yeah, I'm not really an
allergic person, but I think just over
[SPEAKER_02]: time, like I can get it on my skin and it
itches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't, if I, I'll just gush even a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll gush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to go in and do sometimes do stuff
like some of my males pre flower and I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: come out gushing snot everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I can't remember exactly what happens,
but I think, uh, Fletcher of archive also
[SPEAKER_00]: historically has like some sort of
reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember if it's pollen or
trichomes, but yeah, he, he too has some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of reaction and is like, got to be
careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's something to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's certain tremors, some tremors
develop issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually for, yeah, like skin and like
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some people can't handle it for
some reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, they're just, it just sets
something off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, terpenes, like, let's talk about,
is that a topic?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what if, if there's really
400,000, which I'm not sure that there
[SPEAKER_02]: really is, but that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there is like what a palette and what,
what, I mean, I don't even know how to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's, these are biochemical,
it's a biochemical language spoken to all
[SPEAKER_02]: of creation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's being generated by plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what are they talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what are the, all these,
like, what are we're not privy to like,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's really going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I was in Amazon,
I, you know, I realized that there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole communication network that we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: No clue about, and it was the insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, when I was doing my thesis
work in Amazon, I was like, and I realized
[SPEAKER_02]: that the bugs, that's the, that's the true
internet, the wifi.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell everything going on in entire
forest, just listening to the insects and
[SPEAKER_02]: the birds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was their own language.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can only imagine what nature is saying
through these, these, this language,
[SPEAKER_02]: biochemical languages of aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really curious to see where it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you've explained, it's more and
more information about terpenes and their
[SPEAKER_00]: characterizations is coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems more and more easy to
present, to present the argument that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is capable of producing any
terpene profile because of the diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: of composition and combinations it can do
with the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, what you see is that
we're not really finding new flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles, which is kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and then we're not even finding,
we're finding these like hyper aromatic
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes where like they're not even
reading in some of these labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, but they're more
perceptible than the ones that are there
[SPEAKER_02]: by, by weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, so there's terpenes that
we're not even even knowing, but our,
[SPEAKER_02]: but our nasal center is so equipped to
pull out sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're reacting, even though people
are like, Oh, well, this is have the exact
[SPEAKER_02]: same, you know, it's just got myrcin and
pinene and limonene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, and this strain does too,
but they do different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that some cannabinoid that we have,
we haven't even discovered yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's active and super, you know,
super minuscule things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it terpenes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it, is it the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's itself is it's like, what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what is creating these effects?
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't seem like anyone has a clue
except the plants, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: no one seems to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that, you know, or even the entourage
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a basic, basic entourage
effect that certain things like when a
[SPEAKER_02]: wall is calming and, and finding is
rejuvenating and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then we have all the citrus,
you know, style ones that are very
[SPEAKER_02]: energizing, but are they really leading
the high?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's like, what is going, what is
happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where, where are the effects coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look, you've kind of almost
stumbled into one of the questions the
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon fans submitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we jump into it and we'll
start with this one, which sort of leads
[SPEAKER_00]: on, which is over the years, have you
found any strains that you feel were
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly good for pain killing or have
you heard of anything that's good for like
[SPEAKER_00]: say mild opioid withdrawal?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I ask is because I've found
some strains like sour D is really good
[SPEAKER_00]: for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wondering, do we think maybe some
strains activate opioid receptors?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also heard old hash plants can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and I mean, that's even cool that
sour D is doing that because, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: traditionally a lot of people like sativas
will intensify their, or whatever you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to call it, sativa, you know, at least
intensify that pain response.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it comes back to being, so personal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's classic ones that are for
pain, like, you know, bubba kush has
[SPEAKER_02]: always been a great thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Master kush is, you know, like the
sunshine daydream is good for nerve pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain broadleafs that are naturally very
relaxing and euphoria creating can do
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's weird when you get into
stuff like depression, you want real day
[SPEAKER_02]: brighteners.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it seems to be, we're back to
that same thing of really getting to try
[SPEAKER_02]: plants to find what really gives us that
relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with our gene pool dropping and
becoming very homogenized and very inbred
[SPEAKER_02]: and bottlenecks and on a consumer level,
our choices are getting reduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's to be harder and harder to find those
strains, those individual strains that can
[SPEAKER_02]: help us with our daily, our maladies and
our, you know, our dis-ease, like what it
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, I think it comes back again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, is grow, inspire, trade,
gift, support, do whatever you can to make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that the diversity of your cannabis
is within our reach and really share that
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think there was someone a
while back on one of the forums that was
[SPEAKER_02]: making a list and everybody could put in
their two cents of what plants were doing
[SPEAKER_02]: what for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause people could be like, Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, some people were
like, Oh, well that one actually that does
[SPEAKER_02]: the opposite for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are, you know, it seems like
maybe there's near there's kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's maybe you fall into groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there's like three groups or four
groups or five groups of people and
[SPEAKER_02]: different strains kind of work for their
biology, whether they're in a,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, some people are endocannabinoid
deficient, you know, where, and some
[SPEAKER_02]: people like we have one of our kids,
you could give him like a whole entire
[SPEAKER_02]: edible cake and he won't even get hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has that enzyme thing where it doesn't
break down cannabinoids in the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's so many fascinating things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess it's just getting the
information and information on a
[SPEAKER_02]: grassroots level, because the machine
ain't going to tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if it is, it's not going to be for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now is when we're having the
pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you have pain right now,
you're not, I mean, you're not going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: talking to a machine about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to ask your friend,
you're going to ask me dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be looking for that kind
of information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess spread the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I a hundred percent resonate with what
you're saying about like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: without the ability to try that wide
exposure of things, how are you going to
[SPEAKER_00]: find the thing that hits the spot for this
very specific issue that works for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe not for the next person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a, it's sort of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sort of thought to myself when I first
started buying seeds, let's say around
[SPEAKER_00]: 2010, I felt like there was just a whisper
of cookies, hybrids in the market and
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly a whole range of relatively diverse
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nowadays it's like the polar opposite
15 years or so later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, there's barely,
there's a whisper of things on offer that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have cookies in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, very little, very little
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think we'll ever be able to get out
of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think it's just, it's gone too
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to get stuff that sort of doesn't have
any cookies or it's progenitors onwards is
[SPEAKER_00]: just going to be like, you know,
the diehard forum head type stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wonder, I mean, through,
through marketing and for, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the power of propaganda and, and,
and just their ability, they have an
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible, I mean, cookies have forced us
an incredible ability.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just shape the consumer landscape of
what people want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's kind of anchored itself
into history.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we, I think it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookies is now in the same league as like
a OG Kush and Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of created its own category.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're kind of be kind of stuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just up to, you know, the small
breeders to find those new things and
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe look outside of, of, of those
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, lots of people love those
cookies hybrids and they do, they work
[SPEAKER_02]: really well for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's always going to be a place,
but yeah, I think, I think if we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: start looking outside of what we're
consume every day, we're never going to
[SPEAKER_02]: find those outliers, you know,
and maybe it may be the newest thing will
[SPEAKER_02]: come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like if you have a poly hybrid,
poly hybrid, poly hybrid, poly hybrid,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you go through a thousand seeds,
you may find something that's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: that has that some kind of ancient like,
you know, recessive plant from,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's just the, that's popped out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the new thing because it's a
little bit of everything made so
[SPEAKER_02]: incredibly sublime and perfect that,
that it carves a place in the history of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I even, and the whole thing with
triploids, like sometimes they're found.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought, I think they say like Mac might
be a triploid.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a, people still find a lot of
their mutants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still amazing treasure to be
found.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are, nature still creates all these
things and it's mostly about just opening
[SPEAKER_02]: our eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's incredible stuff to find still,
but I think it's, and there's such a magic
[SPEAKER_02]: to the hunt, to the treasure, to the
treasure hunters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I think seeds will never go
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's regulates to always
have a place because sure you can add S2
[SPEAKER_02]: stock, but I've noticed with S1s,
you know, you have to look through a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of S1s to get something cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You find some amazing combinations,
but it's, it's just as much a hunt and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you don't have any guys to help back
you it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be able to do the hunt and you
don't want to have to hunt through stock
[SPEAKER_00]: where the odds aren't stacked in your
favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, while we're on the topic,
people have been waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may as well jump into it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we mentioned, cookies, a lot of people
have been wondering a lot of speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me about the cookies endeavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you get into it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking back, what are some of your
thoughts?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it experiences like, I think it's
an amazing learning experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I, I'm, I'm glad I embarked on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I lost a lot of my reputation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I realized that that was going to happen
and I had to make a decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was, I had this opportunity to do
something that I thought could really
[SPEAKER_02]: change the landscape of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and it kind of, it didn't necessarily
come to fruition, but at least I tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the story that came out, like when I
was originally making the lavender
[SPEAKER_02]: lemonade and really wanting to get into
strain design and getting into nursery
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I knew that I would have to be moving
from my farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went, I didn't have a, I didn't
really have anything I was able to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I kind of prayed on it and sent the
word out and kind of put out energy that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I'd like to do some strain
design.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the funny thing is like, of course I
had a dream that the first people that off
[SPEAKER_02]: that wanted to do my streams was cookies,
which I thought was so weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, there's no way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over time a friend to a friend said,
Hey, burner wants to talk to you about
[SPEAKER_02]: some stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was like, I wasn't, you know,
I'd like to make everybody kind of work
[SPEAKER_02]: for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they kept on trying and trying and
like, well, let's go on a walk in the
[SPEAKER_02]: forest or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know, nothing panned out,
but eventually, you know, I, he offered to
[SPEAKER_02]: come visit him at his house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and we got to, you know, over about a
year's time, maybe I came over a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: times and we had some really good talks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I really found him to be a kind of
fun and unique kind of gentleman,
[SPEAKER_02]: like definitely a Gandalf level like
hustler and manifester.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I thought was really cool in a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, it got to give him credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's created this, uh, movement that,
and this, this force that has pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: terraformed the cannabis culture in a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I thought that was a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found everybody at cookies to be
pretty passionate and actually cool and
[SPEAKER_02]: down to earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I enjoyed talking with them and I
enjoyed, I explained what I kind of was
[SPEAKER_02]: into.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I brought, we brought samples and it
was really into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talked about stuff and we kind of
had a, I think, you know, we had a common
[SPEAKER_02]: ideal that we need that the gene pool
we're moving into a place that they were
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of moving into a place where they
couldn't get out of their bottlenecking
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves into their own creation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though this creation is, you know,
like steering a huge sector of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis space for what people want to try
and enjoy and what's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was naturally about to snuff itself out
like a flame well, when it get,
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't get oxygen, you know, and we
talked about different plants and land,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, land races or heirlooms and,
um, and old days and kind of just went
[SPEAKER_02]: through a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, uh, asked if I wanted to do
genetics with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I had to think long and
hard and he was like, no, this is a really
[SPEAKER_02]: great opportunity to really expose a lot
of people to really unique and new things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the flagship strain that we start with
was the supernatural selections,
[SPEAKER_02]: Congo, Kashmir, which actually made it
onto the menu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and after that we were going to do a
lot more kind of these, like creating
[SPEAKER_02]: some, uh, lines like the DLA 5.3 was going
to be the chocolate milk, white chocolate,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, really create some new flavors and
new, um, effects and new, uh, things and
[SPEAKER_02]: really open people's minds to like a whole
new world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by having these new flavors,
it benefit them because they are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to offer these things that no
one's really ever experienced in that part
[SPEAKER_02]: of the community and really opened some
minds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for us, for my, I mean, I think we
both had our own ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to kind of get the gene pull out
of a bottleneck and also really show some
[SPEAKER_02]: other sides of cannabis and, you know,
uh, things are going along.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were supposed to have these big
containers to be able to do lots of phenol
[SPEAKER_02]: runs, but it never really panned out the
containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they kept on having a hard time
getting them licensed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and they'd always, you know,
we couldn't start and it just went longer
[SPEAKER_02]: and longer and, um, things just kind of
fell apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any ill will at all to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found them, you know, delightful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew they do a lot of behind the scenes
stuff that isn't hope ascetic at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think their, their karma is showing
them that I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, by being there,
I realized that maybe the core group is
[SPEAKER_02]: passionate and, and involved in really,
it is, it is their, their love of the life
[SPEAKER_02]: and their passion, but there's,
you know, there's a bigger situation
[SPEAKER_02]: behind it that's controlling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think they were necessarily
happy when I didn't want to make seeds for
[SPEAKER_02]: them when I just wanted to just do
straight design.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, over time just fell apart
and they had their karma to work through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized it just wasn't going in
the, in the direction I wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, we parted ways, you know,
and I'm still working the one line out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made for a burner, the lavender lemonade
skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's almost ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted at least, you know, I like to
always finish up my projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I say I'm going to make something
cool, I'm going to, I'm going to come
[SPEAKER_02]: through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I polished up a really unique phenol
that I'm calling Gen Z.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, kind of like the next
evolution of a skittles like plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so far it's, it's exceeded
all my expectations of smell, flavor,
[SPEAKER_02]: and also keeping through the cure and,
and the ability to create abundant amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll probably be the final thing
that you'll see that kind of like the
[SPEAKER_02]: closing chapter, but yeah, I, it was,
you know, my, my whole thing about extreme
[SPEAKER_02]: possibilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really thought it was a super F1 hybrid
between, between this amazing force and
[SPEAKER_02]: also my collection of unique genetics that
we could do something special,
[SPEAKER_02]: but maybe it was a lofty goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I know people really got
upset about it, but you know, I was
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking it's like, I also saw the writing
on the wall of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies doesn't have always the best rep,
but they're still part of our original
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're because, you know, all those guys,
they hustled, they grew there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all part came up in the Bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all were part of the same force that
was moving through time and space as
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now there's some forces that are
coming in there to get a completely level
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's like kind of like,
um, like the console of working with the
[SPEAKER_02]: Ewoks or something, you know, it's like
the bounty hunter and the, and the forest
[SPEAKER_02]: spirits working against the, uh,
the, the death star.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, I, I, I liked where it
was going.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't ever really work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I can, I can appreciate your point
of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, someone's got to get in there
and do the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess just, just to, uh, avoid anyone
saying, I, I didn't push hard enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: My interpretation of what you're saying is
that like burner and the inner crew,
[SPEAKER_00]: they seem cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seemed on board, but obviously
cookies as a company is much, much bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: than just burner and the inner crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just felt like there were sort of
forces at play that just weren't really
[SPEAKER_00]: working in your favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that sort of what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think just the national inertia of
the progress of the plan never panned out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was no, there was no,
like, what do they call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Proof of concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was never the ability.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was just, you know, I'd moved.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a few clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I offered up the Congo Kashmir clone as a,
as a, as the one, and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it it's an amazing train.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody loves it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if, if the public liked it as
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after that, not being able to pop more
seeds and to really do these hunts because
[SPEAKER_02]: there was no, you know, there was no,
there was no place for me to, to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't produce any new thing and there
was nothing really to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe it was just not meant to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it was a lofty goal and a great
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know, yeah, it just fell apart and
never, we never were, the plan never was
[SPEAKER_02]: realized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when it got to a point,
we just parted ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, look, I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I, I, I'm still grateful that you
tried to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always and always have been always
will be in support of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think trying to make a difference from
the inside is a valid tactic for anything
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to do really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on, on the topic, you know,
you sort of mentioned the, the Congo
[SPEAKER_00]: Kashmir in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our listeners, they sent in a
message saying, you know, I actually went
[SPEAKER_00]: to a cookie store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to try some.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, look, it's smoked really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was really surprised by how well it
sort of fit in as like a flower on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it didn't seem super out of
line and so much so that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really surprised sort of is what
they were saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that your experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it sort of look like cookies weed in
a sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that one of the reasons you handed it
over?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's it like to smoke that plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I'll start on Congo Kashmir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why we picked Congo Kashmir is
because it has one of the most unique and
[SPEAKER_02]: like really flavorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you would never expect it to be
an F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the way it looks and the way it
grows, maybe because it's very,
[SPEAKER_02]: it has, it's very vigorous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's very robust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, you know, it doesn't take longer
than nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was almost, it's really special.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had a few samples and that was the
one that agreed upon.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be an entryway because we also
had to, you can't just like drop in like
[SPEAKER_02]: some crazy heirloom plant into a cookies
facility because they don't always look
[SPEAKER_02]: that we had to create something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to create the, find the perfect
plant as a rainbow bridge to bring that
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer over to a new level of
appreciation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'd be open for future creation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, the Congo Kashmir has this
really lush, like it seems like it has
[SPEAKER_02]: almost every terpene you can imagine in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost kind of like, you know,
some of those like really hoppy ales that
[SPEAKER_02]: where they put like every known hop in
there to try and get them ultimate like a
[SPEAKER_02]: expression of citrus and like pine and,
and then what else?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like earth and gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just has like kind of everything
going for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's visually pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it doesn't look like a, you know,
it doesn't look kind of jungly,
[SPEAKER_02]: like some heirloom stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has really nice buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very crisply.
[SPEAKER_02]: It holds on the plant through the cure
very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has a really like functional yet up
high where someone that maybe is used to
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking, like the cookie style hybrids or
indica style plants, it's functional
[SPEAKER_02]: enough for them that it's not scary or
frightening or edgy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it, it's just kind of like having a
kind of cup of coffee after you add your
[SPEAKER_02]: like, whatever nightly six pack of
Heineken's or whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: for someone that likes to slow down after
work or to play video games or something,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just gave a little boost, a relax.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of like relax exercise,
you know, like when you're relaxed,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you can, but you want to exercise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that makes sense,
but I also like to call it like re alert,
[SPEAKER_02]: like relaxed yet alert.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a category on Kashmir.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be very terpy, re alert.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're, you know, that's outside of
the wheelhouse of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was the entry way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we had a lot of grandiose,
like I thought something was really going
[SPEAKER_02]: to happen, you know, and that's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like you said, all you can do is
try.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know a lot of people felt like I
sold out and this and that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't become a millionaire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't, I just got a, I don't know,
I got a basic monthly salary and I got to
[SPEAKER_02]: do basically pretty much not too much,
you know, to create something that never
[SPEAKER_02]: really happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think, you know,
maybe I'm praying that in the future that
[SPEAKER_02]: the bigger companies will pick up really
unique and special things as long as,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's the whole thing of the breeder,
the breeder, whether it be scientific,
[SPEAKER_02]: natural, whoever you are in your closet,
in your things out in the fields,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, yeah, I think it's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's what kind of, I really,
some of the, I really learned a lot and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I've, I respect for them,
even though I don't agree with the thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the things they do, the core and what
they, you know, they just happen to be put
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know even know what to think about
it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I'm happy for the experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I realized like it really taught me a lot
and it really taught me that the only way
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to really be able to kind of
change this environment of bottlenecking
[SPEAKER_02]: is by finding things that appeal.
[SPEAKER_02]: To the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also that these big facilities
can, can bump out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at this point, we're only,
you know, the people that are into it are
[SPEAKER_02]: into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know a good gonj.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know what's up, but most of the,
most of the States, most of the planet,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not planning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to just say most of the United
States doesn't really know what good gonja
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just know what's in the dispensary
and they've been force fed that it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: going to someone that's eating McDonald's
their whole life.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just, they want McDonald's.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, we have to make these new
plants that are going to fit in that mold,
[SPEAKER_02]: but have the ability to liberate them
from, uh, not only from the, the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the effects of the old stuff, but also the
person for pervasiveness, uh, that's it,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's, you know, inhabiting their
consciousness, this kind of purple
[SPEAKER_02]: glistening candy gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's great for, um, for doing stuff,
but there's a world out there that needs
[SPEAKER_02]: to be explored.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think it's a birthright to be
able to experience everything that the
[SPEAKER_02]: world has to give us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cannabis is a great part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, we, we've been talking a lot about
unique and special stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually got a really interesting
fan submitted question, which is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got so many magical plants in your
garden and you've given us some unique
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptions of past experiences,
but I'm wondering, what do you enjoy on a
[SPEAKER_00]: daily basis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you ever actually go back to something
repeatedly or is every time you smoke just
[SPEAKER_00]: something totally new?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I try and mix it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you like my wife is really into
Menehune.
[SPEAKER_02]: She really likes that out of the last ones
that we've been brewing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a, it's a new, I think that
gets released in a week or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the, it's a supernatural selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it's the Jim Ortega's old Hawaiian
clone crossed with the angel wing Afghan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes her like, it's just happy for
her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, um, there's a certain Fino,
one Fino is a little racy for her,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the other Fino just makes,
it's just kind of like a day brightener,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a, just a lifter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's, it's either friendly,
like you can go to sleep on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just kind of this kind of like all
around good vibe, kind of gonch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you think what else, uh,
stuff that I like to go back to,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I'm, I'm all always just,
things get old in the jars and I'm always
[SPEAKER_02]: trying new things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always just searching, you know,
when I used to have things hanging in at
[SPEAKER_02]: the old farm, we had a garage,
you know, we lived in the coastal fog
[SPEAKER_02]: layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had the perfect humidity door.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I could have things hanging for years
and they just only get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I would go back to certain
things for certain things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go out to music.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like do some goji or there was
that Rajasthani shikar that I would use,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, that I really loved that just kind of
listened to my day, like barely
[SPEAKER_02]: noticeable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I, the sativa is one I
wanted to get really out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, and really get psychedelic,
you know, go down to the dome and just
[SPEAKER_02]: trip out or listen to music.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I would really, I really kind of move
through stuff, but I think for right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: the stuff that I've gone back to more than
once was that congoji mana.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I also liked, um, I had some of
Jimmy's, um, it's, uh, uh, Lily,
[SPEAKER_02]: what is it called?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Lily of the Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff was really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my friend Reg makes, has this really
incredible black Chermoya one that I
[SPEAKER_02]: really, what I really liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried some, that Filipino I tried was
really dreamy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think of some of the ones
that recent notables, um, what's in my
[SPEAKER_02]: jars?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the main ones, um, that I can
think of that I've gone back to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there's this one called blue camphor
that I like a lot too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and it's a OG KB orgasmatron hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of, but that's going to be,
I'm hoping that one will make it into the
[SPEAKER_02]: nurseries.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has like a total blueberry camphor
taste and smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, I did like,
I'm making this, uh, I had a strain called
[SPEAKER_02]: lush.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a Lao pure Kush that was really
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've been using that one and back,
crossing it back into the pure Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm trying to make a pure Kush exactly
looking, tasting, um, growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: but growing with the vigor and the
strength of the Lao.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a super Kush, like, you know,
they're kind of like pure Kush is such an
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that Malibu, uh, Malibu PK,
like all that whole kind of family,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever the, um, but it's stringy and
it's kind of a pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying to create, uh, I'm almost
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm creating like, like the Arnold
Schwarzenegger version, like the more like
[SPEAKER_02]: pump you up, like strong with a little bit
more head high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one's been turning out nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been smoking different phenols of
that before, um, before we left the
[SPEAKER_02]: planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, I, and I was,
I, oh, I went through a serious dork out
[SPEAKER_02]: phase on the lavender lemonade Skittles
when I was trying to do that selection to
[SPEAKER_02]: go make the Gen Z higher Gen Z selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to go through a bunch of those,
which was okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they were really flavorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else or something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were the main ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, it sounds like you, uh, enjoy a
really nice variety, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: from between the, uh, the selection of the
Gen Z through to the, the dreamy Filipino
[SPEAKER_00]: land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, you're still really trying a wide
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds really, really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're on the topic, this will be our
last Patreon one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the one I actually had the most
people asking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now clear to me that I think
something has overtaken Goji as,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the most popular Bodhi strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, we're sort of skirting the
rules here a bit, but without a doubt,
[SPEAKER_00]: the deep line alchemy series has just
become just huge in its cult status and
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of following it's garnered over
the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people just wanted to hear you
talk a little bit about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's sort of your direction with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I guess sort of your,
your thoughts on why you released it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the various versions and, you know,
what's your favorite?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the dark horse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any, any plans to do anything further with
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the DLA it's such a, it kind of
took on a life of its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I, I don't have the,
that, the 88 G 13 hash plant anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have that mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was retired.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have like all my seed work on it and
all the different ways I took it in line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure I can find another mail,
but, uh, I've been kind of hunting for a
[SPEAKER_02]: new mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was thinking about like an HLA AL
like an ALA or an HLA, like it would be a
[SPEAKER_02]: airline, um, line alchemy or an ancient
line alchemy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I can't do DLA cause that's the
original.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, I mean, the, I would,
I really love the, that thing of allowing
[SPEAKER_02]: people to kind of, cause they know that
mail so well that when you pair it with
[SPEAKER_02]: something else, it's almost like this
ongoing, like, uh, like a teaching
[SPEAKER_02]: presentation where you can like,
it's interactive because it allows you to
[SPEAKER_02]: really experience that clone only like
special, uh, broadleaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think the bigger one up now is that,
uh, kind of try at it's the big J,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, angel wing artifact one male,
I think maybe the one, but it really needs
[SPEAKER_02]: some testing, but you know, it started
just as a way to, to get people turned on
[SPEAKER_02]: to some of these really cool old,
um, broadleafs, you know, and I,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, and the funny thing is I think the
second one was the first or second one was
[SPEAKER_02]: actually, it wasn't, it, I didn't use the
ADHD 13.
[SPEAKER_02]: May I use something else?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was, it kind of threw it off in
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also some unofficial DLAs like
there's wish mountain, which is the
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanistan, 88 G 13 hash point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's something that kind of,
there are actually our DLAs, but they
[SPEAKER_02]: snuck through to other ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish I could kind of recombine them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I'm just excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many cool plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of those plants I don't have
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of, there's a few DLAs
that were never even released.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there was a, the last one that kind
of only made about five packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just gave a few packs out was the DLA 17
or 18 or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the, uh, the SNL, the captain
Jack's Afghan, the smell of SNL,
[SPEAKER_02]: the one, the bud that they all smoked
during the beginning of Saturday night
[SPEAKER_02]: live, like I guess Dan Ackroyd and all
these guys, this is what they smoked
[SPEAKER_02]: before they would go out on, uh,
and, and, uh, film the earliest SNL.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I made that to anything,
but the mom was so worn out that the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds, the seed coats were flaking off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I couldn't really release it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I can only find like, you know,
I only found out of a huge bag that I
[SPEAKER_02]: made, I think I only found like 50 seeds
or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that one won't get, uh, released,
but maybe I'll do an F2 of that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's ones like, um,
I think that I don't think the M8,
[SPEAKER_02]: the hairspray, the LA hairspray Kush one
never made it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's one or two more that
didn't make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, the DLA, what are the cool
phenomenon?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the great thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm so stoked that people are like
F2ing them and getting them into and
[SPEAKER_02]: finding like, there's a way to like
finding their favorite DLA's because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're all so different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some of my favorite ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know like one that everyone loves is
I love the DLA four and five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I love the A1 because the very first
A1, cause it still had the really rank
[SPEAKER_02]: skunky stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love the DLA four, the cashmere one,
cause it was such a frosty cool plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I love, let's see, what are some of my
other favorite ones?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the DLA with the Lebanese is so
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, um, um, what else?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many, there's the Jalalabad.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the, you know what, the DLA with
the Kandahar black is really cool too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're also neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, it's almost like that just
kind of, it almost became its own thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it, you know, it's every time it's
like, it almost seems like there was a
[SPEAKER_02]: force behind it that was just working with
me or through me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like somehow a new DLA would always kind
of pop out, you know, and like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the new DLA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and you know, I'm so stoked that
people got into those and I'm really kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of sad that they're done, but I'm also
excited because people can F2 them and
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe I can F2 some of the ones that were
never released and maybe we can move into
[SPEAKER_02]: a new era.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking with this new triad male of
my three favorite Afghans, they all have
[SPEAKER_02]: such unique and beautiful traits in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by breaking it into threes,
I think there'll be a lot less dominant
[SPEAKER_02]: than the ADHD three turn 13 hash point.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only problem I felt like with
the DNA delays that was problematic is
[SPEAKER_02]: that male tended to be, uh, even though it
was awesome and it always brought a lot to
[SPEAKER_02]: the table, it was a little dominant,
you know, and originally the deal of the
[SPEAKER_02]: ADHD 13 hash point was a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a different male.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the deadly Gmail that I worked a
lot further into the future, but it became
[SPEAKER_02]: so dominant that I couldn't use it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to go back and find a less
dominant ADHD 13 flash point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the one that's used.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been used in almost everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, this DLA is such a, such a cool,
such a cool ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm so glad to kind of been along with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many cool plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost kind of like a history lesson
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I get to, cause you know,
when you have a chronological order and
[SPEAKER_02]: you get to see like, I remember the first
one and then, you know, through the years,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's all these different ones and it's
some of the plants they got and then the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that I lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just a really cool, it's just a
cool thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know anything quite like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I think it's developed such
a cult status and people will continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: dig into it, F to it, share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a, it's a testament to the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're onto the quick fire
questions to wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, we've got some new ones since
last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one I want to ask you is I'm
going to drop you off on a desert Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take either three clones or three
packs of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to take with you to
grow out forever?
[SPEAKER_02]: How big is the Island?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can segregate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't get any like, I have no pollen
clouds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can make sure everything stays.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Infinite, infinite resources to grow as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's super basic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would do like a CBD rich line,
you know, maybe like a, like Harlequin or
[SPEAKER_02]: something for health and harmony healing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just give me like a, just a
really nice Afghan and make, and just,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, a well-worked haze line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I can make just about
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which ones are going to be the seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, all the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they're all seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not risking clones on this Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just recreate everything with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next one is, uh, if you had to restart the
entire company, all of the companies with
[SPEAKER_00]: just one pack of seeds, which pack would
you take?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I would, you know, I would probably,
that's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would probably start it with like,
it's either goji or sunshine daydream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think goji I think I would like,
that's a great starting point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, it's just such a great feel good
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, sort of similar,
but slightly different without being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to know any details about the person.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's one strain of your work that you
would recommend that you just think,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, people are going to like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People will like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Congo Kashmir is pretty digestible
to just about anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, something that everybody would like
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to hit every kind of palette.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say Congo Kashmir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stand by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our final question for the interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your hope for the trajectory of
our community and industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: My hope for the trajectory of the
community and the thing is just to plant
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds, share those seeds, plant them
everywhere, inspire everybody,
[SPEAKER_02]: meet friends, meet, talk to plants,
don't talk to machines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just love each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Create pathways for learning communities,
get involved, get involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like go to the forums, make your own
things, make your own Facebook pages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, just network and just the key is
just to nourish this community to enter
[SPEAKER_02]: into and just really know that it's
special and it's so healing, not only for
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody involved, but for the entire
planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is the time to come together and
just let all bygones be bygones and know
[SPEAKER_02]: that, Hey, we're doing something really
magical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and it's so, it's so beneficial
for the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just, yeah, just be hopeful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I know things are hard right
now, but just find that niche,
[SPEAKER_02]: that thing that really turns you on and go
for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because whatever you do with your heart,
you know, is worth, is valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is worth, you know, that's,
I don't, I just be kind and plant seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a, what a fitting ending.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I think it just about brings
us to the end of it for this one.

make?
