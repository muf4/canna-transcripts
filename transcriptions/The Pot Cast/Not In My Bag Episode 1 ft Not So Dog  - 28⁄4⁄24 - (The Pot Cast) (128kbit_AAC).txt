yet first thing What are we all smoking on
[SPEAKER_01]: today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm smoking on some moonshine ghost train
haze I'm like first time I've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: actually had it brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am smoking on some chem D by maple leaf
indica I am testing out some phenos that
[SPEAKER_00]: my friend and I made and Yeah,
just kind of going through different
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghans and seeing what I think Been doing
this double limes number 10 clone that I
[SPEAKER_03]: got back from stunk tech from out of the
seeds was a super Lime leaning one,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's got a little bit of I don't know
it's real the soured up gives it a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit of an extra kick and I got the I just
busted out the old old bong my big tall
[SPEAKER_03]: bong Got it crystal clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked like it was fresh out of a head
shop, and it's it's hitting Definitely the
[SPEAKER_03]: goods right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I've been smoking on Beautiful
stuff beautiful stuff well Let's jump into
[SPEAKER_01]: it so our first story for today Let's chat
about our good friend burner Bernard
[SPEAKER_01]: recently released an interesting quote
quote where he stated I make zero dollars
[SPEAKER_01]: from weed It's all music and clothing all
that shit He specifically quoted that
[SPEAKER_01]: given cannabis is not federally legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot make proper money off it
However brands like clothing and rap is
[SPEAKER_01]: legal This begs the question What do we
think about that is that is that possible
[SPEAKER_01]: do we think burners lying is it even
remotely possible cookies is not making
[SPEAKER_03]: money You know I Wouldn't want to I
wouldn't want to assume that people are
[SPEAKER_03]: making more money than they would like to
let on but I've seen that before for sure
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely something that happens,
but at the same time You know I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: be surprised if most people who are As
close to profitable as they could get in
[SPEAKER_03]: the legal industry right now It's almost
like being able to stay afloat is the
[SPEAKER_03]: closest thing for a lot of a lot of
operations I think if you can like upgrade
[SPEAKER_03]: your lights, or you can expand to a new
Whatever it is whether it's a new property
[SPEAKER_03]: or something like that like I would
consider that to be pretty profitable
[SPEAKER_03]: right now to not just be losing money or
or You know going under or even like just
[SPEAKER_03]: barely breaking even It's really you know
it'd be hard to know but Like I said,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's definitely not unheard of to to
downplay your success as well,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know in the in the business,
so I Actually have some relatively deep
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts on that one And we could maybe go
back because I do think what he's saying
[SPEAKER_00]: is probably true If you go back to like
the very beginning of cookie He was sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of hired as like the hype man Right
because he had a bunch of like hip hop
[SPEAKER_00]: connections And he was gonna be sort of
like the face of cookie if you will Even
[SPEAKER_00]: back with like the original group of guys
that like we're starting to popularize it
[SPEAKER_00]: right and so one of the things they did
was like For him doing that he got to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to have a clothing company,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting thing about a clothing company
is that's just a normal business So you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get taxed like crazy with like you
don't have like the 280e and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions that Kana people have you
just have a clothing company So like if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're selling a hundred and eighty dollar
t-shirts made in and our sweatshirts and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff made in China Like that's pretty
profitable You know, so I bet the clothing
[SPEAKER_00]: part is probably more profitable than the
weed because it's way less taxed You know
[SPEAKER_00]: like having a Clothing company,
there's no special fees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most cannabis people you have to pay for
the right to be in the game Whether you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to have a store you want to have a
breeding facility you want to grow you
[SPEAKER_00]: literally you're not getting taxed on your
profit Although you get taxed on that too
[SPEAKER_00]: You get taxed just to enter into the game
to get the license to have the fees to do
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing right and the other thing I
would say about cookie and mean gene will
[SPEAKER_00]: probably agree is that like they're not
Trying to be like a small local California
[SPEAKER_00]: thing where like they're not too concerned
with profit yet I don't think they're
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned with expansion and I would
consider cookie to be one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that their whole game plan is to
get probably bought out by somebody big
[SPEAKER_00]: and so every new state that opens Whether
it's Florida and New York or New Jersey or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're opening flagship stores in those
new spots and that costs loot so they're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably more in like the investment
expansion mode then they're in and like
[SPEAKER_00]: the like what's the best way to put it
like, you know stacking cash mode and It's
[SPEAKER_00]: also possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I don't know anything like
personally a lot of like legitimate
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis people have been hired as sort of
like the front man for like bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: companies and Like they don't own nearly
as much as they say You know, so it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I wouldn't be surprised if cookie
isn't isn't making money because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: expanding so fast that They're probably
more like borrowing money to expand Right
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, he probably does make more
money off his albums and his clothes
[SPEAKER_00]: because those are lightly taxed and it
goes directly to him I bet there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of hands in the cookie jar if you will of
people that need to get paid You know
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's probably not a lot of hands
in his music or in his clothing thing
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I remember when I was a when I was a
kid people used to say, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the the Grateful Dead don't make money
from the shows and the Music they make
[SPEAKER_03]: money from the t-shirts and stickers,
you know Because it is really like that is
[SPEAKER_03]: something where you're like, okay this
little bit of money to make basically
[SPEAKER_03]: These little things and then because of
the branding they're worth a lot of money
[SPEAKER_03]: you're making This whatever 25 cent
sticker and it's five dollars and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: selling them everywhere and everybody has
one a lot of people who can't you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like I even experienced that myself a
little bit with like having boots that
[SPEAKER_03]: shows a lot of people would come who could
buy the t-shirt but they couldn't buy the
[SPEAKER_03]: packs of seeds or they could buy this the
sticker and they couldn't buy the t-shirt
[SPEAKER_03]: and so like it's definitely like having
something that's more accessible is good
[SPEAKER_03]: and in the world of Weed too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go ahead and box up the shirts if
you can sell them anywhere and it has been
[SPEAKER_03]: a really undeniably super popular brand as
far as Merchandising because I mean you
[SPEAKER_03]: can go pretty much anywhere and see
somebody with a cookies t-shirt You can
[SPEAKER_03]: look on TV and you'll see oh, there's a
guy right there on this show He's got
[SPEAKER_03]: wearing a cooking pad or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they did do well with that it's all a
really interesting thing to watch because
[SPEAKER_03]: um, I actually Have buddies who like
burner when he first started making music
[SPEAKER_03]: He started recording at my friend's studio
in in the bay at solidarity records And I
[SPEAKER_03]: remember I got the calendar from my
buddies and it's like on this month is
[SPEAKER_03]: this friend of mine This is this month is
this friend of mine and then a guy I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know a guy I'm like, who's this dude,
you know, and uh, and they were like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, it's this new dude burner You know,
he's he's got he's popping a little bit in
[SPEAKER_03]: the Bay Area and everything and that was
right around the time when people started
[SPEAKER_03]: to hear about Cookies people started
hearing about burner.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's interesting because now in like
retrospect everybody looks at it and goes
[SPEAKER_03]: oh they got the rapper and he popularized
the weed and I watched it as like more
[SPEAKER_03]: like I think the we popularized the rapper
because he was the guy who had it and it
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of was like Going feeding like a
feedback loop to where you know He met
[SPEAKER_03]: people and he's like look at this and
everybody's like whoa so when he started
[SPEAKER_03]: his rap career and He met people like Wiz
Khalifa and different people.
[SPEAKER_03]: He he was the one with that Bailey where
those guys were like Damn, what is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had the really good og like,
you know, like not so knows that point It
[SPEAKER_00]: was probably half half music and half
cookie promotion And it's still that way
[SPEAKER_00]: like even when when he does stuff in the
bay or they do events and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always when he's whenever he's like
whenever he's performing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always he brings the cookie van,
you know and And the and this and that and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all promoted and they they do a good
job of cross promotion You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't I basically think in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if any big cannabis companies
are making money yet I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're alive is a big win right
now I think they're burning investor money
[SPEAKER_00]: in the hopes that when they really when
the money really starts to come in all
[SPEAKER_00]: that investor money bought the market
share, but it's probably Not profitable
[SPEAKER_00]: right now You know The other thing that's
interesting about cookie is that as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm aware and I don't know if this is true
in other states But it's definitely true
[SPEAKER_00]: in California is they don't actually touch
weed Like all of the weed that they get is
[SPEAKER_00]: third-party contracts and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a clothing company and a store
Yeah, and this plays into the follow-up
[SPEAKER_01]: question I was gonna ask which is the
given they do have these business model of
[SPEAKER_01]: Outsourcing the productions to other
facilities other producers Could it
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly be that that accounts for a part
of why their profitability is down and as
[SPEAKER_01]: an extension of that idea?
[SPEAKER_01]: To what degree does this statement apply
to small businesses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that it is possible to still
be a small profitable dispensary slash
[SPEAKER_01]: producer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I I would say probably that the only way
to be profitable is to be small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think If you're big right now,
you're burning investor money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what mean gene things But I
have not heard of anybody raking in cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's huge They're almost all surviving
off infusions I mean in fact if I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: mistaken I think cookie and their invent
and their original investors just got into
[SPEAKER_00]: a fight over the last round of investment
that they all brought in You know and
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're trying to fund a bunch of
new businesses in new states And new
[SPEAKER_03]: stores and all that and that cost money,
you know Yeah, I mean to me I I agree like
[SPEAKER_03]: I've If I if somebody want like wanted to
start doing weed stuff and they're already
[SPEAKER_03]: doing some weed stuff but they were like
where's you know, where can you get in and
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever like I I have never felt like you
would Never felt like having a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: overhead and big ambition and doing All
that stuff is like the more easy win like
[SPEAKER_03]: we have huge investors and we're gonna do
all this stuff I've always looked at it
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, especially now I think
somebody who has just Something small that
[SPEAKER_03]: they can really keep the quality control
way up on to the point where people who
[SPEAKER_03]: get it can really Like it really resonates
with them where they get it and they go
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is really what I want to get
again and then you can build that
[SPEAKER_03]: organically and then maybe eventually You
could turn it into a bigger brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like that's more practical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think There's very few people who
could pull off what like what it What it
[SPEAKER_03]: appears that cookies the brand is able to
do regardless of whether or not those
[SPEAKER_03]: optics are accurate and all that quite
those questions, but I think you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that that is an easy thing
to do just In general from the logistics
[SPEAKER_03]: of it and the position in the market and
everything just the way everything is it's
[SPEAKER_03]: crazy But the big big big brand right now
The couple of them are the ones who are
[SPEAKER_03]: actually taking really pretty weed and
They're actually spraying it with how
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever kind of flavors and it's all fake
so you can get hazelnut macchiato you can
[SPEAKER_03]: get Fruit loops you can get lemon lime you
can get watermelon Probably whatever the
[SPEAKER_03]: hell it is and it's all fake But the weed
was pretty good weed when it started and
[SPEAKER_03]: then there when don't get me wrong
Sometimes it's horrible weed when they
[SPEAKER_03]: started but the very biggest of it is
where it's like actually like pretty like
[SPEAKER_03]: Oreos or lemon cherry gelato or whatever
it is and then they take it and they have
[SPEAKER_03]: a menu and it's like watermelon great You
know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said hazelnut whatever it is and
you smell it and you go whoa It smells
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly like the thing that's crazy And
that's always been crazy as a breeder when
[SPEAKER_03]: someone says this is great and it smells
like great This is lemon and you're like
[SPEAKER_03]: what actually smells like lemon peel I
thought you were gonna give me something
[SPEAKER_03]: that smelled like Like Jack or trainwreck
and I'd say no it just smells like those
[SPEAKER_03]: but then you smell it really smells like
lemon peel you go Oh, that's amazing but
[SPEAKER_03]: what they're doing now is they've realized
that that is really impressive and the way
[SPEAKER_03]: to get around it is by just doing that so
The guys who are making huge amounts of
[SPEAKER_03]: money right now are the guys who are
basically making a weed and It's the
[SPEAKER_03]: equivalent of having like, you know,
you go somewhere and you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's You know, that's orange soda
and it's sparkling water with orange
[SPEAKER_03]: squeezed in it cool but when somebody's
got corn syrup and artificial orange color
[SPEAKER_03]: and artificial orange flavor and you put
that together and you have an actual
[SPEAKER_03]: Bottle of soda that's like that's what
people go crazy over and both things are
[SPEAKER_03]: on the market But you can sell the hell
out of this new fake stuff and that funny
[SPEAKER_03]: enough People figured out that that was
the next thing to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this is a way to have success that
is is outside of what People had thought
[SPEAKER_03]: of doing and that to me was just
mind-blowing I was like kidding this was
[SPEAKER_03]: like a scam that you would do when you
were broke and you had to fake something
[SPEAKER_03]: and Like something that someone would do
back in the 80s or 90s and you'd be like I
[SPEAKER_03]: got this friend and he did this crazy But
it's what they're doing and that's the big
[SPEAKER_03]: brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only thing that's like bigger
right now that has more momentum than
[SPEAKER_03]: anybody is these brands that are doing
this and they have nice packaging and They
[SPEAKER_03]: have a product where when you open it and
you bought it and it said it was
[SPEAKER_03]: watermelon It's watermelon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas breeders are sitting here trying
to make yeah, it's like watermelon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can see it I can see if that's oh,
that's really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys are just like no they put it in
this big thing almost like an oven or
[SPEAKER_03]: refrigerator or freeze-dryer type thing a
big thing and it basically just Fogs it
[SPEAKER_03]: with all these, you know, whatever it is
and it turns it into that wheat and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: like the next thing that's really big and
so anyway, that's the only thing that I
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen that has been the next step of
going oh wow, that's even more popular
[SPEAKER_03]: because a couple of the brands are really
killing it right now, especially in New
[SPEAKER_03]: York and on the East Coast and you know,
there's like certain whole markets where
[SPEAKER_03]: that just dominates and the buds that they
roll in the THC a You know, and it looks
[SPEAKER_03]: like a powdered donut or it looks like
whatever and I just look at it and go It's
[SPEAKER_03]: just a new kind of moon rock basically,
which has always been garbage to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those are those little gimmicks And
you know, they've managed to do do good
[SPEAKER_03]: off of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's like the new thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the big the big thing but you know
other than that, it's like I don't see
[SPEAKER_03]: getting established and having a big brand
having a big I think it would be better to
[SPEAKER_03]: get established and have something really
small and then if you can get a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: more people to appreciate it grow it
organically at this point because it just
[SPEAKER_03]: seems it seems so hard to To you know have
any kind of market share Nobody wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: admit it and we can all debate on what
size it starts at But there is a size upon
[SPEAKER_00]: which at least till this point everything
above that size of grow produces mids
[SPEAKER_00]: Right and so what He was just describing
is basically in my mind it's like how do
[SPEAKER_00]: we polish this turd we have This sea of
mids and it's not very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, it's not very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tried all this different stuff Okay,
like I think I'm pretty good at growing
[SPEAKER_00]: weed now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing acres now I'm growing 800
lights now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing this or that and honestly,
my weed is not that great Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so what they're doing in order to pump
that weed from not that great into
[SPEAKER_00]: something desirable is All the things that
you just heard about roll it in THC a roll
[SPEAKER_00]: it in Keith spray it with fake turps You
know get packaging everything that's
[SPEAKER_00]: making it like not about the quality of
the weed itself Because they don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: have that to stand on and so what's common
now is like buying weed in colored Mylar's
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can't even see what's inside it
until you've already made your purchase so
[SPEAKER_00]: the branding and the and the artwork and
Just like he's saying the nose when you
[SPEAKER_00]: open the bag It's all everything but the
weed because the thing that we haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: figured out yet is we've got more people
have more Control and more data than they
[SPEAKER_00]: ever have and they're getting really
really good at growing weight But the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality is going down on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Would say you know it really is and so
now they're trying to figure out a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: polish that and to get Excitement onto
something about not the weed because
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody wants to admit that No,
we're blowing this thing up and our weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not that good It just isn't and
so and so that's the problem With scale
[SPEAKER_00]: right now with anything big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, is that I mean, you know,
he'll tell you back in the day even a
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,000 square foot That today is
considered tiny and legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a big row in Mendo I Mean if you
were trying to get away with a quarter
[SPEAKER_00]: acre, you know, like, you know You
probably weren't doing it all in one spot
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably had a patch here and a patch
there and this and that and da da da da
[SPEAKER_00]: and you tried to break it up a little bit
and not just make it and So now with these
[SPEAKER_00]: mega farms, they've just flooded it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just endless amounts of cheap boof
in my opinion You know, it's almost like
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what it reminds me of is a
mirror.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it American Beasters Because it be
literally because Canada DC bud was like
[SPEAKER_00]: America's first taste of like super high
EC grown for weight grown for looks
[SPEAKER_00]: Commercially grown warehouse weed it grown
at scale packaged and sold to be cheap and
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what we've gotten pretty
good at and legal and a lot of like the
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, everybody throws around craft as
a term, but it's basically just like You
[SPEAKER_00]: know treating your herb nicely at every
stage and then hoping you get a little
[SPEAKER_00]: something special at the end That's being
lost in the chase for money at the moment
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's not really a discerning or a
way to grade or label it where People can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell the difference very easily So a lot
of times the best way gets buried and the
[SPEAKER_01]: sea emits No, that that's such a pertinent
point and for the longest time people have
[SPEAKER_01]: discussed the idea of who's gonna be the
cause light of Cannabis, you know who's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be the the bulk for the masses and I
guess I wonder is this it have we reached
[SPEAKER_01]: it is it gonna be the artificial turps is
for the masses and the the craft brew
[SPEAKER_01]: equivalent is like actual real cannabis
with those legitimate turps Yeah the parts
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just say one thing and then I'll let
homie speak the part that bothers me the
[SPEAKER_00]: most about all this stuff is That when it
comes to flower or say like basic kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: hashish We have decades and decades of
like testing and experience that shows
[SPEAKER_00]: like good and bad what it does to people
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what all these artificial
turps infused like he's saying in a cloud
[SPEAKER_00]: a cloud of artificial Whatever is being
sprayed on pounds to infuse them with
[SPEAKER_00]: these watermelon Tangy gelat like flavors
of different things like that's never been
[SPEAKER_00]: tested long term being combusted we don't
know if it's like you remember when
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody found out that like smoking dabs
when it's when the the banger is like 950
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees is actually carcinogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Wouldn't be surprised that people found
out that these like artificially flavored
[SPEAKER_00]: turp weed is Isn't the healthiest option
compared to just actual weed You know find
[SPEAKER_03]: out like, you know, it's like do you read
do you remember in the In the not the I
[SPEAKER_03]: guess it was pretty much the original the
original Batman movie when it when the
[SPEAKER_03]: Joker starts selling all the all the weird
shit and it starts turning everyone into
[SPEAKER_03]: the Joker because the weird combination
the chemicals like if you know about
[SPEAKER_03]: chemistry, there's all this weird stuff
where it's like If you have this thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's fine with this thing and it seems
like natural natural weed it like for
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever reason there's the good luck of
all it produces hundreds and hundreds of
[SPEAKER_03]: chemicals and they all They all work good
together and it's not a big deal,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know But a lot of things if you burn
several different chemicals together or
[SPEAKER_03]: heat them up There's certain reactions and
you don't know what they are and so if
[SPEAKER_03]: people start Doing things with this weird
artificial stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like we don't really know what All
that is gonna do and I'm not like
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly scared, but there's potential
there where it's like Think about it just
[SPEAKER_00]: in recent history.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was all those people that ended up
with lung problems because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: additives they were putting into the pens
to help with the viscosity and It started
[SPEAKER_00]: do you remember I mean, you know,
I can't remember exactly what it was But
[SPEAKER_00]: there was definitely people that were
getting their lungs messed up And getting
[SPEAKER_00]: medical conditions and it turned out
because they were adding like vitamin E
[SPEAKER_00]: acetate and this and that and they had to
ban that stuff I mean I mentioned the
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry glowing banger But when people
first started doing dabs in the modern era
[SPEAKER_00]: All my friends were dropping their dabs
into glowing cherry bangers until they
[SPEAKER_00]: found out that a lot of turps at those
temps produce cyanide and arsenic and
[SPEAKER_00]: other compounds that you probably don't
want to be inhaling and You know along
[SPEAKER_00]: with your herbs so I would not be
surprised if something that makes my weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: smell like watermelon Kiwi Isn't the
healthiest thing to combust and draw into
[SPEAKER_03]: my lungs on a regular basis I could be
some people might be just basically using
[SPEAKER_03]: like air fresheners like Freshner shit you
put in your car like we don't really know
[SPEAKER_03]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as it's an additive you're like,
well, what's the added it some of these
[SPEAKER_03]: could be like Good like botanical things
that are extracted from real stuff Some of
[SPEAKER_03]: them could even be cannabis based terpenes
like I wouldn't think it was that bad if
[SPEAKER_03]: someone said oh I'm gonna go ahead and
take this Fraction off of like your cherry
[SPEAKER_03]: limeade and I'm gonna go ahead and soak
this weed in it and make pre rolls out of
[SPEAKER_03]: it or do whatever like it's like yeah,
you're just kind of up in the numbers and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're these different things that are
natural, but I also wouldn't be surprised
[SPEAKER_03]: if there's people who Are literally taking
like going?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, this is this we're just gonna
put Bucking air wick in this pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's crazy now, you know I mean,
I know people have at certain times used
[SPEAKER_03]: things that are like that just to make
weed smell like whatever because people
[SPEAKER_03]: are like smells different and now it has a
smell it's definitely been done in the old
[SPEAKER_03]: days and I'm sure a lot of this stuff is
just kind of Random and not really very
[SPEAKER_03]: well vetted as far as what it is Or where
it's sourced, you know, even if they tell
[SPEAKER_03]: you they might tell you it's cannabis
derived They might tell you it's botanical
[SPEAKER_03]: or it's fruit based or whatever it is,
but then it's like yeah, but What are you
[SPEAKER_03]: where where's the quality control?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is their customers are guinea
pigs in my opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they are They're guinea pigs
and since weed has fought so long to like
[SPEAKER_00]: get a basic amount of respect and
understanding where it's not like this
[SPEAKER_00]: horrible devil thing Taking all the tried
and true tested stuff and setting it aside
[SPEAKER_00]: for this like new new that's completely
Untested and has a bunch of funk because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to basically pretty up the
fact that you grew a bunch of bad weed You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, I mean that like honestly in in
Mendo and I'm not gonna like This is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the reason why most people grow
good weed is not only because they like to
[SPEAKER_00]: good weed But because they wanted the
brokerage To be like yes, I like this I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take it off you So like if you
did a really good job, it just made
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else in your life that much
easier Everyone was happy you're happy the
[SPEAKER_00]: brokers happy the people the broker giving
it to her happy Everyone's happy all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way along down the line because the
quality is there if you didn't grow good
[SPEAKER_00]: weed You might have to sit on it You know
and then you're not happy because you sat
[SPEAKER_00]: on it so You know now they're trying to
figure out ways to market bad weed That's
[SPEAKER_01]: it right I'm sure almost certain that
we're gonna have further deep dives into
[SPEAKER_01]: the sprayed terms It's hard to believe
this is just a tangent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like a whole topic in and of
itself But I think what not so dog said is
[SPEAKER_01]: pertinent, you know I think as time goes
by more stuff is going to come to the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface and will yet it's yet to be seen
as to whether it's entirely safe and what
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of repercussions there might be
associated with it, but while I'm on the
[SPEAKER_01]: topic not so dog you actually Predicted
perfectly what the next discussion point
[SPEAKER_01]: is which is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookies parent company is being sued by
cookies retail LLC So in a recent news
[SPEAKER_01]: story by MJ biz daily published by Chris
Roberts It covers that how cookies the
[SPEAKER_01]: parent company is being sued for a hundred
million dollar dispute They claim that
[SPEAKER_01]: burner aka Gilbert Milan who the
co-founder of cookies parent company
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed the brand And products any images
to other companies such as cookies retail
[SPEAKER_01]: LLC They alleged that the cookies parent
company failed to register itself as a
[SPEAKER_01]: franchise Which was required by state and
federal law and as a result of doing this
[SPEAKER_01]: they were able to withhold certain
information about their finances Cookies
[SPEAKER_01]: retail LLC alleges that the parent company
also heavily over inflated the
[SPEAKER_01]: profitability of the company as well as
minimize the ongoing expenses of operating
[SPEAKER_01]: a store they Report they were forced to
pay for clothing and cannabis products
[SPEAKER_01]: that they were sent but never requested or
ordered and they also report that they
[SPEAKER_01]: have invested over a hundred million
dollars to set up 33 different stores
[SPEAKER_01]: across the USA and are seeking damages of
the same amount due to poor profitability
[SPEAKER_01]: overall Bernard declined to comment on the
case however seems pretty concerning that
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the most popular brands in the
industry May not be as profitable as it
[SPEAKER_01]: seems on the surface The case alludes that
there may have been a degree of
[SPEAKER_01]: misappropriation of the funds so that may
be a factor in at all But I guess overall
[SPEAKER_01]: it seems that cookies may in fact not be
as profitable as it once seemed or may at
[SPEAKER_01]: least appear How does this affect the
industry and as a follow-up?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does this mean for people like say
the jungle boys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need to wonder are they maybe not as
profitable as they seem is everyone maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: not as profitable as they seem or is this
Maybe a cookies exclusive issue
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would say I don't think I don't
think very many people are profitable as
[SPEAKER_00]: we spoke about before I think a lot of
these big companies Their entire business
[SPEAKER_00]: model is hoping that it goes federally
legal and they get bought out You know and
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that people thought they were
going to get rich quick and you know I I
[SPEAKER_00]: think there was a lot of excitement four
or five years ago That there was just
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be this vast amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean they were talking about oh,
it's gonna be bigger than alcohol It's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be like worth 30 40 50 billion a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be this massive thing and I
think people thought that they were going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get rich quick and Weed has always been
sort of a day-to-day grind where if you
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're doing if you want to do a
good job at it You kind of have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent And I think people are
realizing that they're not gonna get rich
[SPEAKER_00]: quick I Don't have a lot of sympathy for a
bunch of rich investors that tried to dive
[SPEAKER_00]: into our world and steal it from us So I
don't feel bad that they're not making the
[SPEAKER_00]: type of money that they thought they were
with their investment You know Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you think about it, dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean that's I Don't yeah,
I don't I don't see it being like In
[SPEAKER_03]: general the whole the whole deal of it
everything being legalized and regulated
[SPEAKER_03]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not You can look at like services or
products or whatever as whatever is gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: be whatever is gonna do the best is what's
really Useful and what's really necessary,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you look at like You look at like the
post office and you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well Amazon is like You know a lot of
people think of like Amazon like it's this
[SPEAKER_03]: thing where You buy things from Amazon and
Amazon's the one who sells it to you But
[SPEAKER_03]: really Amazon is like another post office
now They do have things they sell but for
[SPEAKER_03]: the most part when you buy something from
Amazon, you're buying it from a different
[SPEAKER_03]: seller So something like Amazon is this
really valuable product they bring value
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like okay this company should do
really good because it's something that
[SPEAKER_03]: okay Everybody can really use it basically
anything you want to get it's there You
[SPEAKER_03]: know So naturally, it's gonna be super
profitable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna make tons of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well Everybody wants weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course weed is gonna be super
profitable But nobody needs regulated weed
[SPEAKER_03]: and nobody needs legal weed it wasn't
necessary Nobody needs a shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody can get weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like naturally they're at a huge
disadvantage by trying to have this huge
[SPEAKER_03]: System set up for everybody to make
billions and billions of dollars when it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody was already making billions and
billions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't like there Yeah, there wasn't
the post office and then there is Amazon
[SPEAKER_03]: but Amazon has a service that the post
office can't provide but regulated weed at
[SPEAKER_03]: the store it only can provide a service to
a certain little slice of people who
[SPEAKER_03]: bought but will buy weed at the store,
but there was already So many billions of
[SPEAKER_03]: dollars being spent on weed and there was
no stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously the store wasn't really
Necessary so it's like the store is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like this Kind of a useful little I
would actually say that the stores are a
[SPEAKER_00]: barrier Right like legitimately and and
what I mean by that is that I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually view I Don't actually view weed
is legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe maybe that's like controversy or
whatever, but like I think if herb was
[SPEAKER_00]: legal then small growers should be able to
sell direct to customers within our state
[SPEAKER_00]: right and I think part of the problem is
that in order for people to go grow good
[SPEAKER_00]: weed it has to not only go through
distribution but it has to get into a
[SPEAKER_00]: store and most of those places aren't Like
They're not making the decisions on the
[SPEAKER_00]: best weed they can get they're making the
decisions on what the most profitable for
[SPEAKER_00]: them You know, and so there's a lot of
corruption in that regard to like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole payola scandal that's gone on in
California where for a while it was You
[SPEAKER_00]: had to pay for shelf space For a lot of
these stores, right where it's like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not only they're they're gonna buy your
stuff I want you to pay I have limited
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to pay me for some of that shelf
space because there's big companies with
[SPEAKER_00]: rich investors that are paying me for an
advantage and what what you read I think
[SPEAKER_00]: is investors getting frustrated that weed
has become a worse investment than them
[SPEAKER_00]: just putting their money in Treasury bonds
or any other kind of stock like they
[SPEAKER_00]: poured all this money in and Not only are
they not profiting, but they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the money back out and they're mad
Because a lot of these big I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a there's a crew up here in in our
neck of the woods called Flo Khanna and
[SPEAKER_00]: They raised 250 million dollars and then
this past year they shuttered like all
[SPEAKER_00]: their Kana operations so they already blew
through a quarter of a billion dollars and
[SPEAKER_00]: Weren't able to make enough money even to
stay functioning Right and so You know
[SPEAKER_00]: like when you like for instance when
cookies raised money when you Raise money
[SPEAKER_00]: that that amount of money you're giving
away a percentage of your company to raise
[SPEAKER_00]: the money Right like they're investing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not just like that's what they're
getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting some kind of percentage
some kind of stock percentage Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you were blowing it up as far as
profitability, you wouldn't need outside
[SPEAKER_00]: funding Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the game right now in big legal weed is
all these people are pouring in large
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of money hoping to gain market
share and then They're getting mad when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not as promised Because there's all
these dudes like oh, yeah, give me the
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take that hundred million dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make us all rich and Then five years
later, they lost it and they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, I did get a fat salary and I bought
a couple of houses Before this thing went
[SPEAKER_00]: bunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll actually do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, people made good money I was just
thinking it was funny like can you imagine
[SPEAKER_03]: if you just had a quarter billion dollars
and you just like let's just take a
[SPEAKER_03]: quarter billion dollars and let's just
like Blow up some some bootleg shit like
[SPEAKER_03]: we're just gonna take a quarter billion
dollars and start an online THC a shipping
[SPEAKER_03]: Operation like profitable you could be
with that much money How many people could
[SPEAKER_03]: be actually working in some kind of an
organization versus?
[SPEAKER_03]: Locano where they basically had like one
warehouse with a bunch of weed from a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of these that they ended up not
being able to pay and they just Popped the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole thing like it's so much Resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean in my in my opinion Cookies
entire play is when weed goes federally
[SPEAKER_00]: legal They want some big group to look at
the fact that they've got all these stores
[SPEAKER_00]: in California and Florida New York this
that everything else and they're like
[SPEAKER_00]: we're just going to buy into this new
profitable industry and This is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most desirable companies and then
everybody that owns stock and it makes out
[SPEAKER_00]: like a bandit But they have to get there
and I think I even think you know he brags
[SPEAKER_00]: about like You know somebody offered to
buy cookies for like some 800 million or
[SPEAKER_00]: something and they turned it down That
might have been a bad move on their part
[SPEAKER_00]: because that was still when hope was high
and reality hadn't set in and The reality
[SPEAKER_00]: is is that somehow?
[SPEAKER_00]: This quasi legal weed situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have took an extremely profitable 215
and made life worse for almost everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I mean I just can't help but
look at it in that light of going Okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: yes, here's this thing and it's so it's
worth so much money.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so profitable It's such a great
business and at the same time look at it
[SPEAKER_03]: and go yeah, but this aspect of it It's
like yeah weed is super profitable Legal
[SPEAKER_03]: weed is super profitable But all said and
done after this smoke clears or the dust
[SPEAKER_03]: settles or however you want to say it is
Really the regulated market is there any
[SPEAKER_03]: real utility to it like in reality?
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody can easily grow weed trade weed
sell weed buy weed It that you don't like
[SPEAKER_03]: even if you like say you want to sell ice
cream, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to have like a storefront that is
an ice cream shop Like I'm gonna I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: be hogging dolls or I'm gonna be Baskin
Robbins.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a storefront I need one in every
city because I need to have a Freezer and
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to put my ice cream in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna be a burger place I need to have
a place where there's a place to drive up
[SPEAKER_03]: and pay for the burgers I need a fryer for
french fries.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need refrigerators for all my stuff I
need employees that'll make all the stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to do all this stuff Weed is like
you really don't need a storefront for
[SPEAKER_03]: weed when you look like you look at the
cookie store And there's this wall full
[SPEAKER_03]: all this weed like bro I can stick all
that shit in a backpack in the trunk like
[SPEAKER_03]: you can pull up and it's weed it just
isn't like there's Not that much utility
[SPEAKER_03]: in the legal market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great to have storefronts because
distribution is huge and anybody who is
[SPEAKER_03]: like a weed grower back in the day would
go Oh if we had stores in every city and
[SPEAKER_03]: we could just sell weed there Yeah,
that would be great but if it costs a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of money the amount of investment
that it really takes and the actual
[SPEAKER_03]: utility of the whole marketing empire you
kind of look at it and you go It's cool,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I don't think it's cool on a level of
Investing a quarter billion dollars on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might have been a lot better to go
Okay, how do we keep this stripped down to
[SPEAKER_03]: the point where we're basically?
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazon you know what I mean, like it's
just very basic and their utility is there
[SPEAKER_03]: but instead everything is like on this
thing like it's this big Showcase for
[SPEAKER_00]: everything one thing we should say too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be limited Because it's a
state-by-state model Nobody has any plan
[SPEAKER_00]: for the inevitable overproduction that
happens Right whatsoever and so there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no real like like balance between
how many people can get licenses because
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to give the state so much money
to get started that they're down to accept
[SPEAKER_00]: it so anyone that wants to get started
that has the funding and they can go
[SPEAKER_00]: through the process can get it as long as
you're willing to shell it out and
[SPEAKER_00]: California way over every state ends up
over producing and then that excess seems
[SPEAKER_00]: to magically find its way all over the
rest of the country You know, so cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you trying to say?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you trying to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Insinuating I'm saying I'll say it
straight out 90% the legal market is the
[SPEAKER_00]: is almost the entire market now And what I
mean by that is that the big legal farms
[SPEAKER_00]: they supply all the weed for the legal
market and their oversupply is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of the black market and that's why our
area is hurting so bad is that like all of
[SPEAKER_00]: their overage like you type in Canada
destroys weed and Like in Google will pop
[SPEAKER_00]: up like they destroy probably 25% of their
crop a year because it gets too old and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's unsold There is no unsold weed in
California It just disappears You know and
[SPEAKER_03]: so right now small people the small
producers for some reason have all this
[SPEAKER_00]: extra weed that they can't sell though But
the big producers the people with acreage
[SPEAKER_00]: and a thousand lights or whatever It all
just disappears for some reason the guy
[SPEAKER_03]: who has 30 extra pounds He cannot find
anything to do with it like locally at the
[SPEAKER_03]: stores, but the guys who grow 26 million
pounds of weed every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, yeah, I don't know,
you know these stores It's shit hot right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like yeah our operation and then
New York is complaining because every
[SPEAKER_00]: other bodega in New York City has Branded
Mylard, California weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, so in a weird way
legalization has created the largest
[SPEAKER_00]: domestic black marketeers that has ever
existed and Everybody's turning a blind
[SPEAKER_00]: eye to it because those large farms they
give so much money to the state to exist
[SPEAKER_00]: every year Upfront has nothing to do with
profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about like per license.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a fee and then there's all these
other fees So some of these big farms are
[SPEAKER_00]: paying, you know, they're paying hundreds
of thousands to a few million a year of
[SPEAKER_00]: investor money just to exist and that
seems to be a Massive paper shield and now
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got now you've got people like it's
not just like that You know that catalyst
[SPEAKER_00]: CEO guy, you know from the stores in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people that are starting to scream
About okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well these people own they do a hundred
acres of greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does it all go?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like the Emperor has no
clothes nobody wants to talk about you
[SPEAKER_00]: know That aspect so in my I guess what I
would say is that the current rules in the
[SPEAKER_00]: current situation We've kind of danced
around it whether it's taxes the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worked horrible It's been really bad
for the legacy people that existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been really bad for consumers Because
I'll guarantee you in 215 you could get
[SPEAKER_00]: cheaper and better quality weed from most
dispensaries Then you can get today.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it's bad for the producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bad for the consumers It's bad for
the investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not making any money Right,
like that's why they're people don't file
[SPEAKER_00]: lawsuits because they're doing well with
their money They file lawsuits when they
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like they got taken advantage of
Right, that's the story That you were
[SPEAKER_03]: reading about yeah, and the regulation was
was proposed a lot differently,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know There was a lot of protections
that were supposed to be put in place in
[SPEAKER_03]: California That just got stepped right
over like it wasn't you know I always knew
[SPEAKER_03]: that even if you put a cap on how much
people can grow They'll just put the other
[SPEAKER_03]: ones and other people's names and people
will get around it But they didn't even
[SPEAKER_03]: make people have to do that It was like
you're only gonna be able to grow this
[SPEAKER_03]: much and then they were like, yeah screw
it We'll just you can grow whatever You
[SPEAKER_03]: want and the whole thing, you know,
the whole thing got completely done
[SPEAKER_03]: different I mean Gavin Newsom came up and
we're gonna make sure everything's really
[SPEAKER_03]: good for the small farmers and everything
and then you know One thing I've noticed
[SPEAKER_00]: about these questions is that we could
really go on for a long time about any one
[SPEAKER_00]: of them Switch to the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be cool, too That's exactly it
well I was gonna say without going Too
[SPEAKER_01]: deep down the rabbit hole I think the
logical conclusion to this discussion is
[SPEAKER_01]: as we've talked about, you know It seems
like the game plan for cookies as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: other big companies is set themselves up
in a prime position for federal
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization The question though is do we
expect that to happen before they blow
[SPEAKER_01]: through the cash?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the downfall of cookies possibly gonna
occur due to that plan not being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: be fulfilled with legalization?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's been a part of their
internal meetings Someone's sweating about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah cash cash burn versus that's why they
raised a bunch of new money and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: partially getting sued because those
initial investors thought that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: getting diluted out from their position on
the new money rates You know, so it is
[SPEAKER_00]: it's about you know right now the industry
is that's and that is distorting
[SPEAKER_00]: everything a bunch of rich investor money
propping up unprofitable businesses is
[SPEAKER_00]: Affecting the ability for smaller
businesses to be profitable Because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not competing against other people
that are doing better than them They're
[SPEAKER_00]: just competing against people that are
funded to lose Yeah, it's it's it's
[SPEAKER_03]: ruining that it's ruining what is all the
big potential and then what you know a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of people just suspect like alright and It
is the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like okay Well, if we can just lose
money lose money lose money until
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody fails Then we'll be the last
ones but what a lot of people didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: anticipate was that they would lose a lot
more money than they thought and they
[SPEAKER_03]: actually lost money until they failed
which is crazy because it's like they're
[SPEAKER_03]: like, okay Well, we'll just you know,
keep doing this and we'll we'll kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: undermine the whole thing and it's like
yeah, but now you undermine Things so
[SPEAKER_03]: badly that it doesn't have any There's no
there's nothing practical left,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and that's definitely what
what's been going on, you know You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it could change when things become more
realistic, but we're not sure you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's Certainly I think we could muse on
it all day So why don't we flick for
[SPEAKER_01]: something a little more light-hearted?
[SPEAKER_01]: This one actually just one I remembered on
the fly, but I want to touch on to it
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently we saw the slightly unexpected
partnering of Mike Tyson with royal queen
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds Talking about money getting into the
industry or maybe getting into It Mike
[SPEAKER_01]: Tyson notably has the ranch where he
produces cannabis haven't heard anything
[SPEAKER_01]: about it whether it's good or bad But I
guess the question is do we expect to see
[SPEAKER_01]: more celebrities jumping on the cannabis
corporate bandwagon Making their own seed
[SPEAKER_01]: lines or do we think this might be a
little short-lived any thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: I Would not I would if I had to wildly
guess I would say he's just buying seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: from someone making them and branding them
himself You're a hundred percent now that
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the seeds he's offering is gelato
41 auto Though notably there are one or
[SPEAKER_01]: two strains that have nice little
References in the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got punch pie I guess a reference to
punching and then we've also got a goat
[SPEAKER_01]: Lado Which is just a gelato 41 auto,
but I guess you know in his honor sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: thing I mean, you know, that's the thing
about when you take something and you
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring it into Being mainstream is you're
naturally gonna get all that type of
[SPEAKER_03]: branding you know what I mean,
like you're gonna have like the Whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like he wanted if it was when I
was a kid It would be like the he-man
[SPEAKER_03]: strain like oh, it's he-man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the classic joke like in space balls
Like it's it's space balls the
[SPEAKER_03]: flamethrower.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's space balls, you know the lunchbox
that's whatever like the The the the you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, the cross branding is like,
okay Well, we make cereal but like you'd
[SPEAKER_03]: probably sell a lot better if we put Mike
Tyson on the box And so when you got
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody like it's royal queen seeds,
it's not even like Mike Tyson started a
[SPEAKER_03]: seed company Royal Queen is just like
we're making them like Tyson line They're
[SPEAKER_03]: just putting Mike Tyson on the front of
the Wheaties box, you know So like it's
[SPEAKER_03]: naturally gonna happen and I think it's
gonna happen a lot more the only thing is
[SPEAKER_03]: in some cases like at least like like Mike
Tyson is like stone to the bone 24-7 like
[SPEAKER_03]: smokes a lot of dope and he has forever,
you know, he's like been a smoker since
[SPEAKER_03]: way way back and There's a lot of
different people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure who we're gonna do it and you're
like wait Do you did were you ever into
[SPEAKER_03]: weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this is the you know, we're gonna
have the Gwyneth Paltrow Vagina scented
[SPEAKER_03]: vape or like what it what's the next
thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where it's just gonna get ridiculous,
but at least in the case of like Tyson
[SPEAKER_03]: like with the weed branding stuff It's
like he smokes he's into weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like at least he's probably
gonna have like some stony pot Whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever is going on there, you know And
you know, I don't see like a huge issue
[SPEAKER_03]: with it as far as that but I'm sure that
we're gonna start to see it where it
[SPEAKER_03]: starts to get really really ridiculous
where you're like Where is the where's the
[SPEAKER_03]: overlay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Lap here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what does this have to do with any of
the weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you if you know Tyson a
little bit, you know, like he really he's
[SPEAKER_03]: always high He's just like he just smokes
all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's never sober He said he used to box
all his fights stoned on weed Like all
[SPEAKER_03]: those crazy fights that you saw when we
were kids is like he was stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, alright, well Shit,
you know, it's at least there's that you
[SPEAKER_03]: know But as far as like seeds and then it
makes a little bit less sense Because what
[SPEAKER_03]: what's the point and then you look at it
and you're like, okay punch is probably
[SPEAKER_03]: like a purple punch cross But but it's
Tyson so let's use the purple punch,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know And it's you can just picture the
guys sitting around in the in the
[SPEAKER_03]: boardroom, you know going well I mean we
got the we got the we we gave him the
[SPEAKER_03]: money to use his name So like what do you
think we'll use the let's call it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know One punch knockout and it'll be
wedding cake with purple punch and it'll
[SPEAKER_03]: be you know This is gonna be the kids are
gonna love it guys, you know, and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: why I can put it in a hula hoop and It's
just bullshit craziness.
[SPEAKER_03]: But uh, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all it's all interesting But I but
I'm curious to see what like the next
[SPEAKER_03]: level of it is where and I know it's
already out there and I'm probably not
[SPEAKER_03]: noticing it like I said with like,
you know, like with these celebrities
[SPEAKER_03]: where it has nothing to do with anything
and then the idea is really weird and I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean, it'll probably be really funny to
laugh at when you're really high and just
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to scratch your head You know,
this is the Bill Cosby Indica or you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like what the fuck are they doing here?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I get a lot of it is what you're
saying, but I Think part of it is just
[SPEAKER_00]: that because weed is coming out of the
shadows for the first time It doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: any established it has tens of millions Of
regular users in the United States people
[SPEAKER_00]: who smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a massive market there Which
the new which they want to fill but there
[SPEAKER_00]: are no like any other kind of consumer
good There are no luxury brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no commercial brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no bargain bank brand There's no
brand so people looking at weed Mike Tyson
[SPEAKER_00]: or or you know Wiz Khalifa or You know
Belushi or you know all these people why
[SPEAKER_00]: not me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't I have a brand and everybody
feels like they can get in on the ground
[SPEAKER_00]: floor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because who's their competition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right like and it's gonna take a long
while for brands to establish itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean like in the south Coca-Cola is so
dominant in some spots people to when they
[SPEAKER_00]: order a soda.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just say I want a coke Right like
like coca-cola became dominant enough they
[SPEAKER_00]: became the word for soda In certain parts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like in the midwest where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pop, you know, I'm like Pop could be
different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like you're saying yeah one thing
becomes so dominant, you know dominant and
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're gonna like California became
legal in what?
[SPEAKER_00]: 2018 or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really the first half a decade in
and so What marketing is gonna work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody has any idea but there's obviously
a lot of rich people that want to throw
[SPEAKER_03]: their hat in the ring and see if it works
out Yeah, and I mean like, you know Like
[SPEAKER_03]: George Foreman was a huge star for a long
time and he had been around for a long
[SPEAKER_03]: time and he was well respected by most
people and everyone knew the name and he
[SPEAKER_03]: was a heavy-duty fighter and he was well
known and you know, like I don't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: like I don't want to like Tell people
there's no Santa Claus or nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like George Foreman doesn't make
grills
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I really need I need an
electric grill in my kitchen where I can
[SPEAKER_03]: collect the grease and lose a couple
pounds Here's a good point, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've spent a bunch of your podcast
career interviewing individual people that
[SPEAKER_00]: pour their heart and soul into weed
various things A lot heavy focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding obviously but other things too,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When modern marketing comes in most of the
time modern marketing you're dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: people that have nothing to do but the
marketing So that's a huge seismic shift
[SPEAKER_00]: of like you talking directly to mean gene
about his past in Mendo or breeding or
[SPEAKER_00]: what his vibe is Right, like there's
companies that are like I'm just gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: hire this person I'm gonna have a
marketing campaign I'm gonna hire actors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna hire, you know sports figures
I'm gonna hire celebrities or musicians
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're gonna promote my brand because
most things aren't promoted by the people
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that make them when you seek when
you see car advertisements It's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: engineers at the Ford plant in you know in
Michigan or or Georgia It's like Jimi
[SPEAKER_00]: Hendrix and like a car racing across the
Rio Grande You know like marketing is way
[SPEAKER_00]: different and so we have To get used to
the idea that there's gonna be this weird
[SPEAKER_00]: new disconnect of marketers that the only
thing they're doing in weed is marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right so he's saying that
like he he's down with Mike Tyson because
[SPEAKER_00]: at least Mike Tyson has been a Obvious
heavy toker his whole life and has been
[SPEAKER_00]: down for the cause but most people
marketing it They're just gonna market it
[SPEAKER_00]: because they think they're a marketable
person that's gonna make money off the
[SPEAKER_00]: campaign and it's gonna reflect well on
your brand And that was only my take on it
[SPEAKER_03]: of like whether or not like on my personal
opinion Like what do you think about them
[SPEAKER_03]: using his name for seeds and stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like well at least he's a pothead,
you know But like that might have had not
[SPEAKER_03]: very much to do with why they actually
picked him They might have realized like
[SPEAKER_03]: huh.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a huge name and He's not anti weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's pro weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I bet he'd be available as a name They
might have thought like damn it would be
[SPEAKER_03]: cool if we could get like If we could get
like Floyd Mayweather like that would be
[SPEAKER_03]: cool and then they're like, oh,
you know, he don't smoke He's not gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: want to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're not gonna be able to get him.
[SPEAKER_03]: But guess what Tyson already sells meat So
he's on this list of people who we could
[SPEAKER_03]: get and when we look through the list we
go, huh I'll bet our money we'd get the
[SPEAKER_03]: most bang for our buck from advertising
through there so like you said like a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: what I notice on you know, I addressed it
more from the perspective of what I
[SPEAKER_03]: noticed online, which is where people go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh now Jay-z's getting into weed now
so-and-so's getting into weed They're
[SPEAKER_03]: like, what does this guy even know about
weed and I'm like, guess what guys Jay-z's
[SPEAKER_03]: not rolling the joints He's not putting
the we're not shaking the weed in the pre
[SPEAKER_03]: rolls and picking out the smells and shit
They already have a whole weed company and
[SPEAKER_03]: they go to Jay-z and they go dude,
let's partner and here's the deal we do
[SPEAKER_03]: everything we just need your name and
we're gonna call this shit Jay-z weed and
[SPEAKER_03]: they know that because he already has 1.5
billion fans around the globe that all
[SPEAKER_03]: they need to do is tap into this little
percentage of it and they're gonna be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to sell instantly all this Jay-z weed and
when you look online Yeah, and all the
[SPEAKER_03]: real weed heads are like, what does he
have to do with weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: He never made no he's never taken clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's never done nothing and I'm like,
yeah, but like you said With the cars,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, guess what like Matthew
McConaughey.
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't work at the Lincoln factory.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not how He doesn't shit my hats or
leather gloves People are in such a bubble
[SPEAKER_03]: so weed people look at it and they go Oh,
you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't do this and it's funny because
like even me I'm in such a little weed
[SPEAKER_03]: bubble that when there's things done by
seed companies like that where it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit dubious and whatever way even a
lot of people who I know who grow weed who
[SPEAKER_03]: have grown weed longer than me and I'm
having a conversation they're kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at me like well What is like is
this stuff that you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it unethical or is it like what like?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you just like slap names long shit?
[SPEAKER_03]: And is it does any of the shit matter?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what are you even talking about
because they're not inside this little
[SPEAKER_03]: intellectualized academic bubble of like
this is what real weed stuff is and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: so hard for people And even like my myself
included with the knee-jerk reaction is to
[SPEAKER_03]: just go this is all bullshit But then if
you compare it to how everything really
[SPEAKER_03]: works, you go, yeah, it is bullshit But
guess what like that's how everything
[SPEAKER_03]: functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just because we're the brands they
hire big advertising companies to pitch
[SPEAKER_00]: them ideas for themes and Stuff they want
their brand to be associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing campaigns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, and so what's gonna happen
with weed eventually?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the beginning of it is like
you're gonna have some guys in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: spitballing marketing ideas based on what
demographic they're trying to go after
[SPEAKER_00]: with weed and Then they're gonna pitch
that to the weed company and the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: company is gonna pitch the pick the one
they want You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's how selling cars or guitars or
clothes or music or whatever works Weed
[SPEAKER_00]: was just wasn't just ready to like be
dumped into actual Capitalism we were our
[SPEAKER_00]: own weird little autistic corner Of the
world and now we're like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we got tossed in and so yeah, you get
Martha Stewart Jim Belushi Mike Tyson You
[SPEAKER_01]: know whoever Yeah Totally and I think if
nothing else at the very core of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an indicator of the degree of
Normalization that is occurring because as
[SPEAKER_01]: you're saying we're starting now to see it
just being branded and marketed in the way
[SPEAKER_01]: we see Every day brand, you know the
Lincoln brand marketed so, you know in
[SPEAKER_01]: evolving space We'll we'll have to wait to
see if we get the Oprah OG on to our next
[SPEAKER_01]: story I wanted to chat about the winner of
the ego clash 2023 of the ice water hash
[SPEAKER_01]: section So the 2023 ego clash has come and
gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just quickly flick our screen over
and the winner for the ice hash category
[SPEAKER_01]: for 2023 was none other than trichome
tortoise who took out first place with his
[SPEAKER_01]: cut of blockberry much pull a photo up of
it Interestingly this cut of blockberry is
[SPEAKER_01]: not the super booth cut nor the breeder
cut both of which equally have won a
[SPEAKER_01]: number of cups and Quite well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a different cutting that trichome
tortoise found in a packet of the f1 beans
[SPEAKER_01]: himself Now I think the thing that jumps
out to me the most about this Win is that
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of flies in the face of some of
the common sentiment you hear about people
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling the current genetic pool
Especially the hype strains are rather
[SPEAKER_01]: stagnant and boring given the ego clash is
a blind judge contest Judged largely by
[SPEAKER_01]: people who would be considered industry
leaders and thought leaders And top
[SPEAKER_01]: contributors they all agreed that the
blockberry was the most impressive sample
[SPEAKER_01]: out edging many other well-known
competitors So for me this causes The
[SPEAKER_01]: question to be asked does this fly in the
face of people criticizing the current
[SPEAKER_01]: hype strains saying they're boring And
what does this mean given that it was able
[SPEAKER_01]: to out edge several other entries?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was down there um, and I didn't
get to see all the different stuff I just
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of was hanging out, you know like a
casual The cool thing about that contest
[SPEAKER_03]: is that if you enter then you're a judge
and if you're a judge you can have like a
[SPEAKER_03]: buddy to help you judge because it's
overwhelming because they have 42 hash
[SPEAKER_03]: entries and You basically have to try them
all if you want to judge them and so you
[SPEAKER_03]: only I think the whole thing starts the
judging starts in the morning at 11 or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever and you have until 5 or whatever
in the afternoon you have to sit there and
[SPEAKER_03]: just try them all smoke them all You know
I've peeked in and kind of seen what was
[SPEAKER_03]: going on and everybody's really trying
their best taking notes doing all the
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff But it is cool because it's being
judged by the people who enter their own
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff It's not being judged by people who
don't have any skin in it, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: so people are are trying to judge what is
is their thing and you know, uh like
[SPEAKER_03]: really going with what is you know,
their taste and and So it's not Basically,
[SPEAKER_03]: it should be about as transparent as you
can get That said like it's an interesting
[SPEAKER_03]: thing because When you're to judge what's
like It's got it's got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of got to judge it like
Objectively, so you're gonna look at it
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're gonna go.
[SPEAKER_03]: How is it presented?
[SPEAKER_03]: How well did they process it dry it?
[SPEAKER_03]: How clean is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: How pure is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: How much flavor does it have What you
know, so my point being that in any
[SPEAKER_03]: competition regardless of how you try to
design it You're naturally gonna be
[SPEAKER_03]: picking What is the best and you might not
actually be picking?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is your favorite and that's just the
nature of competitions where you're trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to be objective So there might be
something that somebody likes better
[SPEAKER_03]: that's really odd but that they look at it
And they go like me like my taste in music
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody might go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what's your favorite meat?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, I don't even really want to
tell you because I already know it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: that good or What's your favorite way to
make a burger?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know that there's better cheeses,
but sorry, but I like American cheese on
[SPEAKER_03]: my burger I know it's this weird shit and
it's basically total garbage processed
[SPEAKER_03]: food But it tastes fucking amazing on a
cheeseburger, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wouldn't like go necessarily Judge
the burger competition and be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, yeah this stupid little burger over
here This is the best one, even though
[SPEAKER_03]: that one might be my favorite so it's
always hard to really know what that stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: is like the the flour was like I can't
remember but I think it was like lemon
[SPEAKER_03]: cherry gelato one and I'm like well as
everybody who has a lot of different kinds
[SPEAKER_03]: of weed I Don't have a lot of buddies who
when I talk to them They're like dude all
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been smoking is this lemon cherry
gelato, but when you look and you go,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay What was harvested perfectly grown
perfectly?
[SPEAKER_03]: Presented in the jar trimmed the best
cured really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It burned really good It had the most
flavor out of all these samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had the most smell It was the most
clear it smelled like it was preserved the
[SPEAKER_03]: best you're gonna go This is the best
sample of weed meaning that like this
[SPEAKER_03]: grower and this guy how he handled the
weed he did that The best work and it
[SPEAKER_03]: deserves to win because we're judging it
this many points for this this many points
[SPEAKER_03]: for this and this many points for this and
Then there might be one thing that's odd
[SPEAKER_03]: there that someone's like this is my
favorite but the dude probably should have
[SPEAKER_03]: jarred it a day later and he could have
trimmed it a little bit better and it
[SPEAKER_03]: burnt a little rough because of what it is
and It's not gonna win a cup, but it might
[SPEAKER_03]: be the thing that you look at and go This
is the very best so my take on the way
[SPEAKER_03]: that all these things work is that
Contests have those like inherent Built-in
[SPEAKER_03]: flaws and they're not they're like not,
you know, they're the feature They're not
[SPEAKER_03]: the bug contest just by nature are kind of
weird because you you know like in the old
[SPEAKER_03]: days if you were to have that kind of a
contest like an old harvest thing people
[SPEAKER_03]: would have been you would have had a bunch
of a bunch of dudes who were hippies and
[SPEAKER_03]: bikers and dope dealers and whatever and
they'd be Smoking and they'd go that
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking bag right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best shit here but now you have
a bunch of people who are essentially
[SPEAKER_03]: scientists and they're analyzing the
samples for all the points to see what is
[SPEAKER_03]: the thing that is the very best and out of
that I am fully in I'm in full belief that
[SPEAKER_03]: that sample of hash was probably the
best-made hash That was in the contest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there was a few judges who
probably had another one is number one
[SPEAKER_03]: Other but as it all levels out and you see
the most judges have it as number one It
[SPEAKER_03]: winds up being the winner.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that doesn't say too much about your
question But that's just so that people
[SPEAKER_03]: understand how these contests work that
they're not like Necessarily gonna be the
[SPEAKER_03]: thing that you would show up and say it's
the very best one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my favorite But it's the one that the
most people will look at and go this dude
[SPEAKER_03]: really nailed it like I guarantee the dude
you're not gonna win that contest and not
[SPEAKER_03]: be an excellent hash maker and it had to
be excellent starting material it had to
[SPEAKER_03]: be excellent from the Genetics that
started with the way it was grown the way
[SPEAKER_03]: it was washed the way it was dried The way
it was presented and packaged like because
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen Brandon who runs the thing I've
seen people show up and have like sloppy
[SPEAKER_03]: jars and he's like dude, he's like if you
Packaged it sloppy I don't even I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: even have to question the way that you
washed it I already know you didn't do you
[SPEAKER_03]: already are not operating at the level
that these other guys are you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing your a game and he'll just
Disqualify three or four entries at the
[SPEAKER_03]: beginning at every one of the ego clash
because he's like dude It's all smashed on
[SPEAKER_03]: the sides and it looks all fucked up those
ones You might smoke them and be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh those are my favorite, but it's a
competition and it has to be presented,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like at a dog show You might have the
dog and you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this dog is amazing, but you're like,
yeah, but you guys didn't even like the
[SPEAKER_03]: dog You forgot to brush the butt or
something and the hairs fucked up like you
[SPEAKER_03]: can't do that That's not how you compete
when you come to a competition You have to
[SPEAKER_03]: make sure that everything is all perfect
and then from there starts the judging of
[SPEAKER_03]: what You know the flavor the genetics the
way it actually the way what it does on
[SPEAKER_03]: the nail how it actually goes up how makes
you feel what it's like when you Exhale it
[SPEAKER_03]: how it leaves your mouth feeling and after
all that that was the one that every Buddy
[SPEAKER_03]: liked and if you look at the genetics,
those aren't lightweight Things those
[SPEAKER_03]: things are packing a lot of flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the combination you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I could See how the things in this
could lend themselves to some real heavy
[SPEAKER_03]: flavors and all that and and the last
thing to say about that as far as the more
[SPEAKER_03]: to answer the question of the of the
Modern hype genetics is like you said,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a different cut than the ones that
people already knew But the reality is
[SPEAKER_03]: when you take these things and you mash
them up and you make something new I've
[SPEAKER_03]: seen like I've made like a cookie cross
and Toss hit it with my mail and grown it
[SPEAKER_03]: and had a lot of them be like,
yeah, you know whatever and then had one
[SPEAKER_03]: plant that I was like I don't care what
the genetics are you can tell me that it
[SPEAKER_03]: was runs crossed with og crossed with
Gelato, but if it grew this plant nobody's
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna care We're all gonna agree that this
one was really really good So,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know in my opinion as far as like hype
versus old-school versus whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um it really comes down to like which
plant you pick and then You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure before they ever Got to the point
where they got that to the ego clash a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of people had already rooted through their
bags and they're hashing a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: were raised their eyebrows and went wow
you Got something special here,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, so that's like my take on the on
that kind of stuff is it's like yeah You
[SPEAKER_03]: might have a lot of so-so stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you select the right plant you
might find that plant out of Anywhere it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like it's genetic so you could relate it
to like having Like a super athlete like
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, you're gonna get more super athlete
You're gonna get more people running fast
[SPEAKER_03]: and winning in Kenya But that doesn't mean
that you're not gonna get somebody you're
[SPEAKER_03]: not gonna get a crazy runner from Scotland
It's just gonna be harder to find the guy
[SPEAKER_03]: from Scotland that can outrun the Kenyans
but the fastest guy in the world might be
[SPEAKER_03]: Scottish she might be Dutch or it could be
whatever but if you are gonna put together
[SPEAKER_03]: an Olympic team to work to run long
distance you're gonna Be like wow,
[SPEAKER_03]: these Kenyans are whooping your ass and
that's how these genetics is genetics So
[SPEAKER_03]: like you're gonna have you know,
like pit bulls are gonna fight really
[SPEAKER_03]: great, but it might turn out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's crazy We got an Akita that just
kicked some pit bulls asses and it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: crazy and that's the same deal with those
kind of plants so, you know, that's my
[SPEAKER_03]: take on like the modern height is like You
go through enough plants find the special
[SPEAKER_03]: one and you might have that crazy thing
and that you know It's a mix of those
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the I I have a couple riffs on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I mean for one You know,
he talked about it in the very beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: of what he was chatting about But I almost
think ego clash is more like endurance
[SPEAKER_00]: clash Okay, because if you're gonna smoke
I you know Him and I are both mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: flower people too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be really hard for us but if
you're gonna go there and you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke 42 Kinds of what people think of as
their best hash their best foot forward
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're hoping could win and you're
gonna smoke 42 kinds of hash in five hours
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not really going to be able to
discern much with effect Because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just stacking thing on top of thing on top
of thing on top of thing over and over
[SPEAKER_00]: again So really in a way it's it's like he
said it's about presentation these guys
[SPEAKER_00]: are Hash makers they know when something
Looks right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know when someone hit hit it really
perfect, you know I think a lot of times
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor is a lot more important in these
competitions than effect because you can
[SPEAKER_00]: judge flavor straight but a hat,
you know hash by hash where because effect
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds it's like if I'm smoking my 15th
dab and And each dab before that was 14
[SPEAKER_00]: different things and then I'm taking my
16th dab six minutes later Me judging
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's a creeper whether it hits me
fast or slow or that you're not it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: just blending in at some point I mean,
I don't tell you is when you're doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: fino hunt or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only smell so much weed Before
like your nose is just like you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: take a break for a while You know or smell
some coffee or something really strong to
[SPEAKER_00]: get your palate back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as ego clash goes, I think it's
become like it's the coolest like Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: California competition That's currently
existing since Emerald Cup is shifted to a
[SPEAKER_00]: more corporate thing and more south and
this and that Like what Brandon does is
[SPEAKER_00]: real and he invites a bunch of real hash
smokers I think it's more of a flavor and
[SPEAKER_00]: a presentation competition Than it is like
what's the best hash because no one would
[SPEAKER_00]: say well, I'm gonna judge the best hash by
smoking You know eight different kinds an
[SPEAKER_00]: hour for five hours in a row like what if
the best hash is the Is was the first but
[SPEAKER_00]: you're on 38 You know like in all those
effects compound and the other thing I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: say Good just getting back to the genetics
portion is I don't I think everything
[SPEAKER_00]: you're saying about like a lot of genetics
being muddled Recently is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and I do think that the classics are
in general a lot quite a bit better but
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to hash Over the last ten
years is really the first ten years that
[SPEAKER_00]: people Have been breeding for this type of
extract So as time goes on people are
[SPEAKER_00]: washing stuff you can I've seen stuff
that's amazing flower But it tastes like a
[SPEAKER_00]: tire Well, you know like when you make it
into rosin and it might make your brow
[SPEAKER_00]: sweat But it doesn't translate and so what
people are doing now is they're breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: for the medium of extraction Right for
water hash for freeze-drying for treating
[SPEAKER_00]: it in different ways and It's not so much
about how quality the flower is it's
[SPEAKER_00]: because you might have some amazing flower
But like does it wash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what does it look like when it's
washed how when I put it through these
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the end product look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right like I'll tell you that now a lot of
times two terms you hear in hash all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time is the things a washer or it's a
dumper Right ten years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: These terms did not exist Did you ever
hear all that things a washer dude No,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean back in the day you washed your
trim, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, so it was all dry So most stuff washed
because once you let the resin firm up a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of things that when they're still
green they'll melt in the water they would
[SPEAKER_03]: actually Do really you could actually make
stuff like I have things that you can't
[SPEAKER_03]: wash fresh But if you wash them once
they're already dry and that's what
[SPEAKER_03]: Brandon told me To he goes, you know some
of these things that you can't wash fresh
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes the reason why they you can't wash
them fresh is because the resin is so good
[SPEAKER_03]: That it'll actually withstand drying and
if you wash it when it's dry instead
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll get hash that's so good that it
didn't really need to be washed when it
[SPEAKER_03]: was wet But you can have you know,
you can have almost a comparable product
[SPEAKER_03]: off of your dry weed So you just wash it
dry if you really want to get some And I
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't expect him to say that because I
know everything's how it's done It's very
[SPEAKER_03]: standard, but he was like no, he's like
some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's worth washing dry That's the only way
you're gonna get it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so really for the last five or ten years
is the first Era where cannabis has been
[SPEAKER_00]: bred or been being bred specifically for
how it comes out in the way people are
[SPEAKER_00]: making hash today and So you should see
strains that might not be Like I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: skittles is a premium example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, like skittles is not attractive
flower Like you would never like in 2006
[SPEAKER_00]: if you had skittles, you know,
like before the hash revolution Like
[SPEAKER_00]: people would just look at it and they
would think it was like B or C grade weed
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah But it turns out that like when you
put it through the processes that we used
[SPEAKER_00]: to make rosin or like really high-grade
ice water these days It shines and its
[SPEAKER_00]: turf profile gets concentrated and it's
amazing and it's its effect is heightened
[SPEAKER_00]: and so like I don't think it's fair to
compare strains of old to strains of now
[SPEAKER_00]: because now They're breeding things that
might suck, but they're an amazing washer
[SPEAKER_00]: You see what I'm saying where before we
were breeding for like mold resistance or
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain size or when it was gonna finish
You're putting different filters on what
[SPEAKER_00]: you want the product to be and now for the
first time ever we're like what strain
[SPEAKER_03]: makes the most fire water hash Yeah,
and it's a big I was just gonna say it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: big thing of breeding is actually like
what's your goal?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which traits are valuable to you?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like it's not one size fits all it was
like when tangy was big Like you couldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: like wash tangy, but if you made bho of it
It was amazing and the flower wasn't very
[SPEAKER_03]: good But I would smell somebody dabbing it
and I would go What are you guys dabbing
[SPEAKER_03]: and they'd be like, oh, it's tangy bho And
I'd be like, oh, it smells so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells like you're like Vaporizing
grapefruit peels over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they even advertise like oh,
this is a 6% washer Because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding things that like hey if you
extract it in this form This stuff not
[SPEAKER_00]: only yields well, but comes out fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right and so in a way You're taking
people that like me or or mean gene that
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly bred flower Okay for flower and now
you're getting a class of breeders that
[SPEAKER_00]: are essentially resin farmers Right,
they're farming resin and and not just
[SPEAKER_00]: farming resin Like he said like tangy not
just farming resin like but farming resin
[SPEAKER_00]: that works with a specific extraction
method Because I'll tell you all those
[SPEAKER_00]: things That got entered into ego clash the
people that made them the hash makers that
[SPEAKER_00]: made them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, oh man that came out
exceptional That washed and dried look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the way it looked look at the way it came
out look at the way it You know what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like they're specific cultivars that
all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, whoa Yeah, and it might have
excelled just in that realm, but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: great for that type of competition For
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean they're breeding better
weed It just means they're putting
[SPEAKER_00]: different selection pressure on the weed
they're breeding and asking it to do
[SPEAKER_00]: different things and It might produce
better than some weeds From a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: ago that never had those selection
pressures put on itself Do you see what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and some of the old things too that
people have that are like real standard
[SPEAKER_03]: old flower staples that people like to
smoke like you might discover like oh
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you only need to grow like with with
some of the stuff that I have,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know People will be like, oh I've got
I'm gonna do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna cross it with this I'm gonna
make it wash and I'm like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean that that'll definitely Work and I
do the same thing where I'm like,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay I'm gonna cross this with that like
with cherry limeade I did it I crossed
[SPEAKER_03]: with a bunch of stuff to try to figure out
one that would get the flavor and would
[SPEAKER_03]: still wash and The reality is though like
if you also Just go through if you just
[SPEAKER_03]: instead of our keep keep looking through a
dozen plants If you go ahead and look
[SPEAKER_03]: through two or three hundred females of
some of these things like lime You'll go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is actually a crazy washer but
because you have never pushed it in that
[SPEAKER_03]: direction that never became the
predominant thing that pops out of a
[SPEAKER_03]: population because Who would have thought
you were gonna take all your in the 90s
[SPEAKER_03]: and throw it in while it's still wet and
Smash it up and make hash out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the weirdest idea, but then
people did it It was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so yeah, you don't know those things
till you try them And so you can still
[SPEAKER_03]: look through the old things and go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Because that's the thing that you I try
to tell people there isn't new weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have it There's no new weed that
trait of having resin that wants to break
[SPEAKER_03]: off You have to get it from somewhere and
it's been here for thousands of years It's
[SPEAKER_03]: just a matter or incorporating certain
traits into your lines Look at it like
[SPEAKER_00]: this before scientific testing like you
were just talking about the 90s or back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the day How many different things didn't
make the cut because we're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, that's not the good one But it had
like CBG or CBG Or high levels and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: just like all smoking it in joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, this is definitely not the
selection So until you had testing you
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't select for CBG or CBD It was it
would like if you were doing a smoke test
[SPEAKER_00]: you were like that one didn't hit me the
right way And so it could be within that
[SPEAKER_00]: population But until you start selecting
for those traits and trying to maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: them and that's what I think is happening
with hash Now as people are breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically for hash when hash used to be
Like a side product to the flower and and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're now seeing so we should be seeing
people Coming up with really good hashers
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will Because they've been working
on breeding things for that one trait To
[SPEAKER_03]: make really exceptional looking hash Yeah,
and it sounds funny to people now but back
[SPEAKER_03]: in the day hash that was really really
high quality Nobody knew how to smoke it
[SPEAKER_03]: if you Had really really good hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's a funny thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I I'm my friend Felix his his father was
Reinhard delp and he was the guy who
[SPEAKER_03]: patented ice water hash Extracting in the
90s and as far back as 94 95 I was riding
[SPEAKER_03]: in the car in high school at lunch with
Felix and Felix is like hey I got some
[SPEAKER_03]: hash and Felix pulls out his hash and you
hold his hash up and you can look through
[SPEAKER_03]: it like a Piece of glass and I go this is
hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: How would you make hash like this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because my dad he extracts it he uses cold
water He uses ice and water to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: make this and I was like, wow,
okay It's crazy and I didn't realize but
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, he was he was he was using fresh
wheat So there's no doubt that hash didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: explode until all I was calling the
accoutrements all the various All the
[SPEAKER_00]: bangers all the various scrapers all the
ways to heat it learning What temps to do
[SPEAKER_00]: like we were talking about cherry red
bangers when they first started and
[SPEAKER_00]: arsenic and cyanide Learning what temps
they needed to safely be at learning how
[SPEAKER_00]: to heat the banger not Chasing the banger
it had to go through Like he was saying we
[SPEAKER_00]: when we first smoked bh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we lit like these charcoals You know
like you didn't really or you smeared it
[SPEAKER_00]: on top of weed You didn't have any of the
gear that people consider essential today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no Turp slurpers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no like hash pearls.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no glop mops to cleat like there
was none of any of that that all had to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop Once like the little industry sort
of happened just to kitchen knives Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: hot knives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah hot knives, you know, yeah I had a
buddy who used to make a lot of oil and he
[SPEAKER_03]: was the one who showed me how to make bh
Oh back around 2000 and he was the fried
[SPEAKER_03]: never heard of it I didn't know anything
about it and he was like this is what This
[SPEAKER_03]: is a technique that people use they use
liquid gases to extract things from plants
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something that they do and it
can be used for weed and I was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: wow, that's crazy, dude And so he like
showed me yeah, this is what you do and
[SPEAKER_03]: use the butane and all that and so Back
then there was no way to smoke it So what
[SPEAKER_03]: we used to do is take a bong with a pretty
good-sized bowl and we would pack it full
[SPEAKER_03]: of weed and we would sit there and we
would smoke the weed gently so It wouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: snap until all there was was ash until no
matter what you did.
[SPEAKER_03]: You couldn't get any smoke to come off the
ash or the bowl and that ash would
[SPEAKER_03]: basically just be a scaffolding that would
be left just straight nothing but carbon
[SPEAKER_03]: that could not burn because it had already
lost all the carbohydrates and everything
[SPEAKER_03]: out of it and then we would drip using a
using a safety pin Unfolded we would we
[SPEAKER_03]: would heat with the torch drip it until
you would reconstituted the ash and and
[SPEAKER_03]: made it be made it have oil in it Then you
would use the torch to heat the ash,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was completely neutral It couldn't
burn because you'd already taken
[SPEAKER_03]: everything out of it And then you would be
able to just vaporize the hash oil back
[SPEAKER_03]: out of the ash and you would get clean
Hash oil burning that way by holding the
[SPEAKER_03]: torch really far away from it a torch
lighter, but then what he Figured out
[SPEAKER_03]: which people have started to do more only
over the last couple years was the cold
[SPEAKER_03]: start Which was not what we called it So
what he would do was he would take like
[SPEAKER_03]: the meth pipes that had the bubble on the
end That are a big bubble of glass with a
[SPEAKER_03]: little hole on the top and we would heat
them with the torch until you could bend
[SPEAKER_03]: it so that it could sit in the bong as a
downstead down tube and then the bubble
[SPEAKER_03]: would go out straight from the bong and
then we would put the oil in that and then
[SPEAKER_03]: through the hole on the top and then we
would use the torch on the bottom to heat
[SPEAKER_03]: it until you see the vapor come off of it
and you would only have to have about this
[SPEAKER_03]: much vapor in the bong and You would hit
it and it would be the biggest bong hit
[SPEAKER_03]: you ever had from the tiniest little
amount But it was cold start cold start
[SPEAKER_03]: honey oil bong hits and it was the most
crazy potent after you smoke that for a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit You don't get high off of
anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all you can really do is really
smoke and that was like the coolest thing
[SPEAKER_03]: to us because we were like dude you could
make it off of weed that was just Like he
[SPEAKER_03]: told me he's like, you know when you're
smoking and you pull off the little leaves
[SPEAKER_03]: and you have all the little stems and all
that He's all don't throw all that on the
[SPEAKER_03]: tray He's all set up a little jar and as
you're going through fill up that jar and
[SPEAKER_03]: when you get done You'll have a whole
bunch of it and you can blast it and
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll have the same quality of this honey
oil that we're smoking And I was like what
[SPEAKER_03]: a trip and so we used to just sit there
and smoke That and what would happen was
[SPEAKER_03]: because of cold starting it in there It
would also be an interesting distillation
[SPEAKER_03]: process to where when you would get to the
end of it You would notice that you might
[SPEAKER_03]: get it might be like a little bit left
That was a little extra runny and like
[SPEAKER_03]: green especially because he would make
hunt He would make hash oil the old-school
[SPEAKER_03]: way using like alcohol and purifying it
through charcoal filters and doing all
[SPEAKER_03]: this filtration process and then you know
So not with butane regular traditional
[SPEAKER_03]: hash oil and when you would get to the end
of that There would be this little
[SPEAKER_03]: fraction there that would be like you
could tell it wasn't as good as the rest
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you smoked it, it would be a little
more harsh so when you got to the certain
[SPEAKER_03]: point you'd notice it get a little bit
extra runny and have a little bit of an
[SPEAKER_03]: off color and we would tip it over and
heat it out until it all dripped out and
[SPEAKER_03]: get it clean and then we would put the
fresh stuff in and It was the biggest pain
[SPEAKER_03]: in the ass and you couldn't sell the shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody wanted it You tried to figure out
like guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the most you've never been this
blasted But you couldn't do anything with
[SPEAKER_03]: it and that I think was why people at a
certain point started making fucking moon
[SPEAKER_03]: rocks Because you're like you've got to
put it on something right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's got to be a way to smoke this
shit so we would like drip it on joints
[SPEAKER_03]: and now people make like um make like a
Why is my my my mind slipping right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the oh the hash whole joints,
you know or Stuff like that when it's too
[SPEAKER_03]: melty.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to put it in somewhere where it
can soak into something but back then
[SPEAKER_03]: people just really didn't know how to do
it so breeding for it would have been like
[SPEAKER_03]: the goofiest shit you could ever do
because You're not gonna be able to sell
[SPEAKER_03]: it and tell everybody bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just bend a meth pipe They're gonna be
like what the fuck are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean Weed but now that's the standard
like people looking crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I guess you could say in closing
that weed breeding for hash making is
[SPEAKER_00]: advancing the gear and the accoutrements
and the stuff that they use and the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that we consume hash also seems to change
now every two or three years and the cool
[SPEAKER_00]: thing about ego clash and the way The
reason why I like the name is because it
[SPEAKER_00]: is a bunch of hash making perfectionist
judges who are all judging each other and
[SPEAKER_00]: even though the tech and the breeding
changes every few years because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: young enough industry that as people find
out new better ways of doing things it
[SPEAKER_00]: spreads wildly it's pretty cool in that
sense because they are pushing it forward
[SPEAKER_00]: and It's not a mature industry yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's lots of change Every few years
there's new pieces of gear people weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: using there's different ways like he was
saying cold starts We've gone from 900
[SPEAKER_00]: degree cherry glowing bangers to cold
starts to different tech to how you heat
[SPEAKER_00]: it up to how you this like and that's
probably going to keep happening for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while until the arc of improvement slows
and then like the generally accepted
[SPEAKER_00]: practices because that arc has slowed just
spread and nobody's Able to make leaps and
[SPEAKER_00]: bounds advancements big right now It's
young enough that leaps and bounds happen
[SPEAKER_00]: every couple years and I would expect for
breeding that hash Would probably like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's still leaps and bounds in hash
breeding Just like he was saying Brandon
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out that like some things wash
better dry some things wash better fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of Tech and information
they're gonna get about how to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: certain strains of weed To maximize what
they can do for you in the little jar For
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's so there's a lot of change and
there's a lot of advancement and it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: happening pretty quick and the ego clash I
think is a really good venue for people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are really knowledgeable to get
together and shoot the shit and See what
[SPEAKER_03]: they think is their top And somewhere
right now somebody's sitting on the
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics that are the very best new hash
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the crazy stuff You know,
and if it wins a couple things then it'll
[SPEAKER_03]: be maybe the new hype genetics and we'll
be like well What are so what is the stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's like it has the merit and so it's
what you want for these traits and
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody's sitting on it right now and has
had them forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like I'm like, well you guys just
figured out Cold start like that 25 years
[SPEAKER_03]: fellas, you know Like we were doing this
so long ago that I didn't even think to
[SPEAKER_03]: like I was like, oh this must this is how
people do it Now I don't I never
[SPEAKER_03]: understood why people didn't just put the
hash in there first and then heat it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like Think of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It works really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were doing it a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great You know you get it's just
like when you barely torch a long hit you
[SPEAKER_03]: just barely heat it up and you just get
some and then when I saw people do it I
[SPEAKER_03]: was like All right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a trippy thing and the same
with Same with the genetics like people
[SPEAKER_03]: realize like oh shit, you can wash our
diesel like yeah, we can and so if you mix
[SPEAKER_03]: that with You know runs and then you have
some sour runs and you grow 200 of them
[SPEAKER_03]: then all of a sudden you have something
you're like It's it's it's just these two
[SPEAKER_03]: dumb things and you're like, yeah,
but wait till you see this plan,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know That's what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome That's it love it so many so
many fantastic points there and I like the
[SPEAKER_01]: The moniker the endurance clash that it
certainly makes sense why the turbines
[SPEAKER_00]: would help you to shine through but I
Could not smoke 42 kinds of hash that
[SPEAKER_00]: quality in five hours and not probably
feel like I was floating In order to judge
[SPEAKER_00]: it you have to smoke hash as your date.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably don't smoke flour very much
You're probably smoking hash all day long
[SPEAKER_00]: to train to be able to smoke 42 kinds of
extremely high grade hash in a very short
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time Even with a homie with you
to like help you breathe and take some
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen Every now and again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's just got like the face mask.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the math You got to take a dab every
seven and a half minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm saying Yeah,
and all of them are some of the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: grade hash in, California You're probably
like as high as you're gonna get by like
[SPEAKER_00]: high like hit six or seven and you've got
35 to go Well, look one last point of view
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to Take a look at before we move on
from the block barriers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to put it out there that At this
point, I think blockberry should be
[SPEAKER_01]: considered elite genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: My reason for that is that There are at
least three different cuttings that have
[SPEAKER_01]: emerged from a relatively small f1 pool of
seeds each one of these cups has one each
[SPEAKER_01]: one of these cuttings has one multiple
cups and The extra thing I'll add because
[SPEAKER_01]: I would agree with what you said not to
dog about the hash being bred for that
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually one cups in the flour
category.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually one more cups in the flour
Category than the hash category.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's done both So I'm not aware of any
strain that has produced as many cuttings
[SPEAKER_01]: that have all Three three cuts each of
them one multiple cuts cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: God.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a tongue twister And so yeah,
I'm interested to hear any thoughts
[SPEAKER_00]: disagree agree My definition of elites is
just basically it doesn't have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone because it's almost never
everyone but a decent percentage of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledgeable smokers all across the world
agree that this is fire Like that to me is
[SPEAKER_00]: an elite like you can have elites that
aren't your preference But you still agree
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're really high quality Maybe you
don't like the flavor or the high but like
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of your friends love it and you
trust what they you know, so I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, like if once you've started winning
multiple awards with flower and hash and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got multiple phenos coming out of
the same line Obviously that line can
[SPEAKER_00]: throw out some fire You know For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm always I'm always impressed
honestly when there's any seed line that
[SPEAKER_03]: has more than one plant that you even hear
about because For the most part things
[SPEAKER_03]: that people put out they can even be
quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've made a lot of crosses and a lot of
them, you know, like basically everything
[SPEAKER_03]: That I put out someone will hit me up and
they'll say that it's their favorite But
[SPEAKER_03]: just because that's the case doesn't mean
that I'm ever gonna hear about it anywhere
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard about it because I made it
somebody contacted me about it directly
[SPEAKER_03]: Other people didn't hear shit about that
plant like maybe if they're friends with
[SPEAKER_03]: that person but for something that really
rings bells and there's more than one that
[SPEAKER_03]: came out of a line and like like Nazis
talked about this before there's like NL
[SPEAKER_03]: Five Hayes there's multiple cuts that are
like famous cuts where you're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's that electric Google is these pips
these different things you're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay so that thing is a crazy like a true
real elite like I Did a cross that I did
[SPEAKER_03]: like I put out pie scream and there's one
cut that skunk text circulated and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: really great and then these people hit me
up from England and they're like This
[SPEAKER_03]: thing's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this other guy hit me up from
England and he's like this is the craziest
[SPEAKER_03]: Cut and I'm like, where'd you get it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it theirs?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's all no it came from my buddy He
popped it and I was like, okay And then
[SPEAKER_03]: another guy I'm like this is this the one
that you got for that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get it from skunk tech?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like no my buddy popped it from
seed and I'm like, okay So this is a
[SPEAKER_03]: really really good seed line.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has more than one plant Yeah where
while I'm looking around people are
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about it And so you can tell like
there's good stuff that went into that and
[SPEAKER_03]: in that particular case I made tons of
crosses with that man And a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: crosses there's a couple people who hit me
up and they're like, I love this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my favorite It's really good,
but I don't hear about those ones But the
[SPEAKER_03]: pie scream because of just the way that it
meshed There was a lot of people who found
[SPEAKER_03]: things where they're where they're talking
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it being reviewed I see it get
mentioned in multiple places and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, this is killer But you know the
flower sure, but they're not washing at a
[SPEAKER_03]: level that It's winning hash cups too
because it's too greasy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not producing So if you have
something where it's winning a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_03]: of flower cups a whole bunch of hash cups
You're hearing about it all over the
[SPEAKER_03]: place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like if that's not elite,
then there's no such thing as Italy like
[SPEAKER_03]: it Doesn't matter who made it or whether
you like the flavor you think that's not I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't like that kind of shit It's like you
objectively you have to say yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is a real crazy thing because it's
it's ball like I like Shout out to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know JJ a top dog because like take
star dog for instance, which is older but
[SPEAKER_00]: still modern There's the Corey Haim.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the guava.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the Kate Upton.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably one or two There's at
least three or four, you know There's at
[SPEAKER_00]: least three or four named Finos that are
still traded and available at clone
[SPEAKER_00]: sellers as of right now that you know,
he made that 15 years ago or whatever and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still bouncing around and it popped
from multiple different people and JJ
[SPEAKER_00]: never found any of those Finos that was
all found in seed he sold and then people
[SPEAKER_03]: found something they loved and we're like,
hey And people might know the Corey name
[SPEAKER_03]: and they don't they've never heard a star
dog And you're like, yeah that's start up
[SPEAKER_03]: in their life Like what's star dog?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like they know the cut more than the
cross and that shows a disconnect from
[SPEAKER_03]: Like something like I'm saying where
people hit me up directly and go dude I
[SPEAKER_03]: bought your seeds and I found this thing
and it's really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still a connect there where It's
still close to home, but there's these
[SPEAKER_03]: cuts where like the electric boogaloo
where it's like, holy shit It's like yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's an L5 Hayes But the people who have
it don't even know that because it stands
[SPEAKER_03]: alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to know that It's this
legendary cross or this popular cross or a
[SPEAKER_03]: breeder that you respect made it or
whatever It is elite weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just is that good where it rings bells
where you're like, yeah, that's that thing
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's you know, that's uh Yeah,
I think that's a one final thing on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Back in the day not to talk back in
the day But back in the day the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: any elite happened was it basically sort
of happened semi organically where it just
[SPEAKER_00]: spread amongst different heads And it
really only got popular if enough people
[SPEAKER_00]: loved it that there could be demand for it
and people wanted it and so now we have
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a situation with this modern
marketing that we talked about a little
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier in the chat where people can like
manufacture elites So there's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that like get pumped up and hyped but
don't stand the test of time the real to
[SPEAKER_00]: me test of an elite is 15 20 years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it still desirable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things we were talking about those
hazes those hazes are old Really old
[SPEAKER_00]: they're still desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know JJ was releasing Stardog
and like oh eight or I you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a long time ago They're still
traded and popular people still want them
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the same thing with like music
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like is it going to be a flash in the pan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it going to be 20 years later?
[SPEAKER_00]: People are still buying the album Because
you know It is and so there's a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: amount the real true elites The only thing
that that that separates them is time So
[SPEAKER_00]: probably this stuff you're talking about
right now that just won the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: competition if it's got multiple phenos
that are doing amazing and flower and hash
[SPEAKER_00]: competitions It's on its way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's a real true amazing elite,
then people will be wanting it 10 or 15
[SPEAKER_03]: years from now Yeah, and it's gonna
parent.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna parent future elites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they spawn families.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah It's like you said there's you
there's the plant then there's the the
[SPEAKER_03]: smoker and the grower who's like hey Can I
get that plant because I want to grow it
[SPEAKER_03]: and I want to smoke it then there's the
buyer who's like I want to buy that shit
[SPEAKER_03]: from you and then there's more growers who
are like I got to get that because the
[SPEAKER_03]: buyers want to buy it from me and then it
just keeps on going like and so it's it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like when people try to downplay anything
that is Really really popular and say that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's only hype.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always tell them like maybe it's running
partially on hype and maybe it's Overrated
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's too much hype, but I've seen
plenty of people take a plant and go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is the one right here and Sorry,
but it has to actually Like people have to
[SPEAKER_03]: like it if they don't like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't just create a whole Big movement
of people really wanting this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like the case with cookies at first
Some people had it some people didn't and
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of people were like heads bullshit
None of this is any good and I was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, whatever and I was given animal
cookies and I didn't even flower it and I
[SPEAKER_03]: finally flowered it and a dude showed up
who didn't who had never even heard of
[SPEAKER_03]: cookies and looked at it and was like I'll
give you like double what I'll give you
[SPEAKER_03]: for anything else for That shit right
there and I was like, oh you have people
[SPEAKER_03]: who want it and he goes no, dude I just
want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just know what it is I can just take one
look at that shit and I just it's animal
[SPEAKER_03]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I I want it like That's what I need all
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you got at that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and I already knew it was good I
knew I had a lot of resin because the
[SPEAKER_03]: pound was like this big.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, yeah, it's good Then I smoked
it and I was like, okay I actually got
[SPEAKER_03]: high and it kind of made me feel a little
weird I smoked some of it like backstage a
[SPEAKER_03]: reggae on the river and I kind of was a
little bit like Weird it out and I was
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking really heavy at the time and I was
like, all right There's a lot of something
[SPEAKER_03]: in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely not totally normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I went okay I just need to accept
that the reason this got so popular in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Bay Area was because it's pretty good
fucking weed and After all said and done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still like, yeah It's really good and
I've seen a lot of cookies that I thought
[SPEAKER_03]: sucked and I've seen a lot of stuff
related that I didn't think was that good
[SPEAKER_03]: but I've never seen anything that got the
only thing that I can think of that got
[SPEAKER_03]: really big for a little wave that always
pops up as being the same one everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: always mentions is purple punch and Still
I still look at it like or the other one
[SPEAKER_03]: too that you would know from up here was
Barry white Yeah, but there's still and
[SPEAKER_03]: nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry Let's go one more deeper and go to
that old flow cut that everybody renamed
[SPEAKER_00]: black Blackberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and they sold the hell out of that
and it totally was those those plants are
[SPEAKER_03]: the ones that was like there was something
so good about them that it tricked
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody but it wasn't even Back those
ones were organically hyped before the
[SPEAKER_03]: purple purple punch was internet hype.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like from photographs But like that
the blackberry was hyped because the
[SPEAKER_03]: grower loved to grow it the smoker if
you're already Smoking a bunch of stony
[SPEAKER_03]: dope and you try it like back in the day I
couldn't notice if weed wasn't strong
[SPEAKER_03]: because I just smoked three joints of some
other shit that was real strong and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking bh o and bubble hash and Dry
sieved hash and I'm just like sitting here
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking everything and you smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, ooh, that's tasty Yeah,
you're not gonna go Oh, I'm not high
[SPEAKER_03]: because you're still running off the high
from the last two hours of smoking five
[SPEAKER_03]: different types of shit Then you're just
convinced.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's good It's great and then buyers
start getting it who only have a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bag of weed and they're like This doesn't
do anything and you're like, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: look at in the morning you smoke it in the
morning nothing happens Like real elites
[SPEAKER_00]: like this is kind of crazy too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can take sour diesel for a minute
There's probably gonna be real elites that
[SPEAKER_00]: like are in fashion They go out of
fashion, but then they're so good that
[SPEAKER_00]: they come back into fashion again later
Because it's like there was enough
[SPEAKER_00]: Downtime where a bunch of new smokers come
in and they're like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of happened Yeah,
so oh gee the sour like it's just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Led Zeppelin made its last album
in 1979 but there's some kid in high
[SPEAKER_00]: school.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like blown away by And like they
just and like they're gonna go out there
[SPEAKER_00]: and so it like re grabs new people So to
me, that's what an elite is It's like
[SPEAKER_00]: something that stands the test of time
Because you can hype whatever but like
[SPEAKER_00]: over time the only thing that will keep it
that good is It it having an organic base
[SPEAKER_00]: of people that think it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah in a nutshell a hundred percent,
you know the the checklist to greatness is
[SPEAKER_01]: not short by any means and while we're
talking about special plants that works
[SPEAKER_01]: out nicely because I wanted to chat about
a very special plant the USDA has recently
[SPEAKER_01]: approved a genetically modified cannabis
or hemp plant that produces neither THC
[SPEAKER_01]: nor CBD the strain nubbed dubbed badger G
does not produce either and instead only
[SPEAKER_01]: produces CBG it's actually the second
plant to get approved that's genetically
[SPEAKER_01]: modified after another plant that just
produces very low levels of THC and CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: was approved this strain was developed by
the University of Wisconsin and they
[SPEAKER_01]: created it by knocking out a critical gene
called Cannabidiolic acid synthase which
[SPEAKER_01]: is a gene which essentially bottlenecks
the conversion of CBG into THC or CBD Thus
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant is not capable of producing
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'd love to know anyone have any
thoughts about this any concerns Where are
[SPEAKER_01]: we headed next and do we have any concern
about cross pollination with this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder with our normal THC producing
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean with the dangers of THC and CBD
being so high I'm actually campaigning for
[SPEAKER_03]: us to genetically modify a plant that
actually doesn't produce a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already invented it and I've
completely modified it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called invisible girl.
[SPEAKER_03]: I dropped it years ago and it's actually
really popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't seem to really see it on the
market, but it is invisible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's big and it's not even normally
invisible.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's things that are invisible that you
can still actually touch, but this is
[SPEAKER_03]: actually inter-dimensionally invisible and
I've patented that term and trademarked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also invented the patenting of
terminology for invisible girl and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: outstanding and it's fully safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have all the harm reduction is
significant when compared to THC or CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: which are historically air is much
healthier chemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just figured while we're at it,
let's just do away with the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: While we're doing it, let's just get rid
of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just have weed with no CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should get rid of the fiber.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get rid of the fiber.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just basically going to modify out
everything useful and valuable and it
[SPEAKER_03]: could be considered noble by any culture
out of the weed and then I think we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be really successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have big investors on the line and we're
going to take off here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let Francis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only riff I'll say on that is all
agriculture except for weed works hand in
[SPEAKER_00]: hand with universities developing shit
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's corn or soybeans or apples or
any kind of plant that a lot of times a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the research and development is
done at like UC Iowa or UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Various colleges that are famous for
agriculture in different regions around
[SPEAKER_00]: the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: As hemp becomes a big commodity product,
you're going to get professors and PhDs
[SPEAKER_00]: and graduate students messing around with
the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no different than that mustard plant
that you bread it into cauliflower,
[SPEAKER_00]: broccoli, mustard greens, Brussels
sprouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start adapting weed for
very specific needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what CBG does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not super big on all the CBD,
CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that funny thing of like it's an
amazing tonic for everything and it also
[SPEAKER_00]: does nothing and it's amazing because you
can't feel it or you can't sense the
[SPEAKER_00]: change but it's really positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that you're talking about cross
contamination or pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be curious to know are they growing
fields of males and females that are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be throwing off pollen or is it going
to be a bunch of feminized stuff grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: crops because there might not be any
pollen in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most large scale cannabis or hemp
projects do seem to be heading in the
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There doesn't seem to be a lot of like 100
acre plots of like raw male and females
[SPEAKER_00]: just like throwing off pollen these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there are any money making
cannabinoids from THC to CBD to CBG to
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, I would expect universities and
private groups to start playing around
[SPEAKER_00]: with the genome and the thing about CBG
which probably you know is like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: all these restrictions in the farm bill
and stuff on how much THC you can have and
[SPEAKER_00]: how much this you can have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those things might just be like a
problem or an impediment to like breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: in that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they're going to do with
the CBG but if they can find some
[SPEAKER_00]: marketable extract or reason to have CBG
then maybe crispering some weed to make
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG is worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right like I don't particularly that's not
the direction that I would ever go but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's silly to think humans take plants and
animals and we wildly mess with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's okay so here's a cool example you
guys like there are paintings from like
[SPEAKER_00]: 500 years ago of vegetables that you can
go look up and if you go look up 500 year
[SPEAKER_00]: old watermelon you will see these
watermelons that have like little pockets
[SPEAKER_00]: of red full of seeds and most of it is
like white pith that you can't use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the last 500 years we've bred
these watermelons to be almost entirely
[SPEAKER_00]: within the shell right juicy red no pith a
lot of times no seed you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've never been able to work on weed
before universities and agriculture is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take a look and I would expect to
have over the next 20 or 30 years hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: that is extremely specific for fiber
that's extremely specific for like certain
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids that's extremely specific for
you know maybe like we were talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier maybe extra botanical extracts
that produce high levels of terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: if there's money in it they'll try to
isolate it and they'll try to get plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that produce it at a high level and if all
they want out of it is that terpene or
[SPEAKER_00]: that CBG or that fiber they'll breed to
the exclusivity of everything else because
[SPEAKER_00]: all the rest of that shit's just in the
way you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up until the farm bill I don't think
universities you can correct me if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong but I think you used to be able
until four or five years ago you had to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the DEA's permission to do anything
with weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I mean hemp used to be just as
illegal as anything and I mean that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: funny thing with you know like when when
CBD stuff started being a thing you know
[SPEAKER_03]: people would be like oh this is cannabis
this is cannabis CBD this is hemp CBD and
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like it's all like the hemp is all
cannabis guys like this is not a that's
[SPEAKER_03]: not a thing and it always tripped me out
to here but that was because as a
[SPEAKER_03]: government definition there was there was
a difference at a certain point but yeah I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean I totally agree like you're gonna
have I can't remember at a certain point I
[SPEAKER_03]: remember somebody telling me oh CBG is
really good because it's like it's good
[SPEAKER_03]: for anti-anxiety or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember what it was but it does
have a value to it you know and as far as
[SPEAKER_03]: I know like CBG is like the precursor to
the other things that are more commonly
[SPEAKER_03]: valued you know and so you yeah you just
need to basically make it so that instead
[SPEAKER_03]: of it hitting that certain point where it
turns into other things it just keeps on
[SPEAKER_03]: producing this thing and it never stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you read that thing about how they're
developing like strains of yeast or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever to grow cannabinoids without even
using plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna do that in every direction
as soon as you make it legal and you allow
[SPEAKER_00]: these universities and these research
groups and these farmers to start playing
[SPEAKER_00]: around with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Playing around with plants to produce
things we want them to produce is ancient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I know that I mean they're gonna we
already have gone from a point so
[SPEAKER_03]: originally when you had a medicine it
would have been a chemical that was
[SPEAKER_03]: derived from a plant and you and you know
everything is basically these these carbon
[SPEAKER_03]: chains and these little these molecules
that have these little tweaks to them and
[SPEAKER_03]: it makes it a little bit different and you
go from having mescaline to have an
[SPEAKER_03]: ecstasy or you go from having this to
having that everything is just slightly
[SPEAKER_03]: different and what they figured out at a
certain point was basically that you just
[SPEAKER_03]: need a source of a carbon and so they
started using petroleum based carbon and
[SPEAKER_03]: so that's why a lot of the medicines and
everything that we have they're inherently
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of toxic versus the natural plant
versions of them when they make synthetic
[SPEAKER_03]: opioids and all these other things right
they're just naturally made from this
[SPEAKER_03]: weird shit it's like almost like somewhere
between gasoline and Vaseline and plastic
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's these little chains that are
the right length where they can tweak them
[SPEAKER_03]: in a lab and use them as these bases for
other shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as far as I understand it because of
the nature of how yeasts are you can use
[SPEAKER_03]: them if you mess with them the right way
to produce almost anything that in nature
[SPEAKER_03]: is a carbon based molecule that makes a
chemical so not only can you make
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids but you can also make other
things with yeast to where you can make
[SPEAKER_03]: like a lot of medicines and different
things with yeast and as weird as it
[SPEAKER_03]: sounds they might be significantly more
healthy than petroleum based carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we have a cannabinoid system we're
now in the infancy of they used to also
[SPEAKER_00]: with the DEA the DEA only used to give
permission to study cannabis and hemp and
[SPEAKER_00]: weed looking for harm right they would
only approve like if you were like I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to see if it like reduces inflammation or
lowers my blood pressure they would deny
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual raw material needed to study it
so they've only loosened up recently to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow people so you have this situation
right now where you have this thing that's
[SPEAKER_00]: been in use in humans for a really long
time we have a cannabinoid system that it
[SPEAKER_00]: affects and we barely know how it works
and I would expect over the next decades
[SPEAKER_00]: there to be an explosion in studying it
because most medicine whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: penicillin or aspirin or this or that or
whatever a lot of times a lot of medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of treatments come out of
studying natural right like naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring things concentrating them
purifying them seeing how they work with
[SPEAKER_00]: the human body and then being like oh just
like that like this is crazy but like they
[SPEAKER_00]: you know they had that you know they have
they have all these weight loss drugs now
[SPEAKER_00]: that were developed for diabetes and then
they did and then they discovered that
[SPEAKER_00]: people are now they're like ozone pack or
whatever they all are so getting back to
[SPEAKER_00]: weed and hemp all these CBN CBG CBD THC
all that we are in the very very very
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of actually looking at what
these how these things affect us we have
[SPEAKER_00]: all this like like anecdotal evidence I
might have mispronounced it or whatever we
[SPEAKER_00]: have all this like in the field evidence
of like what people perceive it does but
[SPEAKER_00]: like even with all this like legal testing
I can't look at a chart and be like oh
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got these terpenes it's got this THC
percentage it's got this mix it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: make me feel like so I don't know that
eventually we'll be able scientifically to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out what blends of what do what I
don't know how far away we are from all
[SPEAKER_00]: that but universities breeding stuff and
doing specific things they might need to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed specific cannabinoids just so they
can study what that cannabinoid does by
[SPEAKER_00]: itself without influence from THC or CBD
or CBN or whatever 100% and even in older
[SPEAKER_03]: literature they tell you you know that
there might be three or four hundred
[SPEAKER_03]: different useful drugs that are in
cannabis in general you know what I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: and when you test for things he you know
you get the you get this coa that says
[SPEAKER_03]: what it was tested for it doesn't tell you
about the things that it wasn't tested for
[SPEAKER_00]: so we only yeah we only test for a small
amount of cannabinoids so yeah and then
[SPEAKER_03]: like you saying earlier with like the with
like the the the Batman and Joker thing
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like okay so now what happens when
you mix this type of chemical with this
[SPEAKER_03]: chemical with that chemical and the
interaction between all these different
[SPEAKER_03]: molecules it's like it's not all just okay
you take okay alcohol does this and
[SPEAKER_03]: Tylenol does this like no alcohol and
Tylenol it's a deadly combination right
[SPEAKER_03]: but you you don't know that unless you
have them separate if you had a plant that
[SPEAKER_03]: produced both you'd be like this thing is
deadly toxic and it would be like no
[SPEAKER_03]: actually it has two very valuable
chemicals in them yeah they're separate
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to use them separately but this
one is sometimes the same chemical you
[SPEAKER_00]: know botulism which kills you yeah Botox
which takes away my wrinkles yeah so so me
[SPEAKER_03]: and my son we watched this we watched this
show on Netflix and it's called 72
[SPEAKER_03]: deadliest animals and it's they have like
the South America version the Asia version
[SPEAKER_03]: the Africa version right and you watch it
and they'll tell you this animal has this
[SPEAKER_03]: deadly venom and without fail every time
you get through this show they say you
[SPEAKER_03]: know like they go through and they go what
this happens you get paralysis and then
[SPEAKER_03]: necrosis and this thing happens and that
thing happens and then they get all the
[SPEAKER_03]: way to the end and they go scientists
right now in Argentina are studying this
[SPEAKER_03]: because it turns out that this chemical if
you use it this way is actually a cure for
[SPEAKER_03]: this and you're like oh so essentially
everything that is a really outstanding
[SPEAKER_03]: toxin is some kind of an incredible
medicine but you have to know the dosage
[SPEAKER_03]: and the right way to use it so it's like
oh if you inject it it's terrible but if
[SPEAKER_03]: you eat it when it hits your gut it does
this it turns out or whatever if you put
[SPEAKER_03]: it in your ear it's like oh shit okay so
every and that's the nature like of
[SPEAKER_03]: everything you know as like every every
poison that's why they say it's the it's
[SPEAKER_03]: the dose you know like yeah I would
imagine they made it so they could just
[SPEAKER_00]: study CBG as an isolated cannabinoid
without anything else and if it ends up
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming popular it'll only because they
can put it in some kind of consumer
[SPEAKER_03]: product that people want to buy and a lot
of the motivation I figure initially comes
[SPEAKER_03]: from them wanting to go oh we're gonna
sell CBG and we have this idea because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's gonna be this thing and we're gonna
make the new suppository and then you buy
[SPEAKER_03]: our CBG you know but the thing about all
that is like you said it has it has a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of a lot of value the same way I'm talking
about the toxin science and studies and
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know modification and CRISPR and
all these things they're the same way like
[SPEAKER_03]: it's you know you can it's like they say
you know you can eat with the fork or you
[SPEAKER_03]: can stab yourself in the leg but like it's
not the same it's still the same thing so
[SPEAKER_03]: this plant that they've modified like you
said if it's male female and the pollens
[SPEAKER_03]: flying everywhere and it's basically
getting all the way into the atmosphere
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's now there's modified stuff and
it's lowering the you know the the global
[SPEAKER_03]: quality of all of our different things
that's fucked up but if they're making
[SPEAKER_03]: like polyploids and it won't breed with
anything else and it produces very few
[SPEAKER_03]: males and all that kind of stuff it's like
it's not so bad the thing I think that
[SPEAKER_03]: gave the GMOs a really bad name and it's
important for people to understand this
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think most people don't understand
it is the fact that genetically modifying
[SPEAKER_03]: things so far has mainly been used by
people who want to modify things so that
[SPEAKER_03]: you can spray them with roundup roundup
ready crops have been used and the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: thing is a scam to be able to sell more
herbicides and they're like oh it's gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: save people from world hunger and I'm like
look by the time you have the ability to
[SPEAKER_03]: genetically modify things you guys could
do a lot of things to modify to help to
[SPEAKER_03]: solve world hunger there's a lot of traits
that are really really commercially
[SPEAKER_03]: valuable that you can incorporate super
easily into these things that are not just
[SPEAKER_03]: hey we can hit the whole fucking planet
with Agent Orange now and it won't matter
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like no it that's not a good idea but
the idea for them was like we get more
[SPEAKER_03]: profits here and we get more profits here
like we have the disease we have the cure
[SPEAKER_03]: we have this thing like you know it would
be great if you could do this but you know
[SPEAKER_03]: what would make you do better is if you
could just spray your whole field with
[SPEAKER_03]: roundup and then you wouldn't have to
worry about it and that is horrible but at
[SPEAKER_03]: the same time you look at stuff and you go
okay so if you if you modify things in
[SPEAKER_03]: certain ways and you go through the due
diligence of figuring out like you said
[SPEAKER_03]: you know like is this gonna spread be a
pollen is this gonna be you know there's
[SPEAKER_03]: all these things you can do to make things
so that like okay well we also modified it
[SPEAKER_03]: so that it cannot reproduce outside of our
reproduction techniques there's no they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna they're gonna want to figure out too
like which why why does weed make what
[SPEAKER_00]: part what what aspect makes it anti-nausea
what what which substance reduces
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation because inflammation leads to
so much disease if they can figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated you know isolated compounds that
help reduce inflammation you know like
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna look at anything positive
that can come out of hemp or canna and try
[SPEAKER_00]: to figure out what components actually
make that happen you know and and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think that's just gonna continue you
know so I just I expect to see dozens upon
[SPEAKER_00]: dozens upon dozens of those type of
articles over the next years because as
[SPEAKER_00]: people start to play with things they're
gonna take it in different directions and
[SPEAKER_00]: they might just be taking it in different
directions so they can study it further so
[SPEAKER_00]: they can extract whatever it is pure and
then start to play with it by itself and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know like anything else it's gonna be
a tool and there could be good and bad
[SPEAKER_00]: there might even be stuff that we think is
amazing that comes out of it that later on
[SPEAKER_00]: we're like that was bad yeah that's how
humans are you know it's like I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: when people invented styrofoam they were
like this is the bomb look at how many
[SPEAKER_00]: different things we can make into it look
at how durable it is look at how well it
[SPEAKER_00]: holds up to heat and this and that and
then 50 years later we're like oh this
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't dissolve it's just like that's
basically what I think of GMO weed is
[SPEAKER_00]: universities are gonna get a hold of it
and they're gonna apply their their
[SPEAKER_00]: science and they're gonna apply their labs
and they're gonna apply their technology
[SPEAKER_00]: like they do to all kinds of other plants
and they're gonna see what comes of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: it might lead down bad paths and it might
lead to interesting interesting ideas or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever or they could be talking about
weed and canna as the wonder drug because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's spawned this whole new class of drugs
that is helping with whatever that we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't even know what it's called the tree
leaf in which he has heard threatening his
[SPEAKER_01]: girlfriend and what appears to be hitting
her there's no video so we can't
[SPEAKER_01]: corroborate that entirely but it does
sound to me that way now there's numerous
[SPEAKER_01]: issues at play here obviously it goes
without saying violence against women is
[SPEAKER_01]: never acceptable and not surprisingly many
people have distanced themselves from him
[SPEAKER_01]: within the professional community and
landscape interestingly a somewhat vocal
[SPEAKER_01]: group of people have come out saying that
he should not be supported to the point
[SPEAKER_01]: that his seeds are and clones should be
thrown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It begs the question that has been around
for many years already about separating
[SPEAKER_01]: the art from the artist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question becomes, what do you guys
think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the seeds know anything about the
actions of their creator or is this simply
[SPEAKER_01]: too big of an issue to ignore?
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal perspective, not to put it on
anybody else, is that I always like to
[SPEAKER_00]: separate the seeds and the plant from the
person, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the line that I would draw is if
you look at that and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not my kind of person, then you
should not support anything that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing currently or in the future if your
values don't align with that person's.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean that the seeds that
they made eight years ago or a clone that
[SPEAKER_00]: they released is somehow contaminated and
should be eliminated because that person
[SPEAKER_00]: did some nasty stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see not wanting to support that
person in the future because there's tons
[SPEAKER_00]: of other breeders you can support and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no shortage, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been a weird thing in the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even want to name names because
it's like people will get upset,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's people that have been accused
of ratting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people that have been accused of
working with the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of breeders or people that have
contributed to Kana maybe haven't had the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest personal lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not to excuse them or say you
should support them in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't know about if you got seeds
from five years ago about flushing them
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're contaminated from touching
a bad person.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a similar view of it in that
statistically, just looking at how things
[SPEAKER_03]: work, you can imagine that it's pretty
likely that anything that you really like
[SPEAKER_03]: that you have probably at one point went
through somebody's... It's probably got
[SPEAKER_03]: some weird stories attached to it,
attached to some weird people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just because you don't know it makes
you think, oh, well, this one's better
[SPEAKER_03]: than that one over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know these groups that were
basically the outsiders in society who
[SPEAKER_03]: held a lot of the genetics and people in
general.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know for a fact that a lot of people who
were the people who grew weed back in the
[SPEAKER_03]: day, these people were the people who
batched up meth, who did really crazy
[SPEAKER_03]: shit, who definitely were hyper violent in
certain cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a lot of ties with organized
crime.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of different organizations
that are associated with certain genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just is a reality of the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I would say possibly is kind of an
easy fix and not normally something that I
[SPEAKER_03]: would say is good because I'm fond of
history and accuracy.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really, really, really can't
stomach these type of people you maybe can
[SPEAKER_03]: leapfrog them a little bit in the
storyline to say that this guy,
[SPEAKER_03]: did he really do any really novel work?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know him personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see what he did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only know what I saw online basically
and what is represented there as the
[SPEAKER_03]: story.
[SPEAKER_03]: But from what I can tell I don't know that
he actually did anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could probably just skip over the
dude in the saga and go, let's just jump
[SPEAKER_03]: back to the guy right before who he
actually stole all the shit from in the
[SPEAKER_03]: first place, if that's the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if he did really make some
crosses, it's pretty easy to say,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is this crossed with this and this is
what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the normal honor that you bestow on
somebody that you know is hella cool,
[SPEAKER_03]: like Bodhi or something where you're like,
yeah, this was Acapulco gold and it was
[SPEAKER_03]: gathered by these dudes and this is the
story.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, Bodhi got it at one point,
increased it and I got the seeds from
[SPEAKER_03]: Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you add in Bodhi even if he didn't
really do anything and he doesn't want any
[SPEAKER_03]: credit for it because it's not his stuff,
but he, you know, he's the one who brought
[SPEAKER_03]: it to have everybody be able to get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you want him to have his place in
history because you know, he's honorable
[SPEAKER_03]: in terms of the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's honorable in terms of the way he
treats people in general and his general
[SPEAKER_03]: outlook and the things he does and his
energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That attaches to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, Oh, like, you know,
like it's almost like if, if Bodhi got the
[SPEAKER_03]: shit from this dude and then you got it
from Bodhi, you'd be like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it from Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's this cool stuff now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you know, like you got it from him
cause you've met the dude and the vibe was
[SPEAKER_03]: cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not that worried about the dude
before who was an asshole or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost feel like in this case,
you could kind of just kind of like,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, let's pull just like an old school
history move where you just kind of bust
[SPEAKER_03]: the face off.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idol.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, well, I don't know which
Pharaoh this was, you know, like that's
[SPEAKER_03]: like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you disagree with what the dude did,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is not hard to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just say, I'm not going to give
him any money or support him in any of his
[SPEAKER_00]: future endeavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean any clone or seed he
produced years ago or something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be like eliminated from the gene
pool because like, there's not like,
[SPEAKER_00]: he didn't attach any karmic debt to those
seeds or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, he's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stories up here that we
don't tell, you know, like Mendo,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like old weed world was never
this magical land.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of ugliness on some of these
famous roads.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot, there's addictions,
there's violence, there's weird stories
[SPEAKER_00]: that aren't the greatest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people that are very flawed
individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, imagine if you believe never,
and you were like, okay, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Sam ratted me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's eliminate skunk and haze from any
future work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just ditch both of those things
because he got me arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through, you know, like if you believe
his story, it doesn't paint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying like, if you believe it,
it paints him in a pretty bad light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a lot of shade balls in
Kana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can choose who you give your
money to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you should spend your money with
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that whose values you align with if
you so choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and if you don't want to give that
dude any money because you saw the IG and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, man, he's an aggressive
asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to give my weed money to
someone who's not that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of breeders, you know,
that you can spend your money on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got those seeds from someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got those cuts from someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody stands on the shoulder of others
at best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us are just.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mildly altering things here or there and
passing along to the next person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in some cases, like there's,
you know, there's times when it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, you actually really, somebody really
did do a step that makes it so that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: like, oh, and then this person did this
step.
[SPEAKER_03]: In some cases, it's like somebody just
sold something and they attached their
[SPEAKER_03]: name to it and they didn't actually take
any steps except reselling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if that's the case, you're like,
well, I mean, this guy was the source,
[SPEAKER_03]: but if he didn't actually even do anything
to it, he didn't even like, this guy
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't even have to the shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just somebody else's thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he just, he bred it with a Sharpie
marker on a label.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I, I don't know the dude's story,
but I, but, but there are definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned of people saying like,
Oh, that clone that he sells for 20 grand
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was just so-and-so's clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he changed the name and he said he
bred it and he didn't breed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, all right, well,
if that's the case, I see no reason to
[SPEAKER_03]: have added his name to the story in the
first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you should probably just call it the
name it was before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause this whole thing was an error,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Historical error.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't spend 20 grand on a clone and
don't give him the 20 grand if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to buy a clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you, if you did, and you find
out that the clone was originally named
[SPEAKER_03]: someone else and it's bred by somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you buy this thing and it's called
super Hayes and you spade 20 grand for it
[SPEAKER_03]: and it turns out, Oh, it's actually a
five, then you should have stopped calling
[SPEAKER_03]: it super Hayes a long time ago and stop
mentioning this guy as a guy who did
[SPEAKER_03]: anything in it and just start calling it a
five again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's not even historically accurate.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no reason to add the name,
but I don't know the details to know if
[SPEAKER_03]: that is exactly the case or people
exaggerated it and he did F to it or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's this different thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know any of that,
but what I am saying is that if anybody,
[SPEAKER_03]: if anybody like can't stomach to say his
name, cause they don't even want to give
[SPEAKER_03]: him the credit of adding to cause you,
if you, if somebody says, Hey,
[SPEAKER_03]: where'd you get this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you say, Oh, I got it from not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then people are going to be like,
Oh, well, even if this dude said not,
[SPEAKER_03]: so it's not cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to hit him up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I want to get that, you know,
like if somebody says, Oh, I got it from
[SPEAKER_03]: mean gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, then they're like, Oh,
but he's a bad dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be like, I mean,
James caught it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's the guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to like erase the name,
because you can't stomach doing that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that you like, you got it from me and you
think I'm bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you can always leave the name out of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that doesn't set.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not giving an advertisement for
this guy over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I said, that's like more of the
hot take because the way I look at it is
[SPEAKER_03]: more like, all right, if the dude did any
bit of work, that is part of the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: And history is full of the, like you said,
it's full of the dirty part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: history.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're really a historian and you're
like, Oh, skunk man, if you really believe
[SPEAKER_03]: the story of that skunk man, Sam was a
rat, but you still want to grow the stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: that he bred.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you want to have that positronics haze
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, Oh, but Sam back in the
day, like you could always say,
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it was an old Santa Cruz strain and I
got it from Positron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can add another element to what you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was doing the history podcast there
for a couple of years, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of stories where certain
salacious details just get left out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tail because you don't want to be a
negative person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be rumor mongering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be obviously that dude
had a video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like proof or whatever,
but generally speaking under the hood and
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of Kana stories, there can be
violence, there can be addiction,
[SPEAKER_00]: there can be robbery, there can be
thieving.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be the whole range of human
activity also occurs in and around the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not immune, you know, there's
violence, there's lying, there's thieving,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's stealing, there's bad people,
you know, there's all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of times when you're like
trying to tell people like real history,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, man, do I want to like,
he did all this cool things in weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then his kids all think he's a scumbag
and he did this to their mom and he da da
[SPEAKER_00]: da da da.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, do you bring that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that pertinent?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is it rumor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to, like, do you want to
repeat the rumor as fact and like
[SPEAKER_00]: disparage somebody's character?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's edit and I'll say this too,
is that genetics are forever and everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: gets forgotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, if, if that dude
touched something that was valuable,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guarantee you 20, 30 years from now,
if that thing, if whatever he has is still
[SPEAKER_00]: around, most people will have no idea it
came from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you asked people to name the top three
or four people that were involved in sour,
[SPEAKER_00]: most people couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all going to be forgotten.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you study the history, if you want
to know, like, oh, you want to know about
[SPEAKER_03]: like the Holy Roman empire, like you want
to know about the lineage of the European
[SPEAKER_03]: kings, coming from France and England,
or you want to know about like,
[SPEAKER_03]: like you can't just like history doesn't
work in a way where you can just go ahead
[SPEAKER_03]: and, uh, we're going to admit all the
stuff that's ugly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause when you really look at it,
you're like, I hate to tell you guys,
[SPEAKER_03]: but like you're what, there's not going to
be anything left when you relate things in
[SPEAKER_03]: certain avenues.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, don't get to know your heroes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's all that guy in the rolling
stone married his 14 year old cousin,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and he was 40 and you're like,
Oh, or this person did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, Oh no, that's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, and you can just,
people are complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not to excuse dude,
because obviously like being an asshole to
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone, much less someone you're in a
relationship with, or you have some age on
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't, the, the video does not look
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I could absolutely see people
deciding I'm not going to give that person
[SPEAKER_00]: any more of my money because there's
dozens or hundreds of other people out
[SPEAKER_00]: there in the weed community that I don't
feel that way towards that when I have
[SPEAKER_00]: money to burn, I'll just spend it with
them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if, you know, if you're somebody who's
actually like in these kinds of people's
[SPEAKER_03]: lives where like he's your good,
good buddy, like you need to try to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, if you have some kind of loyalty
to him where even though he did something
[SPEAKER_03]: like that, you're still, he's still your
friend and you're like, uh, you're
[SPEAKER_03]: completely aghast and taken aback.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what is that dude doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to be trying to, you know,
help your friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that guy's your friend to try to be a
better person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you are, you know, that girl's dad
or brother or whatever, you're probably
[SPEAKER_03]: going to want to fuck him up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That actual storyline, like everybody on
the internet who will never actually see
[SPEAKER_03]: this guy, it's not really affecting your
plant that you light up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is totally different.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not, you know, it hasn't,
they're two different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only person I ever saw on the forums
get fully canceled for a while for their
[SPEAKER_00]: actions was Rez.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even after that, he still has a
comeback and sell seeds and there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's nuance to the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like you can, you know,
I'm not, I'm not trying to defend anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that like, you know,
lots of people do lots of bad things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are elevated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that video was ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody likes to see some dude in their
forties or fifties, like berating or,
[SPEAKER_00]: or yelling at some, like what you look to
be much, much younger female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't a good
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a good audio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably makes your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crawl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, you know, that dude will have
to decide like how he wants, like he was
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, he has to decide how he wants to
be as a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does he want to offer a big apology?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does he want to try to make it right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does he, maybe he's just an asshole and,
uh, you know, there's assholes that make
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody has to like, uh,
analyze like, what does this have to do
[SPEAKER_03]: with, with their life and what does this
have to do with their plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what does this have to do with
whatever?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all very interesting in these times
when everything is basically like you have
[SPEAKER_03]: access to all of this information.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, guess what guys, there's a lot
of bad apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not giving Belief any money,
any of my money, but I don't think I ever
[SPEAKER_00]: knew anyway, my money before ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, there's no change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weren't looking for the next that,
you know, you're like, I've seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't approve of him, but it doesn't
like, you know, and, uh, doesn't change
[SPEAKER_00]: your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: No canceled forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, you know, like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in, in, even in, in public Kana
world, it was pretty ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're like, he was saying about the
brother or father or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've, if you've got a daughter,
if you've got a sister, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, nobody wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to be talked to like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not, you know, but I mean,
that's the thing is like, that's what
[SPEAKER_03]: that's some people's life, but it's not 10
million people on the internet's life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that's why the question here is
posed by our boy as what does that mean
[SPEAKER_03]: about the plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that mean about this?
[SPEAKER_03]: As opposed to like, what, what,
what about this guy?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, well, the guy, what the fuck do
we know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like about that in our life, who this guy
is, I don't know the guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a guy is definitely not a good
guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a guy support.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, you know, like,
yeah, that you're going to be disgusted
[SPEAKER_03]: hearing it and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then it's crazy because you're like,
yeah, guys, there's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Billions of people and a lot of them are
doing really fucked up shit all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of it is a lot crazier than
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're never going to mention it,
but because we're in this wee bubble,
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody's like, I'm burning my seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm flushing my clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing this and that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, cool, you know,
but it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The level of, you know, every time there's
something like this in the weed world with
[SPEAKER_03]: the thing, it's like, you're talking about
the rez dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you hear the interview with,
with a gypsy or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, I forgive them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really care.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, well, everybody else is
very concerned.
[SPEAKER_03]: About this, but the guy who he says he
snitched on the guy that says the guy's
[SPEAKER_03]: like, yeah, he snitched on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, but there's like three
million 22 year olds who are deeply
[SPEAKER_03]: offended.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, I'm like, yeah,
you did it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: God help me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not defending ratting, but I will say
that I know people that have been put into
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the feds are like, I know every
detail and I want you to corroborate some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these details that I already know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want you to say these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you say these things that
corroborate what we already know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll give you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we don't, you're going to be the
only person that didn't talk and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to throw the book at you and you're
going to be screwed forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I, you know, like some
people, some people will shut up and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and do the rap and some people will not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when the people, when the people
don't, the guy who got snitched out gypsy
[SPEAKER_03]: and his family and his boys and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they're angry and they do
something, I ain't going to judge them for
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your life happened to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's people that you do that to
a stranger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to fuck with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to be my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want you to roll your seats,
but the fuck business is in the mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have multiple daughters and God help me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they never date anyone like
believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, look, it's a, you know, so a very
multi-faceted story, but you tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: what, the thing that shines through for me
the most about it all is that I bet you
[SPEAKER_01]: the people who had rez dog packs are
stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did not flush them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's certainly something to say
about separating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say that I'll say this about reds
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost everyone that has a sour seed line
secretly uses reds rezzes BX two as their
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen source, because sour is notoriously
hard to get to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost never throws pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't want to do their own work
because making a, a, a, a two time
[SPEAKER_00]: backcross is three separate breedings and
probably a year, a year and a half of your
[SPEAKER_00]: time or longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are any number of people
selling sour seeds out there that they got
[SPEAKER_00]: their pollen from that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it pop up a number, a number of
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you're onto something there and
I think it's about time we try the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the final segment for our first
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be out this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll call it heavy thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've, uh, I've got a little rant here and
I'd love to hear your guys thoughts on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this week or today, wherever we're
going to label it, I wanted to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: how I think that, uh, the, the grower has
to prioritize to grow some unique and
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you hear so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone wants to smoke sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone wants to smoke old school
strains, but so rarely do you find people
[SPEAKER_01]: actually speaking, uh, walking the walk,
talking the talk and growing it
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think as a, as Michael Jackson said,
starts with the man in the mirror,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to dedicate some space to some
longer flowering strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might just be like one or two
strains, one or two plants, but find
[SPEAKER_01]: something that you're interested in and
grow it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it be an experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it sit in the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might need to run across two flower
cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if you're running eight or nine week
is, but you'll be grateful for the
[SPEAKER_01]: experience, even if you're not
particularly thrilled by the flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I don't think will happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'll be very into it because at
the end of the day, the breath of our
[SPEAKER_01]: experience is limited by our exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you haven't grown these wild more
jungle type plants, you haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: experienced the full breadth of diversity
and unique characteristics that cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: has to offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll help you to grow better plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the nine week is, you know,
it'll give you a wider breadth of exposure
[SPEAKER_01]: and you'll be more skilled as a grower for
having grown them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will cross transfer to all plants
you grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you too can be, if you grow them out,
you can also be proud knowing that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: contributing in a beneficial way that
people are always aspiring, talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: growing something old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something unique, something longer
flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think overall everyone benefits from
greater diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no downsides and you can find a
type of effect that you may have never
[SPEAKER_01]: known existed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might lead you to like a lifelong
passion that you otherwise may have never
[SPEAKER_01]: seen or might've missed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd love to ask you guys, what do you
think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it as easy as I say, can you just chuck
a few Sally's in the corner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'll start on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this actually ties into sort of like,
I've been thinking about it for a while
[SPEAKER_00]: actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, with all the changes in the
scene, um, you know, a lot of us that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been into, into herb for a long time,
you know, we did various things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to for the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we would do things on the side
that were like for ourselves or for our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's actually a new breed of grower
that I kind of want to highlight on this
[SPEAKER_00]: one for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the hobbyist because I think that
a lot of these rare Sativas and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these rare things, like it used to be that
people that had a passion for it in weed
[SPEAKER_00]: would do it as a side to like what they
were actually doing to like survive and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's people out there that might be
mechanics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might have a different job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might have this or that, and they're
growing intense now and they're treating
[SPEAKER_00]: Kana like boating or hunting or dirt
biking or any other kind of like hobby
[SPEAKER_00]: that they pour money into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those people, because they're not
doing it for any kind of commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: status, they have complete freedom in what
they want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what we're talking about,
what you're talking about is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of people that were very
focused on the market in order to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have alternative income
streams, right, and you're growing for you
[SPEAKER_00]: and your friends or whatever, you can grow
110 day Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow weird things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pop some odd stuff from Mean Gene
that might have intersex traits or this or
[SPEAKER_00]: that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not be like commercially viable,
but like might have some really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting stuff in it and like not care
because you're just growing it for you and
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like there might not, there might
be a lot of weed out there that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: meet somebody's production model,
but they could still grow it on the side
[SPEAKER_00]: for them and their friends because there's
lots of weed that never makes it to
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even when I was, even when I was
doing depth, the headband or sour or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever else, there's two or three
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my friends, it's like you're
growing these to pay the bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got this little like bed
or this little greenie or this little
[SPEAKER_00]: patch that's like experiments or for you
and friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just gets passed around you and
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: People should try different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're only focused on money,
your survival, you probably won't,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and some people right now that
are in Canada that are just trying to hang
[SPEAKER_00]: on and to survive until better times,
they might have a hard time doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: financially because things are so tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but if you've got other income
streams, if you're a lawyer, if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanic, if you're this, if you're that,
and you've just got your, you've got an
[SPEAKER_00]: eight by eight veg and a little tent and
it's just your hobby, you have total
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow weird things that you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause all that matters if you and your
friend likes it, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot of that that's
starting to happen across America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those little pockets might be where
some of the non commercially viable,
[SPEAKER_00]: funnest, most interesting things end up
surviving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they're not surviving at big
warehouse grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those people aren't doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just growing whatever is the most,
whatever is the most profitable at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a thing like with, with all the
different things that I try to keep around
[SPEAKER_03]: are there's a, there's a certain amount
that are like, you know, I do have a good
[SPEAKER_03]: number of friends who are like,
they're growing dope.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want like something.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I have things where I'm like,
okay, well what's the market?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the things, what are the things
that people actually want so that I have
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds where I can give them to people and
be like, yeah, this is like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's different or that's like my take
on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my favorite stuff, like the lime,
I don't see it ever being anything that
[SPEAKER_03]: you would really, it's just not that easy
mechanically to manage it for like post
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest where it's like, okay,
bucking it down, trimming it, making it
[SPEAKER_03]: look nice, making it look like a certain
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just doesn't, it doesn't add up to be
ever these little round purple frosty buds
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can run through the machine trim
and it'll look like that thing that
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody wants to toss in their mylars.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to me, it's still like my favorite
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you like not so saying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are just interested in having
really cool weed, those are still the
[SPEAKER_03]: people that I'm focused on the most as far
as trying to get them seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I want people to basically get it and
go, you know, I never smoked weed like
[SPEAKER_03]: this before, or I did smoke weed that was
like this, but it's been like 30,
[SPEAKER_03]: 40 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember I had this one bag and I
haven't seen anything like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I grew this and there was,
it was kind of like, it's like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it was like that old weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, like I really liked
those odd things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as far as like the real long
flowering stuff, like right now I just
[SPEAKER_03]: popped like some, some Colombian and some
Congolese.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like just kind of odd.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I popped the Congolese purely so that
I can have a big weird bag of these thin
[SPEAKER_03]: little Congolese buds like this,
where it's like bump, bump, bump,
[SPEAKER_03]: bump, like little, you know, these little
rabbit heads up and down the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was these little marbles of this
cool weed and it grows on this plant with
[SPEAKER_03]: these tiny little stems and the leaves are
only this big and they're super narrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you look at the plant, you're like,
what is this thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you would never get very much weed if
you were trying to weigh it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you just want to have a couple
big like bundles of sticks of weed that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to smoke sitting somewhere
and you're just going to grab some of it
[SPEAKER_03]: and give some to somebody and smoke some
and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really great weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's neat stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't smell like what people want.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of grassy and it has this weird
like, you know, there's some turpentine
[SPEAKER_03]: and pining and it has this thing where
people are like, but when you smoke it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you really do feel different than when
you, like if you're used to weed and
[SPEAKER_03]: you've been smoking weed forever and you
smoke this, you're like, this,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is not like what I consider a weed
high.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll actually, I myself, but I'm weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm introspective with the highs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause as like a breeder, I like to kind of
figure out what does this feel like?
[SPEAKER_03]: So when people ask me to describe it,
but the really weed that gets you really
[SPEAKER_03]: high, that can be a really weird rabbit
hole.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you go, what the fuck is different?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't really put a finger on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like the Congo is like extra like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you're like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's really bright.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, everything is gone in a new
resolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's extra HD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're like in a video game and you
see as you move the layers of everything,
[SPEAKER_03]: all the depth is like very much
highlighted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're really, and all weed does that
a little bit, but it's like, the Congo is
[SPEAKER_03]: really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that where just like a classic weird
sativa high where all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_03]: everything's really different and you're
just kind of sitting there going,
[SPEAKER_03]: damn, this is not like the last weed that
I smoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's totally different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you feel really good just in general,
like where the whole negative,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you can get really fucked up and
like kind of swamped down and negativity
[SPEAKER_03]: at certain points.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think most people do,
but I definitely can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll, I'll like smoke that kind
of weed and I'll like be sitting there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one of the reasons why I like the
lime too, because I'll actually look at it
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'll be like, who the fuck was I when
I felt like negative?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when feeling bad was like a thing,
I don't even understand how that's a real
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, was I faking it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck was going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so weird, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's, and there's only,
you know, that when I smoked, like if I
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke like straight OG, it makes me feel
really high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really interesting how like high
I get, but I can still like kind of feel a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit like negative and kind of like
funky in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like almost like a different kind of
paranoia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas there's some weed where I'm just
like, dude, things are nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Life is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like fuck all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like very distinctly certain
types of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are the ones that I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I like to do that kind of
like the hobby thing of going,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, what is this one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what's that one like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you dig through all these things and
you discover there's things that make you
[SPEAKER_03]: feel different that you might consider
different than a weed high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you get to see the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole, I think most long flowering
things are going to be grown by hobbyists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have various good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to, I'm not actually going
to shout out who he is, but I have like a
[SPEAKER_00]: good friend of mine that grows,
he's got a tent and he grows seven or
[SPEAKER_00]: eight different sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's popping seeds from, from breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: He likes, he's growing them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's given some extras to friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really like, he's always growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always backing up moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes barely any money off it really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like he completely earns off a
different kind of career, but he's into
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants and he's into the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it does, he doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, Oh, if this PIF takes 112 days,
I really don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I like the weed at the end,
I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are the kinds of people that
are going to, that are going to push the
[SPEAKER_00]: envelope much more so than like the barely
profitable mega farms or like all these
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are trying to be commercial
commercially viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I hope happens is we develop a weed
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of like the heirloom vegetable
community for a long time, where it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, those guys were like making no
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were trading amongst each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were breeding and growing seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't commercially viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a bunch of hobbyists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could get all kinds of weird
tomatoes and weird squashes and weird this
[SPEAKER_00]: or that that you could not get in the
grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was all because there was this big
diffuse network of breeders and producers
[SPEAKER_00]: and growers that like to do stuff on a
hobbyist level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some really small companies doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually ended up in a whole
foods or it ended up in the co-ops or it
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got repopular, but it wouldn't have
been there had not all those
[SPEAKER_00]: non-commercial enthusiasts had a desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the longer flowering stuff,
that is going to be mostly the purview of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that grow weed because they like to
smoke weed and they're not looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the most efficient, profitable way
to grow some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can afford in my lifestyle to grow this
weird thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like they joke like a boat is
actually just a hole you throw money into.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's lots of people that spend
lots of money on hobbies that don't earn
[SPEAKER_00]: them any money.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a percentage of people, weed is going
to become that hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just going to be like dirt biking
and you need a dirt bike and you need a
[SPEAKER_00]: helmet and you need gear and you need
registration or, you know, you need a
[SPEAKER_00]: boat, you go fishing, you need fishing
poles and lures and tackle boxes and think
[SPEAKER_00]: of any hobby you can think of that dudes
get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are dudes that spend loads of money
on that hobby from, you know, they just
[SPEAKER_00]: skim off their regular life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's my hope is those are the type
of people that are going to be the most
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to keep the weird non-commercial
weed strains alive and being traded and
[SPEAKER_00]: being grown out by breeders, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for people even too, who are
trying to do things the most like
[SPEAKER_03]: efficiently and have all the stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for years I would have, like I was
kind of odd in that I've never I think the
[SPEAKER_03]: first year that I moved into this place,
I grew an all clone crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even though it was an all clone crop,
it was this really weird clone that I had
[SPEAKER_03]: from HP 13 bag seeds from HANA.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this what I call hash plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's this plant that I've kept since
then, since 2008.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 2009, I moved into this place and I
grew a medical and that was, I just had
[SPEAKER_03]: all those, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And other than that, I've always grown
everything from seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like everything is like a hobby
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if I was growing big plants and there
was a lot of weed, it was still off of all
[SPEAKER_03]: these weird odd things that I was making
when I could have been growing Blue Dream
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever and had all this huge amount
of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, but what I, even then, even though
I'd have some sideline stuff, it would
[SPEAKER_03]: still be what was more practical like for
breeding and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to make the new stuff for my big
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after a while, I kind of realized
like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do all this and it still wouldn't
hurt me to have five little pots that have
[SPEAKER_03]: some kind of really weird weed in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So eventually I started being like,
oh, I got to grow some of these Swazis or
[SPEAKER_03]: Lasothos or Congos or Malawis or,
you know, whatever were the cool things
[SPEAKER_03]: that I could get my hands on to go,
all right, here's these weird things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm going to, I'm going to grow
those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so even if you are somebody who's
really trying to really grow, you can
[SPEAKER_03]: still have some little plants off to the
side as its own little thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't take you that much extra effort
and you can have something really weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like here for me, if it's those long
running things, part of it is that like it
[SPEAKER_03]: won't finish here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can't grow it and produce it
because you're going to be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, all my big buds got some mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd have to depth it and this part and
then let it finish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then what I've learned over the years
though, too, is that for a lot of these,
[SPEAKER_03]: like if it's a really weird thing,
like if it's a Congo, just like a nice
[SPEAKER_03]: little bundle of it in a turkey bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what the hell do I need to worry if
some of it gets moldy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's epic to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And gosh, you're making me think back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to, I need to grow some more out
myself for the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually going to have some fans
submitted questions and suggestions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone be sure to message us any
interesting stories, questions,
[SPEAKER_01]: submission ideas might pop up in the next
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll pick some of the most interesting
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that just about brings us to the
end of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the first episode of not in my bag,
a massive, massive shout out to our
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible guest, Mr. Not-so-dog for
joining us today, as well as my usual
[SPEAKER_01]: co-host with the most Mr. Mean Gene of
Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get out of here, any final
words, final thoughts, my friends?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always liked chatting with my buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a real nice convo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was fun, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good one to get it kicked off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Likewise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Likewise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't think of two people I would
rather do it more with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we'll see you all for the next
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys all have a wonderful night.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You too.
Good night.
