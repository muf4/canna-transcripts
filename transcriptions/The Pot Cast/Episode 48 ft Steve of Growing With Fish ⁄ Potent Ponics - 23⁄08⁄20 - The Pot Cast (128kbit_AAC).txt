[SPEAKER_00]: On this episode, we're extremely,
extremely grateful to have Steve from
[SPEAKER_00]: Potent Ponics and the Growing with the
Fishes podcast here to share all his
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge about aquaponics grown in
Africa, IPM, organics, and so,
[SPEAKER_00]: so, so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm doing a disjustice at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado, let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big thank you and welcome to our
friend with the fishes, Steve of Potent
[SPEAKER_00]: Ponics and the Growing with the Fishes
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot for having me, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite awesome to have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had you on a long time ago and you're
one of the more favorite episodes that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have on our audio version.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really awesome to come and hang
out with you and talk with you on your
[SPEAKER_01]: show and learn more about things down
under.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're too kind, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love being able to come on your show and
I certainly learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I'd love to ask you
though, what have you been smoking on
[SPEAKER_00]: recently?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, lately I've been smoking on a lot
of concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing mostly live resin and live
rosin, some Gorilla Glue 4 lately just
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's quite available here in
Southern Oklahoma and then also a little
[SPEAKER_01]: 10th Planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what else?
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a strawberry banana sunset or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think was the other one that we've been
smoking on lately, but I'm more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some digestive tract stuff that
concentrates really help a lot with and as
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who's using it daily for medical
reasons as well as enjoyment, I tend to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a lot better bang for my buck spending
money for concentrates than I do for
[SPEAKER_01]: flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, what a range of awesome different
directions we can go in with that one and
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear about all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the first thing that comes to mind
is Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't hear a lot about the scene out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your take?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oklahoma is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a lot of very opposite ends of
the skills spectrum, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have people that have just found out
about cannabis that maybe have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: acreage and a lot of money that they've
been saved away that are just learning how
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow cannabis for the first time,
maybe don't even know what a photo period
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have all the way to people
coming in from Cali that have everything
[SPEAKER_01]: on a nice system that they just plug and
play and away they go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The price is stabilized at around $2,200 a
pound for quite a long time, plus minus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do have some super cheap stuff coming
in now and then, but the better quality
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff really is holding its price point
more than some of the other newer markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having gone through this in Colorado,
California and a couple of other states,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a couple of other countries now as
well, it really is kind of holding its
[SPEAKER_01]: price point a little higher than some of
the other places, I guess, maybe just
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the demand going up because of
current global events.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it really is kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also one of the lowest regulated
scenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're interested in developing
products, if you're interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: developing methods, if you're interested
in developing stuff that you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: further refine, it's a great place to do
that because $2,500 bucks up until
[SPEAKER_01]: recently was all you needed to get going
and you could have a full vertical
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation and extraction and a retail
space for less than 10 grand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to have all those licenses in a
straight row for that cheap compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone that's tried for a license in
California or some of the other states,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're probably sitting here screaming at
whatever they're listening to this on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent a year and a half trying to get a
license in California and working with the
[SPEAKER_01]: city council and working with everyone
that we needed to to properly go about
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're still denied one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to be able to come out place like
out here and just waltz in and immediately
[SPEAKER_01]: work with someone that's established out
here and get going is quite nice and kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of takes away a lot of the regulatory
hurdles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of interesting to see kind of a
conservative mindset to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there hasn't really been a lot of
other states that have taken that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one thing I said, I mean,
one downside would be that it did take
[SPEAKER_01]: them a little bit longer than some other
states to get universal testing in,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I would have liked to have seen done
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But aside from that, you know,
they are kind of slowly catching up
[SPEAKER_01]: incrementally with some of the other
states in a more sane way, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: than than a lot of other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like there's a lot of
opportunities going on there and a really
[SPEAKER_00]: nice detailed analysis of the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you think that the environment
itself is conducive to growing cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the long term, do you think it'll
kind of rise as a premier sort of state to
[SPEAKER_00]: be producing it in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that it's just the
friendly legalities at the moment or what
[SPEAKER_00]: is allowing it to kind of flourish?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's definitely a small,
I would say maybe 15 to 20 percent of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars that are traditionally going on,
say the West Coast, that'll actually
[SPEAKER_01]: really excel here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of them, having done two summers
now growing stuff out here, the Durban
[SPEAKER_01]: poison, the Malal Malawi and Swazi crosses
and Southern African crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some of the other equatorial
strains seem to be the ones that really,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they're used to the heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're used to the higher humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't really care so much about the
heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they seem to really pack on a few
extra pounds or not a few pounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a few extra grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when you're talking fields
or rooms, a few extra pounds when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing greenhouses or outdoors
specifically, you know, you have really
[SPEAKER_01]: high temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it can get to be one hundred and
seven, one hundred and ten.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is that in Celsius?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that like thirty seven, thirty eight?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so I just came back from Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm still pretty fresh with my
conversions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but, you know, so so you have to have
strains that will tolerate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your your your pure Indicas really do not
like that heat or traditional Indicas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know that the classifications have
changed now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your traditional stuff that,
you know, your purple heavy stuff really
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't do super well out here on the
outdoor stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that's more adapted to cold
climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, again, I'm being very generally
broad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, there's lots of exceptions to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't see a lot of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see a lot more fungal issues that
people aren't used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a huge outbreak of septoria not
only in Oklahoma, but in Tennessee and a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of other states that are doing hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really think a lot of it came from
the lack of biodiversity in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had a huge outbreak of septoria,
Fusarium, Botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was all in these fields that were
corn or soybean or wheat last year that
[SPEAKER_01]: were just completely dead fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no microbiological diversity in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how is this plant going to have any
type of microbe for lack of better or for
[SPEAKER_01]: simplification, a microbial vaccination or
exposure to fungals to know how to make
[SPEAKER_01]: any type of resistance against them?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you have a totally dead
field, it's not going to know what what
[SPEAKER_01]: something is if it comes against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like taking someone that was living
in a bubble and dropping them into Times
[SPEAKER_01]: Square.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, their immune system is not going
to know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same kind of way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that we were able to quickly,
at least in the three farms that I worked
[SPEAKER_01]: with last year with the septoria,
we were able to quickly use a heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial inoculation of both a Bactylus
complex, Bactylus pomilis, Bactylus
[SPEAKER_01]: subtilis, and Lactobacillus making labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer kefir based labs and the
traditional KNF labs, but we can get into
[SPEAKER_01]: that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But and then doing an IMO treatment after
a week of that, of rotating those other
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments and just as a water and a
foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were able to treat almost all those
fields and we only threw out maybe 15
[SPEAKER_01]: plants across those three farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we caught it early.
[SPEAKER_01]: If one septoria gets beyond a certain
point, those plants are boned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's systemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but if you can catch it early,
you can treat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had very good luck by doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it was with microbial
inoculants, not with a spray, not with a
[SPEAKER_01]: fungal, not with sulfur, with proper
probiotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only way to treat some of the
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already looking forward to this chat
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get into it, I definitely
want to chat about Zimbabwe because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: just itch and to be discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to quickly clarify or not
clarify.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to quickly ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that in Oklahoma,
the prices have stabilized at about twenty
[SPEAKER_00]: two hundred a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, what do you predict will be the
kind of long game pricing for a pound?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that is the ballpark of what
you want it to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that it's maybe still a
little high and with more production,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could get it down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you think a good price point is
long term?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, well, I guess the the first
answer I would have is I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody knows the honest answer to that
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will tell you what I think is that I
think that you're going to have craft
[SPEAKER_01]: growers that are going to have and that
are going to stamp out a brand for
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves that for high quality and
they're going to hold their higher price.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see people like Dragonfly Earth
Medicine and the wonderful group of people
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Dempire network that they've built
up and all those wonderful farmers that
[SPEAKER_01]: work so hard to grow clean medicine and
they're able to hold their brand and hold
[SPEAKER_01]: their prices up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think following similar type things,
you have other similar type groups out
[SPEAKER_01]: there that have these different standards
for their product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's going to be a way for
people to really separate themselves from
[SPEAKER_01]: the pack and and allow craft growers to
really excel when you have a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger producers and especially later on
when you have other countries,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you have nations like Colombia,
and Zimbabwe and places that can grow for
[SPEAKER_01]: much cheaper prices than the United States
could ever grow for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're still going to have
absolutely be able to compete right there
[SPEAKER_01]: at a really great price point and probably
around that fifteen hundred, two thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars, maybe even higher price point per
pound for that really craft cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the inputs are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't, you're not going to get
that cheap pound that's hand trimmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's just certain things that just
has a cost to it for the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same way with fine wine or any
fine food, you pay for that higher
[SPEAKER_01]: quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really think that that's going to be
you're going to have your craft growers
[SPEAKER_01]: that really separate themselves pretty
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to have the kind of
just general production for everything
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to get a little more into
the nitty gritty of that, because I've had
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people message me over the past
year or so and they call me the nitty
gritty.
And they're like, you know, I'm a nitty
gritty.
I'm a nitty gritty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they kind of reference this idea you
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, I would love to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering what are some ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing I would always reply with is
I always think that if you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: set yourself apart, one easy way to do it
is to get like a strain and find your own
[SPEAKER_00]: unique keeper of it, ideally something
that's not already in circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you even breed it yourself,
which that's, you know, a bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: different discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are some of the ways you think
people can build a brand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I thought like unique strain,
maybe, you know, even unique cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: style aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can people help to establish
themselves as a unique producer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would say definitely look at
unique products.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have the ability or if you have a
recipe for something that grandma made
[SPEAKER_01]: that was super awesome, make an infused
version if it's something that's allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: in your state, you know, and these types
of things where you already have something
[SPEAKER_01]: unique, you just didn't think of using it
in the cannabis realm or some of that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but in particular, one way that I work
with a lot of companies is with
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, as a group right now,
I'm working with on a license application
[SPEAKER_01]: in Chicago, where we're going to be
donating 100% of our fish to the local
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our cannabis facility is providing free
food for the local community on top of all
[SPEAKER_01]: the medicine we're providing for the
patients within the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're able to feed people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also will set up with a lot of these
aquaponics systems, we'll set up wicking
[SPEAKER_01]: beds on the outside because we do have to,
you know, we can discharge a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: from our filtration system if we're
brewing and we make extra and we need some
[SPEAKER_01]: place to put it without having to pay for
disposal in places like California,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can set up wicking beds and just have a
public garden out front and grow
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables for our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, being more than just a cannabis
company, but being a pillar of the
[SPEAKER_01]: community that's giving back to the
community and, you know, using the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: converting greed into good and really
bringing the whole message and the energy
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, think about everyone listening to
this show, how many times has funds that
[SPEAKER_01]: started with cannabis ended up creating
and helping someone that you knew in a
[SPEAKER_01]: hard spot or with car parts or with rent
or with whatever all of us did at some
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone that's in the cannabis industry
started slinging eights or slinging grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we're in this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's very few people that didn't get
into it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if they did, they got into it late.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you got into it, pre-legalization,
that's what you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of us got started that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got into growing and then we
got into, you know, more and more and
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is really a way where we can give
back to our community and do it as a
[SPEAKER_01]: byproduct.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, those fish are providing
fertilizer for us and we're able to just
[SPEAKER_01]: give them back to the community as a way
to feed people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, that helps us with our story,
helps us with our brand, helps us with our
[SPEAKER_01]: whole eco, not only eco responsible,
but community responsible with our
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a powerful message because I even had
a question about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might even jump to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whenever I discussed aquaponics with,
I've got a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me clarify.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the guy I'm trying to think of,
the real big aquaponics guy in Queensland
[SPEAKER_00]: in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Murray Hallam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Murray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a good friend who has trained
under him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's quite knowledgeable and,
you know, firsthand knowledge from Murray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said he's interested in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that he always kind of
struggled to see a big cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: facility doing aquaponics purely for the
sense that he was like, it just seems
[SPEAKER_00]: weird to have a store that sells fish and
cannabis because he's like, that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: the end goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you got fish and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to sell them both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you've just provided a really nice
alternative pathway to use those fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that idea, though,
that they raised is a legitimate sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: concern about like you've just got that
you're ending up with these two different
[SPEAKER_00]: products, or do you think we just need to
look deeper like what you mentioned as to
[SPEAKER_00]: how we can utilize the resources?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's kind of two pieces to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off, one of the other things that
I've talked about with California
[SPEAKER_01]: producers is doing a cannabis infused
smoke fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taking taking the fish, doing fillets
and then doing a cannabis glaze,
[SPEAKER_01]: a flavored glaze, and then smoking it and
then doing it, selling that as a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could actually have a very good,
you know, value added item with the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and have the cannabis be the
value added rather than, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so depending on how you want to go with
your business model, you could also raise
[SPEAKER_01]: tropical fish and flip those as well for
profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that often can be much more profitable
than raising food fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, in almost all cases is more
profitable than raising food fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're strictly focused on profits
as a cannabis company, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: avoiding food fish altogether.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the other component, and this is only
an issue in the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: is you cannot get a meat processing
license, which you need to have to kill
[SPEAKER_01]: the fish and clean the fish, and a
cannabis license, because cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: still federally regulated as a schedule
one drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the meat processing facilities are all
in
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have this issue where I have to
license a third party processor that's
[SPEAKER_01]: already licensed, where they come pick up
the fish or I deliver the fish either live
[SPEAKER_01]: or frozen, whole frozen on ice,
and then have them clean them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, third party and to legally
resell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that is a regulatory issue that is
currently an issue in the United States
[SPEAKER_01]: because because of the current federal law
that people it's kind of a weird thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm sure no politician thought about
as a weird buy, you know, it's an off
[SPEAKER_01]: weird thing, but it is a legal hurdle for
occupant cannabis facilities currently in
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in Kentucky, I actually helped the
guys over at one of the universities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they got the thing,
but I helped write a grant for I believe
[SPEAKER_01]: it was Langston University, if memory
recalls last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, help them write a grant for a
truck, a processing truck so that they'd
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to go around to the different
occupant cannabis companies in Oklahoma,
[SPEAKER_01]: because Oklahoma currently has the most
number of occupant cannabis licenses of
[SPEAKER_01]: any state in the United States right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of number of businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's quite a few different companies
that have adapted a couple both existing
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities and then, you know,
new built from scratch facilities in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Tulsa and Oklahoma area, as well as
Oklahoma City area, as well as further
[SPEAKER_01]: south where I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all all doing cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, kind of lost my train of thought
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's just a trail of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to leave some cookie crumbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the question it raises for me
is you just paint such a beautiful picture
[SPEAKER_00]: with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you anticipate that as the years go by,
we're going to see an increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: aquaponic cultivation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that it's just one of
those things where, you know, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: always going to have the people who want
to do the rock wall and you're just never
[SPEAKER_00]: going to change their mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, I think you're always going to
have people that have their set system
[SPEAKER_01]: that works for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hey, if someone has a system that
works for them and they're crushing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: why change it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't, I'm not going to,
you know, if you have, if you just kill it
[SPEAKER_01]: with soil or you kill it with hydro,
you kill it with cocoa, like rock it,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think that, and having done lots
of side by sides now, and then consulted
[SPEAKER_01]: for lots of companies that paid me to do
side by sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can crush that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry about the pupper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a younger pupper that all puppers
are welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with aquaponics, we've managed to get
significantly higher terpenes than all of
[SPEAKER_01]: our hydro or soil controls across the
board.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had not a single test out of over
120 ever come back lower on the terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to dual root zone aquaponic
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even non-dual root zone aquaponic controls
will, about 75% of the time will be almost
[SPEAKER_01]: all, but the best living soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just through terpene and
cannabinoid testing that we've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what we attribute it to is one of two
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either there's an endophyte, you know,
certain endophytes that are colonizing the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant from the aquatic microbiome,
or the stimulation of having both the
[SPEAKER_01]: terrestrial and aquatic microbiomes or
combination thereof of both what I just
[SPEAKER_01]: said, and this of having those two
microbiomes, the terrestrial microbiome in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil area on the upper half of the
root zone and the aquatic layer in the
[SPEAKER_01]: lower half of the root zone with dual root
zone pots allows you to have, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: such an increase in biodiversity that,
you know, you get that increase in
[SPEAKER_01]: stimulation to the plant's immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what does a plant do when it needs to
defend itself and gets a plant's immune
[SPEAKER_01]: system stimulated increases terpenes and
depending on what the stimuli it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by increasing the number of
non-pathogenic microbes to the root
[SPEAKER_01]: system, you can basically give it more
vaccinations for, you know, a simplified
[SPEAKER_01]: way of thinking about it and increase the
total terpene production by giving an
[SPEAKER_01]: exposure to more microbes in a way that
that's not going to screw with it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: negative way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that really allows us to give us
a huge advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other big advantages that we have is
we use around 18% with my methodology of
[SPEAKER_01]: water compared to many other soil grown
methods, you know, a drain to waste or
[SPEAKER_01]: most of your soil outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just gallons per day per plant
under a four month growth, three to three
[SPEAKER_01]: and a half to four month growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So assuming you have a minor veg and then
a quick flip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we've had really,
really great luck with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also increased acceleration of
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in veg, we have no problem hitting the
two to four inch a day mark all day long
[SPEAKER_01]: with aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even we don't even have to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just incredible how fast and anyone
can go onto my YouTube and see for
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves time stamped videos of
different farms of multiple farms on there
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can see, you know, incredible
acceleration of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the the farm I was just working with
here in southern Oklahoma, we were
[SPEAKER_01]: averaging two to four inches of growth per
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we were able to shave on flower
anywhere from five to 14 days off the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering cycle by increasing the speed of
that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in terms of speed of growth,
again, we attribute that to increase the
[SPEAKER_01]: gas exchange in the root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really does make a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many things we got to talk about in
terms of speed of growth.
I mean, you know, we've got a lot of
different ways to do that.
So we've got a lot of different ways to do
that.
We've got a lot of different ways to do
that.
We've got a lot of different ways to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to quickly jump back because
I'm a really big fan of when you were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about the plant's immune system
and the increased terpenes to assist with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts around the use of
chitin based products as I mean to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are you still able to utilize those in
aquaponics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, you asked a really awesome
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually just did a trial of three
different chitinase based treatments for
[SPEAKER_01]: insect control when I was over in
Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did a liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you familiar with IMO or indigenous
microorganisms from Korean natural
[SPEAKER_01]: farming?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're familiar with that,
what we do is we did one method where we
[SPEAKER_01]: took that and did 30 percent insect frass
and then 60 percent or 70 percent rice and
[SPEAKER_01]: then mixed that together, cooked it and
then did that as an IMO treatment for
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we were able to collect chitinase
feeding microbes that would feed on the
[SPEAKER_01]: exoskeletons or the insects, not the
plants, to defend the plants from mainly
[SPEAKER_01]: the biggest issue we were dealing with is
these large African grasshoppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they were locusts, but they were
huge and they were the biggest problem we
[SPEAKER_01]: had because they chew the bark off the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the biggest issue is they
chew the Cambrian layer off the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the biggest problem we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the large grasshoppers would chew the
Cambrian Cambrian layer off the plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: then the plants would basically the top
anything above that would start to die
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started spraying with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was by far the best treatment
that we had for any of the things that we
[SPEAKER_01]: had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were able to kill the grasshoppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a couple of days to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once we were sprayed the plants and
sprayed the ground and we were doing that
[SPEAKER_01]: once a week, it worked incredibly well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just made a liquid IMO from from
that the same way that you would make
[SPEAKER_01]: liquid IMO from an IMO one and you get IMO
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also tried where we did the
normal IMO collection and then introduced
[SPEAKER_01]: insect frass at the point of IMO three
rather than at the point of IMO one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found that while it did work,
it did not work anywhere near as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The efficacy wasn't anywhere near as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other one we did is we did it
with IMO four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, that was very similar to IMO
three.
[SPEAKER_01]: While it did work, it didn't work as well
as doing it at the IMO one stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, and then again, now you have
a bunch of free chitinase that's available
[SPEAKER_01]: for the plants to absorb via the roots or
any other way that it wants to because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just melting insects in your field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was one of the best general
insect sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to use that as one of our
mainstays for insect control over in
[SPEAKER_01]: Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's probably about time we jump
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for anyone who hasn't quite picked up
on it, you did a stint in Africa just
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you be able to give us a rundown on
I guess how the opportunity just at least
[SPEAKER_00]: initially presented itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been working with a couple of
different groups out of Canada for off and
[SPEAKER_01]: on for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the groups I'd worked with
previously had someone that was working
[SPEAKER_01]: with a different group over in Europe and
Africa and started talking to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they kind of needed someone that knew
the ropes on the cannabis side of things
[SPEAKER_01]: to go over there and kind of train people
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ended up getting together with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Took a little bit longer to get the
funding together, mostly because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: FDA rules that came in place back in
October.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was October 27th when the sky fell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So or whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then anyways, ended up over in Africa
and in December.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so I was over in Zimbabwe or ended up
over in Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're getting everything going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had 750 acres that we were prepping.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had about 15 acres that we had planted
and ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the virus hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had about 72 hours to get out
of the country if I was going to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, so that was that was my sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully when this all settles down
next year, probably I'll think,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now they harvested off what was
there and everything's on pause because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's it's psychotic to try and move
any products around the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: The world right now and trying to move
cannabis is even harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just kind of a process at all and
sit on it for now, because financially
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the only thing that makes sense on
the scale that we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I totally get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, we're going to probably dig
around this topic for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to go back for a minute,
you mentioned that things are on pause at
[SPEAKER_00]: the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually know a guy who's involved in
general hydroponic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many years ago, he was contracted to
go to Zimbabwe, I think, just to grow some
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he set the operation up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like kind of a similar situation
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He felt confident he'd trained them up
well enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he left and it was all going well
for probably six, 12 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after a while, it just started
going really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was getting emails about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's just like, oh, I don't know
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But apparently it's starting to go really
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it ended up happening was that
the locals were just so kind of unfamiliar
[SPEAKER_00]: with he was using salt based nutrients in
a pure hydroponic setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically what had happened was they
were using like a part A and B nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the A or the B had run out and
they just didn't understand how it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were like, oh, we just use the
A in replacement if we don't have any B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just kind of highlighted that like
it was such a foreign style of growing
[SPEAKER_00]: that they just they didn't fully
understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like that might be the case
now that if you like that might be why
[SPEAKER_00]: things are on pause?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is still a bit of a learning
gap for them to fully get autonomous with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, the reason why everything is on
pause is because they're the value of
[SPEAKER_01]: their dollar is collapsed because of the
virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so that's that's honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as agricultural stuff,
they are incredibly learned with
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural practices, especially organic
agricultural practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are very good about doing a lot of
stuff that we would consider similar to
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they also have a huge presence of
Syngenta.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go into Monsanto, as you guys may
also know them as for the you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they that's their other name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go into Harare or any of the
bigger areas, Kadoma or Vic Falls or
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere, you're going to see Syngenta,
Syngenta, Syngenta.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they sell all they probably sell 85 to
90 percent of the seed in the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: country, which sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's probably the biggest issue is
that it's hard to find and it's hard for
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers to find good seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the moment you get away from any of
the big cities, it's all organic as can
[SPEAKER_01]: be.
[SPEAKER_01]: They they they they don't they've never
seen a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know what a pesticide is like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a matter or they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're making ferments and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like or artes or they're they're
burning something, you know, a smelly herb
[SPEAKER_01]: to have the smoke waft through to get them
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they have some other method.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say and it's funny because I had
this conversation with somebody else
[SPEAKER_01]: Zimbabwe actually this week just because
of the current events in the United States
[SPEAKER_01]: is that I said, you know, if something
were to happen with the government in
[SPEAKER_01]: Zimbabwe, everyone can just kind of farm
like everyone knows how to farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone knows how to self sustain
themselves from a survival standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas in the United States, people
don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, large percentage of the United
States doesn't even know how to plant a
[SPEAKER_01]: seed and grow a bean or a tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just not something that
people are familiar with or been exposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whereas, you know, a lot of these other
parts of the world, yeah, maybe they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have all the things that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone there can feed themselves if they
have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, they all have a garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single person has a garden on their
property where they're growing food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it's culturally,
you know, a lot different where they are
[SPEAKER_01]: more so sustaining in terms of food
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if I was going to get
stranded and something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have more food in a place
like that, even though it sounds kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that probably a question a lot
of a lot of our listeners are wondering is
[SPEAKER_00]: whereabouts in Zimbabwe were you based
geographically and what type of strains
[SPEAKER_00]: did you found work really well there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were growing a couple of different
CBD cultivars in Kadoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually don't have the strain list in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I posted it up on my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the exact strains that we were
growing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were actually the first company to
legally import them into Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, funny story on that,
which I'm sure the the guys at the airport
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want me to tell you, but I'll tell
you anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get these seeds in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like a big giant pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you can smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're fresh seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they smell like terpenes like you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like a fat old bag of wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they open it up and the cops like,
whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're like, can you do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they want to see paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they held it for a couple of
extra days and checked with the Ministry
[SPEAKER_01]: of Health and also other crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so we finally get it cleared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so they have like the like the
NARC cops or like the drug cops there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're laughing about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's test the dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they go and they grab the dogs and they
bring the they put three packages out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ours is one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the dogs completely ignore it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they get real mad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just sitting there laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we realize, like, they're getting
really they're getting more mad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just kind of like, can we get the
paper?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we get paperwork and get out of here
now?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not push the limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, in terms of Zimbabwe,
were you more up north, more down south,
[SPEAKER_00]: or do you feel like the whole area is just
pristine?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter where you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was I spent so I did go out and visit
in Yanga, which is in the Far East over by
[SPEAKER_01]: Mozambique.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I also worked the farms where I
was working in was one is in Morendera and
[SPEAKER_01]: the other one was in north of Kadoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to give the exact location
just for security reasons, but north of
[SPEAKER_01]: Kadoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's probably the biggest large city
nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like Zimbabwe in particular
has a really nice sort of environment
[SPEAKER_00]: that's conducive to growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that the end game is that
like most African countries will just be
[SPEAKER_00]: set to go hard?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think Zimbabwe particularly has a
wonderful climate temperature wise and
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity wise and everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the soil is very conducive for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, when you're there,
did you try to grow anything in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: or was it all aquaponic?
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the two farms I worked with was
aquaponics and the other one was soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what would be your recommendations for
someone looking to work with some soil
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got that's never been like tended
to, so to speak, and they're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: to maybe put some inputs in?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your go to inputs that you might
put into the soil to help give it some
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, oh, man, it's really going to depend
on what that soil is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's a lot of not a lot of
organics in it, I would say, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: making sure you can add a compost or some,
you know, leaf mulch or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, it's really just going to
depend on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my first thing would be get a
soil test and find out what's going on in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and, you know, get some under a
microscope slide so that you can see what
[SPEAKER_01]: the heck is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess maybe one of the more commonly
heard claims I hear is that basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is it, biochar and cover crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always hear those two things because
it's like it makes sense in theory,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like that actually works in
practicality?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've done a lot of testing with
biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be an outlier and tell you,
I think it's in 75 to 90% of people's
[SPEAKER_01]: farms complete snake oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it'll do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing good composting,
good microbial inoculation, your KNF
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs, you are going to notice absolutely
zero difference in yield, terpene content,
[SPEAKER_01]: or cannabinoid content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say this because there's a farm in
Gilcrest, Colorado that I've worked with
[SPEAKER_01]: that we put together in 2013 or 2000,
2013, and couldn't remember it was 13 or
[SPEAKER_01]: 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they have six acres of hemp there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's half acre of zero control,
half acre of 1% biochar, half acre of
[SPEAKER_01]: control, half acre of 3% biochar,
half acre control, half acre of 5% biochar
[SPEAKER_01]: and a full acre control that we were doing
some other testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In all those years, we've had no
difference in yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only difference we've noticed is the
size of the cover crop is larger on where
[SPEAKER_01]: the higher amount of biochar is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could say that there's more
microbial biodiversity in the surface of
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strictly speaking for CBD hemp,
it has made no visible financial yields
[SPEAKER_01]: growing at a half acre scale over all
those years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I can say that based on numerics
and financials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So based on that, then yes, I think it's
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you have a super compact clay or
you have just really terrible soil or no
[SPEAKER_01]: organics at all, yeah, it's going to do
wonders for your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're dosing with all your normal
probiotics and your KNF inputs and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else, you're already adding all
the microbials and a lot of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need an extra space for it to
survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not really adding something
that's not already being colonized.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're inoculating on top of, you're just
adding a space for the inoculant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're already adding the
inoculant, it's kind of a redundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as a sort of a random curiosity
for myself, do you feel like the microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity there is plentiful enough that
you don't need to supplement with any sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of microbial product that would might be
like more external or even something like
[SPEAKER_00]: say a mycorrhizae?
[SPEAKER_01]: It really depends on what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer to still do some external
inoculants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found in aquaponics, just in terms of
products, mammoth pea has probably been
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the biggest in terms of amount of
testable in PPMs available of a nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: from any microbial I've ever tested with
aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the one that has increased any
nutrient by the largest amount by not
[SPEAKER_01]: adding any additional salt, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So by not adding any physical phosphorus,
just by adding the microbe, it is
[SPEAKER_01]: increased phosphorus on average around 30
to 35% in aquaponics systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can get that established and get
those microbes in your system,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a great inoculant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I often recommend that and recharge from
real growers over at the guys that do
[SPEAKER_01]: do-grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We often recommend both of those for
people inoculating their new aquaponics
[SPEAKER_01]: systems to get those Bactylus species as
nitrifying bacteria, those initial
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal protectants, you know,
something that's going to get in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: outcompete pythium and root rot and a lot
of the other issues you have with aquatic
[SPEAKER_01]: based systems, be it aquaponics or
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a, what a powerful testament to the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we get into the nit gritty of the
aquaponics itself, what sort of things are
[SPEAKER_00]: you feeding the fish and supplementing the
system with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you still have to use any?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think I remember I spoke with you
maybe a while ago and you mentioned that
[SPEAKER_00]: like iron can sometimes be hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might need to supplement with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you found workarounds for those
things or it's still like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's certain principles that still
apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, regardless of what you're doing
with aquaponics, you know, fish waste is
[SPEAKER_01]: not microbially or not microbially
chemically designed to grow plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was never part of the plan with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, fish waste does not provide
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will provide the vast majority.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can get anywhere, depending on
cultivar 80 to 90% of the nutrients that
[SPEAKER_01]: we need for feeding, uh, you know,
for almost any cannabis cultivar,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, is going to fall into that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the base nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we will need to supplement potassium,
calcium, uh, iron, and some micronutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, certain cultivars will really plow
through molybdenum and zinc and a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of your micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other ones don't, it seems to be more
predominantly on the ones that are more
[SPEAKER_01]: colorful, your purples and your oranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they seem to, especially molybdenum,
they plow through it because they need it
[SPEAKER_01]: for the endocyanin production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, uh, and anyone that doesn't know
if you're having problems with your
[SPEAKER_01]: purples, not being purple, add some
molybdenum, uh, sodium, molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, at a, like a 0.1 part per million
dosage, it'll, it'll immediately turn your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants purple if they have the genetics
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, again, it has to do it and you got to
trigger the gene, but, uh, plants will
[SPEAKER_01]: also create extra anthocyanin to bind up a
mild molybdenum toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can actually force the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it has it to produce extra anthocyanin
via forced mild quote, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, mild molybdenum toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you go too hard, you're going to cause
other problems with your nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: but.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's a whole separate
discussion, but, uh, um, but for purples,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, and silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've done a ton of side-by-side testing
with silica and we did silica testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and what actually, uh, we'll start off
with the beginning of why we started
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at silica with aquaponics was,
uh, specifically was, uh, there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: gentleman, I can't remember his name at a
boulder.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I used to work at the aquaponics
source, I used to work and help.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used, we had a whole plant team and a
product team and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had different things that we worked
on and developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the plant team was trying to figure
out why our aquaponic tomatoes always
[SPEAKER_01]: tasted slightly different than the,
than the hydroponic or soil tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went and had them tissue sampled and
sure enough, it was silica and chloride
[SPEAKER_01]: were the two things that were missing,
which was very strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and this was before we learned about
flavonoid testing and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were looking at this more from a
nutrient kind of perspective before,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, anyways, uh, I was a little
bit greener on the, trying to fine tune
[SPEAKER_01]: this on the, on the plant side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't thinking cannabis mindset with
the vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so anyways, so, so, um, the issue,
uh, so what we did was we tested that and
[SPEAKER_01]: noticed the silica and the chloride.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did was we upped the silica,
we upped the chloride and we had a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: increase in, uh, not only yield above
about 15 to 20%, but we also had a reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: in production and powdery mildew and
molds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also had a reduction in,
um, we also had a reduction in,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, issues with, um, uh, uh, crispness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we harvested lettuce and put it in
the fridge, we were able to get anywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: from five to eight additional days in the
fridge where it's, you know, before it
[SPEAKER_01]: started to wilt and look like crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we were also, you know,
and other things like powdery mildew and
[SPEAKER_01]: cucumbers and, and, um, uh, the,
uh, total, um, um, failure rate of flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: on cucumbers were also increased by
increasing silica as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to be a threshold around,
um, uh, 60 parts per million in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in aquaponics, uh, really seems to be that
minimum threshold, at least for most
[SPEAKER_01]: crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then cannabis seems to be a little bit
higher than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, but in general, that's some of
the different rabbit holes that I've had
[SPEAKER_01]: the pleasure of jumping down with some of
the different groups that I've worked
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very detailed analysis of what's
necessary there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A question I've always been wondering is,
do you think that even with the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: aquaponics, if you're in somewhere like
Zimbabwe, you could still get some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir or do you think it just,
it probably has to be in the ground to
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so I do think, and I, and I,
so I'm two minds in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one, you're not, I wouldn't qualify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't go in with an aquaponics system
into humble and say, it's a humble
[SPEAKER_01]: terroir, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's, it's not going to have the
microbes and the flavors from the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would say is that you could make a
good argument that aquaponics is its own
[SPEAKER_01]: terroir because it is its own root biome
that is completely unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you will have unique to different
climates and you could say maybe,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you could do certain things and
you could absolutely develop something
[SPEAKER_01]: similar because again, you're,
you're microbial biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funny, you mentioned that NASA
did a study a couple of years ago and I
[SPEAKER_01]: was working with a vegetable farm that
participated in this and they did DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: studies on trying to see, okay,
well what are all the mineralizing
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we went to Mars or someplace like that,
what's the pack of microbes we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring to aquatically mineralize either
human waste or animal waste or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to do for fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so whatever, you know, biological
waste that we're going to process into
[SPEAKER_01]: plant food, what packet of microbes do we
need?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they tested all manner of soil microbes
and aquatic microbes and they had some
[SPEAKER_01]: cool results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things they found was,
is that the, the most or the least
[SPEAKER_01]: biodiverse aquaponics system was 168% more
biodiverse than the most biodiverse soil
[SPEAKER_01]: system they test in terms of microbial
species count.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they, they, the aquatic biome just
slaughtered it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you think about it, the aquatic
microbiome has had an extra billion years
[SPEAKER_01]: to evolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course that makes sense,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That that's a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also they found that,
you know, none of the aquatic tests had
[SPEAKER_01]: the same microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had radically different chains of
microbes that were mineralizing the same
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals and completely different chains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them were two, some of them were
up to eight and everything in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and each, each one of them was
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no universal and that was,
I think one of the even trippier things is
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have all these different ways
that this is co-evolved around the planet
[SPEAKER_01]: to mineralize XYZ minerals a thousand
different times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who knows, you know, it's such a big
rabbit hole and no one's looking at it for
[SPEAKER_01]: aquatic mineralization.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there's billions of dollars in ag
tech sitting there on the table and no
[SPEAKER_01]: one's even looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's really a huge, if someone
out there's listening to this and wants a
[SPEAKER_01]: gold mine, there you go, you know,
pick, pick, pick literally any microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 78% of them will live in a terrestrial
microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 78% of those microbes that you can hunt
for will live in both soil and aquatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's an area that needs a ton of
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs lots of university students doing
lots of papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs all of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's almost like a gold mine of papers
you could put out on that subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I then start to think what would
be in your mind, the most optimal end goal
[SPEAKER_00]: for these producers in Africa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that it's going to get
probably turned to oil or do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: that the flour could become of good enough
quality that it gets imported into more
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of expensive Western sort of
countries as a generalization or what do
[SPEAKER_00]: you think is the ideal end goal for these
African countries such as Zimbabwe?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think really their bulk goal is to do
bulk isolate production, doing oils that
[SPEAKER_01]: are separated out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not, again, they're not going to
compete for quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can compete for scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cost of labor there is very cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your average person there makes eight to
$12,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them are closer to eight or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to give you an idea of people in
Zimbabwe in terms of US money per year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's middle class.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do the math on how cheap some of these
people are living per year or per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that neither you or I are
capable of doing, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But definitely something where I think
that you're going to have these low labor
[SPEAKER_01]: costs are going to end up being a player
in the market long term.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to do when someone can
bring over shipping containers and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that's being produced for $18 a pound or
$12 a pound?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're competing, what they will do is
drive out the Aurora, drive out the
[SPEAKER_01]: Canopy, drive out the Budweiser,
drive out the Marlboro and the Philip
[SPEAKER_01]: Morris.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll drive all those guys out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the craft growers that listen to
the show, they're not competing with them
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not even on the same league.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've actually heard of some other
people who've done some stuff down in
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like most notably, Gene Finder has done
some stuff and I'd even heard some rumors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it might've even been put out by
of all people, Chimera, that the Philip
[SPEAKER_00]: Morrisons are interested in looking into
Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you see any other people or other
operations down there looking to do
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually I guess what I would say is
the most concerning is there's a Chinese
[SPEAKER_01]: group that's kind of moving into Africa
that wants to kind of push into the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis market and they're trying really
hard to find genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were desperately trying to talk to
anyone Westerner for genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to desperately buy anything
that I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seemed to be the thing that they
didn't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are setting up some big
operations over there and who knows what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to do to the price points in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They already have completely collapsed the
fiber market and the oil market price
[SPEAKER_01]: point wise to make it really hard to
compete.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's hope that they don't try to move
in on the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, they're still never going to
compete with the craft growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that are buying high quality
stuff right now are not going to ever look
[SPEAKER_01]: at that anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess my next question,
although for you, it would be specific to
[SPEAKER_00]: Zimbabwe, but I think you could broadly
apply it to anyone who's going to a kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of an area where like there is cheaper
labor and they're looking to set up a
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think in that sort of general
situation, you would look to bring in some
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics like what you just mentioned,
or do you think that it might be more wise
[SPEAKER_00]: to work with any pre-existing cultivars
that might be there?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually, well, I have access and
have some wonderful Zimbabwean cultivars I
[SPEAKER_01]: picked up in Nyanga, but they are not
heavy yielders.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not commercially viable stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing on a commercial scale,
and if I'm growing and setting up for
[SPEAKER_01]: someone as a consulting client,
I'm setting it up as a resin factory and
[SPEAKER_01]: it needs to pump resin out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care about anything other than
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to pump flour and pump resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to turn over quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be resistant to most things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to not be a pain in my ass to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs not to have some whack ass
feeding schedule that's going to make me
[SPEAKER_01]: pull my hair out or some other baby thing
that that particular strain is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: annoy the crap out of me about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone has a strain they love,
but it does this XYZ weird thing if you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So try to avoid all that stuff and just
get to something that's easy, consistent,
[SPEAKER_01]: that people that aren't on the same skill
level as me can pump out and run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't matter what I can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It matters what the guys I train that
leave behind can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing I think that a lot of
people set themselves up for is that
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody that's high skill level can come
into anywhere and crush it and get the
[SPEAKER_01]: place back online.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's can you train the guys and then leave
them with a coloring book, simple
[SPEAKER_01]: methodology that they can follow after
that that they can succeed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really, I think, an area where
it's hard to because there isn't a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural education in Africa in local
languages.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, there's almost nothing in
agriculture stuff in Shona.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is the native language in Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to find even plant names
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was trying to research plant names
and pathogens and pests, it was hard for
[SPEAKER_01]: me to look up that in Shona or English.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's just nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just it's all verbal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of African stuff is just
verbal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't there's not a lot of
documentation or there isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the language isn't there for that
type of long term documentation,
[SPEAKER_01]: for lack of a better word, with with the
languages for our specific craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just hasn't been developed yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no word for terpene or
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just you see I'm saying it's almost
like with with like the people that I
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it Oregon PDX?
[SPEAKER_01]: Blanking out on her name right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jared and Angela Pranks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're working on the sign language for
the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have the language for our
industry in the African languages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some conversations are hard to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trying to explain things on a basic
level when they don't even understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if they understand English,
I just went over their head.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, and then also just
trying to make sure that like when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to find seeds or if you are trying
to acquire anything, that like it can be
[SPEAKER_01]: quite the quite the hectic thing to do and
quite the long journey to get to the farm
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, you might have to,
I don't know, jump on one leg and rub your
[SPEAKER_01]: belly to get them to believe that you're
not a cop and all kinds of other goofy
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally, when you have waist length
dreads, it gets you by most of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you bring up a very valid point,
you know, like we both need to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: same lexicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, we can't really talk,
can we?
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to jump back to one of the
previous points, if you're willing to,
[SPEAKER_00]: what sort of genetics did you take with
you that you thought would do well there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And long term, do you think that down the
track, people will breed stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically for that area?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so the stuff that I specifically
brought was Durban.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I brought some Reunion Island
seeds, which the old Zamo mall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because they're damn near there,
it's very close latitude wise to where we
[SPEAKER_01]: were.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not far off a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured, hey, if it's going to work
and get me that that that weird gene
[SPEAKER_01]: expression with the continuous flower,
I need to grow it, you know, at that same,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, as close to that latitude as I
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hey, if I'm going to be in Zimbabwe,
hey, let's go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and then what was the other one?
[SPEAKER_01]: G13 Hash Plant from Dragonfly Earth
Medicine was the other one that found its
[SPEAKER_01]: way over there, allegedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the other one that was the THC
cultivars that we brought over.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some other stuff that, again,
I have it written down on the post.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember what the other stuff was,
but those are the ones that I brought over
[SPEAKER_01]: personally for my own smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, to me, the first two you
mentioned, the Durban and the Zamo,
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds like pretty clear winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can understand why it's going to work
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am curious to know, did the G13 Hash
Plant just freak out or you handled it
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty reasonably well, considering?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them did great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and I specifically I knew it was a
pretty it's a pretty sativa leaning plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and it I just it's my favorite thing to
smoke all day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm going to smoke one plant all the
rest of my days, ever since last April
[SPEAKER_01]: when I was first introduced to that
cultivar, it's got its claws into me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's thanks, Josh and Kelly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've been lucky enough to try some
of that same cut and yeah, very special
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question, I guess I was
interested in is that we're hearing a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of talk these days about how there's kind
of this detrimental I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: detrimental is the right word,
but people comment about how we see a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of hemp sprayed with distillers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It and it's getting passed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's that is a bit of a
risk with the massive influx of cheap
[SPEAKER_00]: distillate coming into the market long
term?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that's more of just like a
short term thing and people will catch out
[SPEAKER_00]: how like, you know, they'll learn to pick
up on it and just stop buying it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, I think it's definitely a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'll definitely become a problem,
especially international stuff where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot easier to hide it on bigger batches.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, shit, I I can remember a lot
of years and years ago seeing people
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying garbage weed with terpenes in
California, you know, as soon as they were
[SPEAKER_01]: as soon as a river was a blue river.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue River Terpene?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it came out with Blue Dream.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as they came out with those
terpene vials, man, it was all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like like that's one as soon as people
started doing the isolated terps and
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can remember seeing I know I was where I
went and had a guy I was consulting for in
[SPEAKER_01]: San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he comes up to me with this bag of
white moldy, like very clearly PM covered
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He thought it was awesome because he
thought it was frosty and he had never
[SPEAKER_01]: seen PM before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was sprayed with terps to hide the
the boy high school locker room smell.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he dude, we I about fell out of my
chair laughing because this dude had paid
[SPEAKER_01]: like three grand or some shit for some
moldy ass weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real risk factor, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it brings us on to the more
valid question, which is what do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: will be kind of the next step with
distillates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you what sort of products do you
think will be utilizing this more cheaper
[SPEAKER_00]: distillate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think pens is going to be just,
you know, it's just full steam ahead or
[SPEAKER_00]: where do you see things going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the pen market is rapidly changing
because you have all the one we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the pen market is interesting
because you have terpenes that are highly
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated in Europe in an isolated form
that are not regulated in a blended
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis form, which at some point is
going to have to have some type of legal
[SPEAKER_01]: reckoning and at least in the EU market
and probably probably on the wider
[SPEAKER_01]: international market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have, you know, pens are
popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you have the coils that
depending on quality can be a health
[SPEAKER_01]: hazard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have, you know, depending on the blend
with the terpenes can again be a health
[SPEAKER_01]: hazard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but people love them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pens are one of the most popular
things out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Edibles are also super popular and cooking
oil is super popular here in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those three are are about 65 percent of
the market because it's a lot of older
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to be able to dose themselves
and they want something that's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more discreet and not, you know,
chiefing out the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it raises a really personal
point to me because I've actually I've cut
[SPEAKER_00]: down my usage quite a bit over the past
year and I'm perfectly happy with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's made me realize when I go have a
hit of some of the strains I used to be
[SPEAKER_00]: puffing on all day, it sends me flying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can totally empathize with older
guys who are like, I just want something
[SPEAKER_00]: that tastes good and doesn't destroy me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that this will become a
growing kind of demand in the market?
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually we'll almost see like a
divergence of strains where there's like
[SPEAKER_00]: the everyday stone of strains and then the
more casual guy ones, because being in
[SPEAKER_00]: that more casual sort of like let me just
put it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone gives me some weed and I and
it's strong and I hit it, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just my day is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that I was in the Colorado
market when that first legalized in rec.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what one of the highest
sellers was the first two years was the
[SPEAKER_01]: rookie cookie, which was a five milligram
cookie, five milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so there's a huge market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would probably say it's 30, you know,
an enormous percentage of the market of
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are their weekend warriors,
the people that haven't smoked in 20 years
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they they don't want to get
obliterated and they don't know how to
[SPEAKER_01]: dose themselves like with a joint or a
bong or certainly not with dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so they need a way that they can dose
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I've worked with a bunch of
different technologies that we'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing to market later this year that
help with that, that we're not ready to
[SPEAKER_01]: release publicly yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have a new facility that we're
pretty close to getting ready here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oklahoma in the next couple of weeks that
will in August we'll have some
[SPEAKER_01]: announcements about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have a couple of different versions
of stuff that allow us to adjust the
[SPEAKER_01]: potency and maintain the terpenes and a
couple of other cool things that will
[SPEAKER_01]: allow us to give some more rookie versions
of those types of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think you are going to see a huge
demand for those more lower potency
[SPEAKER_01]: products, because, again, that really is
the vast majority, the people that dab all
[SPEAKER_01]: day and the people that smoke lots of
blunts and joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the people that grow use it
pretty heavily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're not the majority of users.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're probably we're five, 10 percent of
the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a very small minority of the overall
cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to all remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of us forget that
because we get so used to the dab culture
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything that we forget that most
people just smoke joints on weekends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So or after work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it's interesting you raised
the point about the rookie cookie,
[SPEAKER_00]: because my next question to you is going
to be, do you think there are any major
[SPEAKER_00]: leaps to be made in the edibles field?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think it's simply just about
making it taste better and less like weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think there's like some next
generation leap that might happen that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it even better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, there's a ton of advancements in
bioavailability that are not being
[SPEAKER_01]: exploited right now in the market without
getting into specific specifics and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting myself into trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of different ways that you
can rapidly increase the potency of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and sometimes, you know,
five X and efficacy or even more by
[SPEAKER_01]: changing some variables and and changing
the way that your body looks and uptakes
[SPEAKER_01]: the molecules, be it CB1 or CB2 receptor
or some of the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get down some pretty cool rabbit
holes again, without getting myself into
[SPEAKER_01]: trouble with NDAs that I've signed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we won't we won't go too far in that
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's there's definitely some cookies
for people to go follow up on them if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're so interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the topic of edibles, I was
interested in picking your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like there's any difference in
the quality of edibles produced in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of the strains used?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't just mean like in terms of the
yield you might get back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you think a certain strain makes a
better edible or it's it's a process to
[SPEAKER_00]: the point that you kind of lose that sort
of originality of the strain it came from
[SPEAKER_00]: originally?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's kind of a two part
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first part I would say is that one,
terpenes absolutely are going to have an
[SPEAKER_01]: enormous impact on the efficacy of your
medicinal value of your edibles,
[SPEAKER_01]: the same way that they do for smokables.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, let's just take example seizure
medications.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so if you have CBD, OK, and I have and
I treat someone with CBD and they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: respond, OK, you there's certain
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, certain terpenes that you can
combine with CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the exact ones,
but I know that what's his name?
[SPEAKER_01]: House of Harlequin, Wade Laughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: He talked about it extensively when he was
on my show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was episode 140 of the
Growing with Fishes podcast, if you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to know exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: He talks about the specific terpene groups
in that episode, but there's certain
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes that actually will help
dramatically suppress cannab seizures when
[SPEAKER_01]: taken with CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's other ones that will
antagonize them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take Pinene and terpenaline and
beta carofaline, those are
[SPEAKER_01]: hyperstimulative terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not want those as a seizure
patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to avoid those explicitly because
they can induce seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might have someone as a CBD
cultivar that's high in those that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: getting relief from their seizures or even
having them induced by them, whereas you
[SPEAKER_01]: take that same patient and give them a CBD
cultivar with those different sets of
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and absolutely have efficacy with
that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's absolutely a thing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I found that and this goes
back to when I was first doing this back
[SPEAKER_01]: old school in the free people's market was
doing decarboxylation in sealed vessels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would do it in mason jars or in a
pressure cooker or some kind of other
[SPEAKER_01]: sealed thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And initially we did it was to see
basically to not let the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhood or apartment complex know
that we're cooking, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a problem if I'm making a big
batch, you know, everyone knows in the
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhood, you know, my house smells
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you're in a less than legal
area, that can be a very big problem
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on who your neighbors are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we originally did that, but what we
realized was we were trapping the terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the method that I prefer to
decarboxylate if you're decarboxylating
[SPEAKER_01]: flour for those at home that are making
their own edibles is take your flour,
[SPEAKER_01]: dry it out, and then fill your mason jars
up about 50% of the way, and then put them
[SPEAKER_01]: in the oven and cook them at about 240
degrees for, you know, one hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll decarboxylate your stuff
really, really, really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also trap those terpenes in and
also won't stink your house up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll smell maybe like you're smoking a
joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you'll know that there's weed there,
but it's not going to bomb the house out,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you take those and put them in the
fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that's going to do is cool and
condense any of the compounds that were
[SPEAKER_01]: turned into a gas, mainly your terpenes,
allow them to recondense back onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant material and come back out of the
gaseous form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that means that when I take that and
now use that for making my edibles,
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's now rebound back up on the
plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what I prefer to do is I'll take that
half of decarboxylated jar, and I'll fill
[SPEAKER_01]: it two thirds of the way with my oil or
butter or whatever I want to infuse,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll throw that in a pressure cooker
and we'll pressure infuse that and
[SPEAKER_01]: decarboxylate that or, you know,
we'll decarboxylate it first and then
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll pressure infuse it for, you know,
30 to 40 minutes in a pressure cooker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, five to 10 PSI, real low PSI,
real, real low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, just enough to get that
pressure on the jar and then take those
[SPEAKER_01]: out and then take that strain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I have my infused oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the easiest ways for
people at home to make high quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: high potency decarboxylated oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't have to use a pressure
cooker, but it does help.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I did want to add to that,
don't do the butter or oil and then put
[SPEAKER_01]: them in the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have a pressure cooker,
they will explode in the oven.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to do that method with the
jar infusion, you do have to put it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure cooker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have even pressure on the
outside and inside, otherwise they will
[SPEAKER_01]: explode, just as a safety thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very valid point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we just jump back to the Africa
stuff for a minute, I just wanted to touch
[SPEAKER_00]: on a topic you mentioned way back,
but I put a little dot because I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: come back to it is you were talking about
how with your aquaponics system,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could get away with, I think you said
about 18% of the water usage is some other
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it immediately made me think for,
for somewhere like Africa or anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's like a water scarcity,
that's got to be one of the determining
[SPEAKER_00]: factors in terms of the system you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Places like island nations in the
Caribbean, Australia, Africa, particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: island nations, because they don't have a
big water supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a gentleman who does,
I can't remember the name of his farm,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he's in Barbados that is now also
doing cannabis, but he was doing
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was doing it because their entire
total gallonage of fresh water on the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole island is very limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: They only get so much rain and that's all
the fresh water they have unless they
[SPEAKER_01]: bring it in or desalinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having an area that, especially when
they're hyper limited on that and cutting
[SPEAKER_01]: that down can be a great way to reduce the
water per crop yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can even further reduce it if
you're in extreme measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I don't recommend this for commercial
cannabis production because the liability
[SPEAKER_01]: of if your indexing valve fails,
you can lose five rows of cannabis in a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're doing it for vegetable
production and you're willing to gamble
[SPEAKER_01]: that or have someone that's just actively
inspecting them every few hours,
[SPEAKER_01]: which you can do when labor costs are
cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can do that with indexing
valves where I can run just enough water
[SPEAKER_01]: to do one trough and the sump to take that
back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can run four or six troughs of
plants, whoever length off of one body of
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can get extremely low in terms of
total water volume for a large amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants per run in extreme cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've done vegetable production that
way in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some cannabis with that
methodology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I try to avoid it with cannabis
because it's too much of a liability.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have an equipment failure,
I just lost a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you do not ever want to explain that
to someone you're working for because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to go well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can certainly imagine that
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of when they've finished growing
the product and they're going to harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: it, they're going to dry and they're going
to process it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What sort of things happen there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we see the sort of drying techniques
you might see on, say, Mr. Nice's
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram feed where there's like these
crazy warehouses just with tons of biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: just all drying out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it like that or is it a bit more like
out in the sun?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they dry and process and manage all
of the biomass once it's grown?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking in Africa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, apologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Africa, remember Zimbabwe was the
tobacco capital of the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tobacco, it has this enormous tobacco
infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have these huge brick tobacco
barns that are an acre, two, three,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes four acres in size that are
basically just corrugated steel and brick
[SPEAKER_01]: and some local wood to timber them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's huge bays and they have these
furnaces on the end where they heat them
[SPEAKER_01]: up and they run warm air through them to
heat the tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're basically taking those and
cleaning them up, running ozone through
[SPEAKER_01]: them so they can kill all the bad microbes
or anything that might be living in there
[SPEAKER_01]: to sterilize them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then converting those into cannabis
drying barns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at least on a large scale,
I've seen three separate farms in
[SPEAKER_01]: Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a chance to visit some of our
competitors, not competitors, but other
[SPEAKER_01]: producers, I guess is probably the better
way to put it in Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were all all of us included.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of us were using old tobacco
properties because they have the well
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the irrigation infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the water reservoirs and they
have the tobacco drying barns.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the tractor buildings that we
can use for extraction and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has kind of the pre-built
infrastructure or at least the framework
[SPEAKER_01]: for a pre-built infrastructure that maybe
it needs to be brought up to code.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I need to update things in terms of
modernization, but 80% of what I need is
[SPEAKER_01]: already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of the processing,
does it take place in Africa or does it go
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere else?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they do that part?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of ways that happens from
African countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one way that it happens is they'll take
it, dry it and ship it out as dry biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another way that they'll do it is take it
and separate the oil and then sell that
[SPEAKER_01]: and basically 55 gallon drums of oil or 30
gallon drums of oil or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other way that they'll do it is
they'll dry it say down to 40 or 35%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they'll ship it to Australia and dry
at five more percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's processed in Australia and
now it can qualify for Australian GMP and
[SPEAKER_01]: thusly EU GMP and backdoor into the EU.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a lot of companies that are
producing in other parts of the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: be it South America or Africa that are
backdooring it into the EU.
[SPEAKER_01]: market via Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know how long that door is
going to last, but at least currently
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a way that some of the larger
companies are doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I haven't moved anything since
February, January, February.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that could have changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't quote me on that and say that I was
wrong if that's changed since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was how it operated up until
things started getting crazy over there in
[SPEAKER_01]: Africa and I came back in April.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, of course all comments
taken in good faith.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned earlier and I wanted to
specifically ask about this, the price of
[SPEAKER_00]: the oil, it's astronomically low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I heard before we even chatted a
few months back, someone quoted something
[SPEAKER_00]: like $200 a gallon or just something which
just blew your mind open.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think that's going to do to
the global kind of pricing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it like, what is the price?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's the going price over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know what the current price in
Africa is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were all looking at refining it into
internet, mostly European markets without
[SPEAKER_01]: getting into specifics that may or may not
get me in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was all going into European
markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could tell you what that price was,
but I don't know what the low ball stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're seeing out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big company at La Soto and a
couple other places.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also know that we originally wanted to
get launched in South Africa and then
[SPEAKER_01]: South Africa started randomly arresting
producers that were legally licensed that
[SPEAKER_01]: were not violating anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got real sketched out about throwing
a bunch of money down there and I
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly don't want to spend any time in
a South African jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hear it's not a very good place to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we decided to move up to Zimbabwe where
it was a little more stable and then now
[SPEAKER_01]: that's happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things have gotten a little bit more
interesting in Zimbabwe than they were
[SPEAKER_01]: when I was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'll kind of see how it all works
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of have some different assets in
different African countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that was kind of the plan too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of know that if you're going to
get involved in Africa, Africa doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: always have the best stability when it
comes to government and regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of have to diversify across a
couple of countries and have, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of one export company that can kind
of conglomerate the output of those
[SPEAKER_01]: different countries into, you know,
set contracts for different different
[SPEAKER_01]: people internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the easier way to
operate over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't matter what type of
agricultural crop, if we're doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maize or corn or whatever,
you know, or cannabis, it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of them pretty much operate that way
by diversifying across nations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, it just changes too often
over there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just to go back to yet another
point you mentioned much earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: you said that you did come across some of
the more indigenous cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: the land races, but they just weren't
suitable for what you needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones you did come across, did you feel
like they were likely affected genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: by some modern form or they were likely
untouched?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I look forward to bulking them out
and giving out a bunch of seeds for people
[SPEAKER_01]: to tell me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually one of the plans I'm
working with Mr. Green Jeans Garden in
[SPEAKER_01]: California to bulk out a bunch of those so
that we have those available for people to
[SPEAKER_01]: give out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I found that they are incredibly high
in it's like smoking a pine tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was the thing I instantly
noticed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the cerebral high that I don't
remember having since I was maybe a
[SPEAKER_01]: teenager, you know, just a mind blowing
cerebral sativa high that it was
[SPEAKER_01]: intoxicating and just, I haven't had in
just such a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just was, I just, I missed it and I
forgot that I missed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as a lover of sativas myself,
that sounds beautiful in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: local population and the local culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's cannabis consumption like over
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do people generally grow and smoke it or
it's just not really used?
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis is a very hush hush thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can get you, well, the locals can get
seven to nine years in jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they generally don't share it very
often.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you will find that like in private,
well, okay, let me make sure I don't get
[SPEAKER_01]: myself or anybody else in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: In private areas and private clubs and
things like that, it is fairly well
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've smoked in public quite a few times,
but again, it was gated public,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was not, not like you had to pay
to get in, but like it was on like a
[SPEAKER_01]: balcony or it was like in a courtyard,
an area where you kind of had to get,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, go into the bar and back out the
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was kind of a off on the side
kind of thing, kind of off, maybe kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: the way it used to be in Canada before
2004.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe anyone that remembers those days
where it was accepted, but kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: keep it on the DL.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not so much BC, but certainly more
towards the Quebec side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of, kind of in that vein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but out in the country, like,
you know, shit, we smoked all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was no big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, and then out with the Rasta.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of Rastafari and they
smoke in chief up and that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously anywhere near them, you're going
to have a cloud, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but, but, but in general, culturally
speaking, it's not very popular except for
[SPEAKER_01]: like at the bars that you go to a bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has a courtyard outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll smell it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it'll often be like stuff that like
Mexican brickweed people wouldn't buy,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be something that like looks
like pine needles and it's like probably
[SPEAKER_01]: 80% leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe there might be like a little bit
of maybe 0.1 to 0.2 grams out of a gram is
[SPEAKER_01]: an actual bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe like 0.3 grams of that
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like the rest is like leaves or
like some other part of the plant that's
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then that's on the low end and
then all the way up to stuff that would
[SPEAKER_01]: compare with like Cali stuff, like,
like really good high quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some of the people over there are
taking notes and watching YouTube and
[SPEAKER_01]: listening to podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there, I mean, it's show you
instantly, you can tell who who's paying
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to, to education and who,
who knows what a sense of Amelia is and
[SPEAKER_01]: all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who doesn't, because, you know,
one, one is bushweed and one is a
[SPEAKER_01]: something that looks like it came from a
store here, you know, yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and that's, that's so promising to
hear that there are, there are people
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing the craft and the art down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I've wondered is, you know,
days gone by and probably less so
[SPEAKER_00]: Zimbabwe, but you know, historically
there's been certain African countries
[SPEAKER_00]: which have been notable for the kind of
unique hash they put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it often historically it would go to
Amsterdam and that's how it kind of got
[SPEAKER_00]: the reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like as more modern production
comes in, there'll be probably,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll see an end to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like maybe not Zimbabwe, but other
countries that are known for their hash,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll fall off a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think it'll always be there?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is no show no word for hash
Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one in Zimbabwe knew what hash was,
knew what a dab was like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A large part of Africa doesn't know what a
concentrate is like, or the concept of
[SPEAKER_01]: thereof, but like smoking also is more of
a taboo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just smoking anything is more taboo
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just culturally than here,
like in terms of general acceptance,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, yeah, people smoke cigarettes and
you can buy them or whatever, but like
[SPEAKER_01]: not, it's, it's, it's more like living in
some of the more literally really
[SPEAKER_01]: progressive areas where there really isn't
that many people smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just not, they,
they export all that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like the dirty white people
thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was not, not trying to be
racist, but like that was, that was kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of thing that they kind of were like,
yeah, that's for them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's not for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not trying to be derogatory by saying
that, but culturally that that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: how it is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No heck in, in terms of if we're talking
about tobacco, I can, I can get behind
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's not something I need,
but you've made me realize this is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the longest we've ever gotten to
an interview where we're finally going to
[SPEAKER_00]: say, all right, time for the usual first
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: First experience with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my first experience, I remember having,
I don't remember my first experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can remember the first time getting
really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that that I could tell you
clear as day was going and I was working
[SPEAKER_01]: at a cyber cafe at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew one who knows me knows exactly
the cyber cafe in the town where I grew
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there used to be a train station near
there with a guy named Dan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went there with a friend of mine
and Dan and Pat, and we went over there
[SPEAKER_01]: with a ceramic bowl that he had made an
art class that looked like a dragon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had packed a bowl of some good shit
that one of them we got from a relative
[SPEAKER_01]: and man, and it was a good spot because of
the train station, you could watch the
[SPEAKER_01]: police station and we were kind of up in
elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they pulled out, we could peace out
before they had a chance to come up to
[SPEAKER_01]: where we were and be out or, you know,
at least have a chance to hide your weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a good place to sit and smoke if
you're a teenager because it's hard to get
[SPEAKER_01]: snuck up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we used to go up there and man,
I just, I remember that first time going,
[SPEAKER_01]: holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is and then the day after that
was the first time I ever got so high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't get off the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how did that progress?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you quite quickly start smoking more
regularly or it took a bit of a while?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I kind of was off and on and then I
didn't really start smoking heavily until
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe four years later and that I was
starting to get sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I was, so I have a
digestive track issue and I have issues
[SPEAKER_01]: digesting things and I was glute,
I'm hypersensitive to gluten and it causes
[SPEAKER_01]: me all kinds of getting into gross
details, unpleasantries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with my digestive system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started smoking more and more and
more flour because it was a thing that was
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing me to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gaining weight again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't in pain and it was like,
like solving a long list of my health
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally I was dating this girl
and she goes, have you tried a raw food
[SPEAKER_01]: diet and just, you know, make just
eliminating the possibility that it's your
[SPEAKER_01]: diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, no, I haven't, but you know
what, screw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've tried everything else and let's
just try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we did that and found out that that
was the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then after that, I smoked a little less
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got, when I moved out to
Colorado in 2010, or 2011 or whatever it
[SPEAKER_01]: was, got into concentrates and then really
got a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suddenly that was like, Oh my God,
I can be a normal person again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like medically, like I can feel like a
normal, the way I used to before I started
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was really a huge change for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what really made me commit my life to
cannabis was working at the aquaponic
[SPEAKER_01]: source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had this guy come in and his son,
the first time he came in, he was a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis refugee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his son was dropped to a stroller.
[SPEAKER_01]: He couldn't move.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was completely unaware of the world
around him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, he was disconnected from
reality and they had just moved there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to buy a system for himself to,
he wanted to grow his son's medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to like, you know, get his son
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: This next time I saw them was three months
later, that kid opened the door on his
[SPEAKER_01]: own, ran in and started smacking eight
ounce measuring glasses and shot glasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cried for like an hour straight because
that kid was functionally a vegetable
[SPEAKER_01]: three months earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's in here smashing stuff now acting
like a little boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the best gift you can give any
human being.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I can do even half of that for
somebody else, that's what I'm gonna do
[SPEAKER_01]: every day till I'm dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, that's what got me to
commit to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I've gone on this long,
crazy train of riding the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industries up and down throughout all
these different industries and countries
[SPEAKER_01]: and all the different craziness that it's
brought me and the different projects I've
[SPEAKER_01]: worked on and you know, makes it easier to
get through when something like the virus
[SPEAKER_01]: suddenly pauses your project.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, eh, I'm still doing this for
a reason that I'm a thousand percent
[SPEAKER_01]: behind and I'm not even gonna trip on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a powerful and personal story there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That made you really kick the gear into
shift in terms of kind of seeing that the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community wasn't really utilizing
aquaponics in the way that it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it that got the fire under your
ass about getting the message out there
[SPEAKER_00]: about aquaponics and cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've always been a big adequate
proponent of the pet trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was been a big involved with
aquaponics, I'm sorry, aquarium societies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was heavily involved with the Bucks
County Aquarium Society when I was younger
[SPEAKER_01]: and working in the pet trade, the pet
trade and the drug trade have a heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of overlap in case anyone's ever
not worked in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of things that get
shipped in boxes from point A to point B
[SPEAKER_01]: and get labeled as plants or fish or other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not always what you think is
in the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got exposed to a whole lot of things
that maybe not everyone else my age was
[SPEAKER_01]: exposed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned how to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that we did at one
of the places allegedly that I worked at
[SPEAKER_01]: that we would do is take the filtration
from the freshwater systems that would
[SPEAKER_01]: separate out all the fish waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we use that on the cannabis plants as
organic fertilizer because we were trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to cut down on the amount of fertilizer
that we were buying because you're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to reduce the amount of red flags that
might get you busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So allegedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had kind of worked with that a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had gotten into soil growing
later on, not long after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of went down that rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I still always use kind of like tea
from what I would do my water changes and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd suck all the fish waste out of the
gravel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always and the plants always just
kicked butt when we did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was always kind of fiddling with it
kind of half halfway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got into river tanks, which is
basically aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're familiar with it was a product
inserts for aquariums that allowed the
[SPEAKER_01]: aquarium water to kind of flow through
little channels where it had plant pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put soil and it would kind of
automatically water the plants and filter
[SPEAKER_01]: the water at the same time and really
allow for a healthy ecosystem for
[SPEAKER_01]: reptiles, mainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had been doing aquaponics,
but I didn't call it aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We called it river tanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that we just didn't have the
terminology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never exposed to that word.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I when I came out west,
I worked helping grow some cannabis with
[SPEAKER_01]: some friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the flood happened in 2012 in
Colorado, when we had the heavy floods and
[SPEAKER_01]: it took out the the we had a big mud wall
at the place where I was working at the
[SPEAKER_01]: obliterated half the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was suddenly out of a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I applied for I typed in the word aqua
on Craigslist and got hired at the
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics source because they were just
moving to a new place.
[SPEAKER_01]: They needed someone that could help with
both the lab and product development at
[SPEAKER_01]: the time when Sylvia Bernstein was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was kind enough to give me a
chance over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hired me because I had, you know,
an immense amount of experience both with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and in vegetables and everything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked briefly for a company called
Blood Good Landscape, which is the oldest
[SPEAKER_01]: landscaping company in the entire United
States based in Horsham, Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've been around since the 1700s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have an incredible place there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got a chance to learn large scale
IPM and fertigation and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: working with with, you know, trees and
bushes and shrubs and annuals for people's
[SPEAKER_01]: landscapes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I worked, you know, selling plumbing
kits and designing stuff for ponds there
[SPEAKER_01]: on the side, helping him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a chance to kind of get into that
kind of scale before jumping into
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, but having that kind of cannabis
experience kind of on the side at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So coming into Colorado and having those
kind of dual skill sets really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really worked out well, coming into the
cannabis industry and working on the
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger scale of things and and made it an
easy trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I transitioned working with the aquaponics
source and then we did a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they wanted it two weeks after I
was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes, so we're thinking about doing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was a trick question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're they're trying to see if I
smoke weed or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to see if I admit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to fire me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just totally played dumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she about she like adjourned the
meeting and I was like, oh, you were
[SPEAKER_01]: serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so we sat down and then we ended up
doing the whole project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started working with the gentleman
in Robbie, who was actually just on my
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast last episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And him and I did a ton of R&D with
cannabis and a whole bunch of different
[SPEAKER_01]: setups and aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything from waking beds to dual root
zones and media beds to DWC to dual root
[SPEAKER_01]: zones to to 55 gallon drums to like any
kind of combination or setup you could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to figure out what's the
best commercial viable way, because we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to figure out how can we sell more
aquaponics systems and how can we turn
[SPEAKER_01]: this into a heavily commercial production?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we further produce fruit fruiting
crops, you know, not just cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but anything we learn from cannabis is
going to help increase production for
[SPEAKER_01]: peppers and tomatoes and cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of those things are easily
transitionable over in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we worked hard on not only medicinal
herbs and essential oil crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also cannabis production in an R&D
greenhouse that we had 50 by 30 by 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did a bunch of additional
experimentation with climate control
[SPEAKER_01]: models and stuff like that with geothermal
and solar water heaters and some other
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that we can get into if you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did a whole bunch of cool R&D on
that and really got a chance to wrap our
[SPEAKER_01]: heads around stuff and figure out what
works, what doesn't, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what could work if we did some changes and
really kind of splay that out and figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out how to make it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, we kind of just took that
and ran with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we started working with a medical
dual root zones where we have a soil zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really allowed us an extra layer
of control where we can supplement,
[SPEAKER_01]: not only supplement nutrients,
but have additional microbial zones,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, mycorrhizal fungi are incredibly
important for anything that's heavy in
[SPEAKER_01]: lignin and having done a wide range of
crops and aquaponics, the more wood and
[SPEAKER_01]: lignin a crop contains, the more of a soil
area you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're doing fruit trees,
you might do a dual root zone pot that's
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe two thirds soil to one third flood
and drain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas on a cannabis, you're going to be
more 50, 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on a lettuce, you might be able
to just straight DWC.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might not even need soil at all
because it doesn't need any, there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: lignin at all on that plant hardly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that lignin content is heavily
dependent on some of the metabolites from
[SPEAKER_01]: the fungal inputs that come from the
fungal part of the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have them, you either will
not get very good growth or you'll get
[SPEAKER_01]: strange or retarded growth, or you'll get
a lack of fruiting production.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the three, depending on what fruit
tree species we're talking about or genus
[SPEAKER_01]: at least that I've worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so many questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one which comes to mind for me
is for you in your mind right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the ideal composition of your root
zone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want all living organic soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want like what you just mentioned,
maybe a 50, 50?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would you be shooting for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my ideal setup for a cannabis plant
would be 50, 50 living soil with a layer
[SPEAKER_01]: of burlap or cloth or other root permeable
membrane that would separate the soil from
[SPEAKER_01]: the flood and drain and then lava rock
below that to get some trace minerals and
[SPEAKER_01]: anything else inside of a contained pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I prefer plastic and I know people
don't like that, but plastic or ceramic
[SPEAKER_01]: over cloth pots because the cloth pots
don't give you a seal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have a nice seal on the side of it
with plastic or ceramic, when the water
[SPEAKER_01]: floods and drains in the bottom half of
the pot, like it does with the dual root
[SPEAKER_01]: zone pot, it creates a diaphragm action
that causes a forced gas exchange through
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only is the lower half breathing
and getting better gas exchange,
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil is getting better gas exchange,
meaning all of the soil microbes are even
[SPEAKER_01]: happier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gives you this added benefit of
almost a lung effect going on in the root
[SPEAKER_01]: zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a brilliant way to kind of help
people conceptualize the sort of gas
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange that's going on with the
diaphragm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a question I like to ask most of our
guests is, you know, specific to you in
[SPEAKER_00]: this case is, do you remember your first
aquaponic harvest and will it always be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, this golden thing in your
mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we always talk to organic growers
and they're like, man, that first organic
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, I'll always remember it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first crop I did, I harvested it
entirely too early and I gave it way too
[SPEAKER_01]: much sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like starting to droop leaves
because I had suffocated the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it tasted great, you know,
but I definitely remember just the
[SPEAKER_01]: sweetness and how it almost tasted like
caramel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like smoking caramel and it was an
island sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, that's the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go back and look at my very first
article I did with high times on
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics, it's the plant that's in that
picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was the first one we did that was
full term with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did pictures with that one and that we
did in aquaponics that was of any kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: size.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had done some small stuff before that
was pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did some other stuff that wasn't pure
aquaponics, but that was the first one
[SPEAKER_01]: that was pure aquaponics start to finish,
including flowering and everything in
[SPEAKER_01]: between, you know, from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that island sweet skunk is that cut to
this day was still existing.
It just stopped growing and then they cut
it.
So that's pretty cool, right?
Yeah.
So that was all of those seven years.
I didn't do it for ese next year,
but it was certainly fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd go back, I'd read a few books in
the Dendro area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave some to the dude from Dudegros and
a couple other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know he's raved about it for a while on
his show as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know you're also a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, shout out to our mutual
buddy, Breedr Steve for creating such a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, one thing about Breeder Steve,
he's the original person to write about
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics and any kind of written form
back on Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the very first person and you can go
back and search.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've searched the internet top and bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the very first person to ever write
about anything that you could call
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics with cannabis in documented
form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was back in 1996 or 97 on overgrow
.net.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a cool little tidbit from the
archives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the aquaponics is going well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all starting to come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: At what point did you have the idea for
starting the Potent Ponics podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Potent Ponics podcast started actually
as a debate between Marty and I.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marty and I were debating on whether or
not you absolutely had like what the
[SPEAKER_01]: differences was in yield between dual root
zones and non-dual root zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Marty and I kind of got into a heated
discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we realized we were the only people
that had enough experience to have that
[SPEAKER_01]: level of an argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we quickly became friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we both got sick and tired of
hearing you can't grow weed in aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We heard that a thousand times and we're
just sick and tired of it because we got
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and I've pulled six and a half
pounds off of a single plant in aquaponics
[SPEAKER_01]: that we planted in a greenhouse the last
week of July and pulled down in October.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't tell me you can't grow a lot of
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow a lot of weed on an aquaponic
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow psychotic amounts of weed on
an aquaponic plant if you do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can prove it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got evidence, video and everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we basically started the podcast as a F
you to everyone that told us that we
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't grow aquaponically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're like, screw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to put the education out and
teach everybody how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not every single trick that we know,
but 98% of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we put out education on how to do
it, then everyone can know how to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: and understand how it works and actually,
you know, they can wrap their heads around
[SPEAKER_01]: it and maybe they'll even convert it or
adapt it as part of their facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and one of the things is that we
see a lot of soil growers adapting it for
[SPEAKER_01]: their nursery facilities, because again,
the accelerated growth rate you get with
[SPEAKER_01]: the mothers, if you're just producing
clones for other people or you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, or you're producing a large
amount of plant volume for high turnover
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities, you need to kind of have,
you know, accelerated growth rate on your,
[SPEAKER_01]: your veg production and, and either,
you know, growing them out in size or for
[SPEAKER_01]: straight clone production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a grow, you know, even using it in a
large soil production facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: it makes a lot of sense to have it for
your nursery operations being aquaponics,
[SPEAKER_01]: even, even, you know, on, on, on just a
minor scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a powerful testament to the,
to the technology, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess for me, the question I want to
most know is what's it been like now to
[SPEAKER_00]: have been running for, you know,
over 200 successful episodes at such a
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous milestone in the podcast
industry, you know, seeing as we're still
[SPEAKER_00]: yet to crack 50 over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what have you learned in that time
and what's your key to success?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, one, just experience of
working with a wide range of different
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then two, you know, making sure you
spend a little bit of time to research
[SPEAKER_01]: your people before you interview them and,
and, you know, try to learn a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: about something that maybe they haven't
talked about in other podcasts or maybe,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, get them to go down a rabbit
hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we, both of us have had a lot of
really incredible conversations and really
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful explanations of some pretty
complex ideas and, and, and methodologies
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, biological mechanisms and
all types of things that, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kind of came of maybe even an
offhanded comment from someone in chat or,
[SPEAKER_01]: or a weird question or, or an afterthought
that maybe wasn't even on your original
[SPEAKER_01]: list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know someone that the coolest answers
I've gotten or someone that just randomly
[SPEAKER_01]: added offhanded question about something,
or maybe something that one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: panelists had, you know, it, it wasn't
something I had written down for original
[SPEAKER_01]: question list.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and not only that, just the
diversity of the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have so many different ways to
crack the nut that of growing cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing pest management and doing nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you got a hydroponics,
aeroponics, soil growing, living soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics and everything in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, you know, it's really interesting
to see how they different compare and how
[SPEAKER_01]: different one accelerates.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that it's always interesting to
me is seeing, you know, different
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid and terpene peaks with the
different production methods and how
[SPEAKER_01]: certain stressors because of those
different grow methodologies can really
[SPEAKER_01]: peak certain things as one of the things
I've always found really interesting,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when you're doing side by
sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that may be a certain weird
thing happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe your AC failed or a pump failed or,
you know, something else went wrong,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it causes a weird side reaction or a
weird peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a, oh, how can I say this without
getting myself into trouble?
[SPEAKER_01]: We had an anomaly happen that caused an
immense increase in THCV production in one
[SPEAKER_01]: of our grows that allowed us to kind of
chase the rabbit hole on what actually is
[SPEAKER_01]: the secondary increaser for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've managed to hit some pretty high
levels on THCV with some of our,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the clients that we're working with
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there really is a lot of
different that I think that's really an
[SPEAKER_01]: area where there isn't a lot of research,
especially with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be a way to really,
you know, pluck the strings the right way
[SPEAKER_01]: to piss off the plant, to really produce a
large amount of XYZ compound that might be
[SPEAKER_01]: a value commercially that is easily
replicatable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, look at something like corn smut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's use that as an example with corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have corn smut that they spray on the
corn, which increases, makes this
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful flavorful mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what they found and Mike West has
talked about this on my show, if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with him from Embark Health in
Canada, he was one of the people that was
[SPEAKER_01]: involved with, if you get a chance to see
some of the data, I believe it was from
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they noticed there was a dramatic
increase in CBT levels, which is a minor
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid from powdery mildew infected
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants that failed for PM also seem to
have elevated levels of CBT.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what if CBT ends up being, and this is
just for the sake of argument,
[SPEAKER_01]: that CBT ends up being like the next big
breakthrough in cancer drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have people intentionally
infecting flower rooms two weeks before
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest with powdery mildew to spike the
CBT.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is something that mechanically
might make sense or some, it might be a
[SPEAKER_01]: non-pathinject microbe that we spray on
the plants to boost something in a way,
[SPEAKER_01]: or it might be a GMO microbe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, people might get mad at
me for saying that, but you might have
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's human made or human
isolated, maybe not even human made,
[SPEAKER_01]: but maybe vat grown and that's isolated
from a natural source that increases an
[SPEAKER_01]: XYZ metabolite to spike a cannabinoid or
terpene that we use, that five years from
[SPEAKER_01]: now we can't even think of not using.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have something that's that much
of a breakthrough that suddenly increases
[SPEAKER_01]: THC by 10% or some other thing that we
just didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are all things that because of
the, some of the results that I've seen
[SPEAKER_01]: with different issues that we've run into
or variables that we've experimented with
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the amount of control that we
have with the dual root zone aquaponics,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've managed to really have more knobs
and buttons that we can turn and push and
[SPEAKER_01]: levers to pull to change things and have
more, more variables that can be changed
[SPEAKER_01]: in different parts of the system and allow
us to unlock some of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that again, is an area that
really could use a lot more flushing out
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot more research.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes me so excited to hear you talk
about that because I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to call on him again, thinking back to
when I spoke to Brita Steele, I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: myself, we kind of spoke about this,
not in the level you just did,
[SPEAKER_00]: but talking about how, you know,
when botrytis infects grapes, it led to
[SPEAKER_00]: the, like a creation of a new type of wine
and it on face value, you'd be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, I don't want botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you just said, it just speaks to
that philosophy so greatly, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess what I'd want to ask is kind
of relating back to Dragonfly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mentioned to me that they feel like
when your soil is really alive and
[SPEAKER_00]: popping, you can get different expressions
and you kind of alluded to that yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you noticed a consistent sort of
thing that comes out when you grow things
[SPEAKER_00]: aquaponically, like a consistent way,
the profile is affected or maybe the turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you noticed anything like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you think it's variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't quite make broad rules of thumb
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say across the board,
beta-carofaline is above, is elevated
[SPEAKER_01]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than beta-carofaline, it's the only,
off the top of my head, it's the only one
[SPEAKER_01]: that I can say is pretty universal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely spikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other ones in certain cultivars,
but that's the one I would say that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, any of them express in any kind
of a way are going to have a night and day
[SPEAKER_01]: difference with the aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really ringing a bell on any other
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, but that's great info in itself
because I mean, I was always surprised
[SPEAKER_00]: when I looked at like turpin analysis of
cookies and you'd see it had a good amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of beta-carofaline in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like, if that's what you grow
in, maybe you can get an even better turf
[SPEAKER_00]: profile out of aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the biggest increases we've had
strains go from 4% to 9% CBD with
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics versus soil control.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been a huge increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that there's a university that
was working with Green Relief
[SPEAKER_01]: Incorporated, which is one of the bigger
companies in Canada doing aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They noticed a 14% increase in THC
production against DWC controls with dual
[SPEAKER_01]: root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and then also against soil
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget, it was like 18%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was even more against the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and they have actual, there's a
published white paper on their breakdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the name of the paper or
anything, but you can look it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look up the aquaponics association
meeting for last year, I believe it's
[SPEAKER_01]: referenced in the conference meet there,
if you're trying to hunt that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, some great leads there for the
listeners to follow up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to jump back to our last question
about, you know, having accumulated all of
[SPEAKER_00]: this experience and knowledge from having
done your podcast for over 200 fantastic
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's one thing that's changed in your
mind since the start?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's a cool discovery you've learned
along the way?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the biggest thing I've taken away
from is thinking about microbes as a
[SPEAKER_01]: machine I can use to make things for me in
a plant way, like a plant useful way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a great example would be like
thinking of KNF as a machine that I can
[SPEAKER_01]: put plant inputs through to isolate
minerals or plant hormones or other plant
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial compounds to accelerate growth
rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a great example of this would be
something like lactobacilli.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lactobacilli are great because not only do
they outcompete most pathogens,
E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli, salmonella, listeria, they love to
feed on all of those things, which has
[SPEAKER_01]: been documented in both the meat
processing industry, but also the
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural processing industry and in
aquaponic production, specifically through
[SPEAKER_01]: the University of Kentucky State,
who did a research on both plant and fish
[SPEAKER_01]: production, were they able to get increase
in fish production of 10 to 15% in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of growth rate and plant production on
average 18 to 20% in most crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all aquaponics to the
University of Kentucky State.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe Pate is the guy that George Pate,
I believe is his actual name, is the guy
[SPEAKER_01]: who did the paper on that, a white paper
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was involved with the lactobacilli
part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I prefer to do with labs,
and I'm sure you've had other people on
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about labs on the show,
but I prefer to do it a little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I prefer to do kefir based labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll get kefir or kefir depending on
your culture, on how you say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a lactobacilli culture that seems
to have significantly higher levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: different vitamin B complexes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also works faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm doing this on a commercial scale,
I don't have time to wait days and days
[SPEAKER_01]: and days for this to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to work tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I do large gallons and large volumes
with kefir, it will go 24 to 48 hours and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this commercial production.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is again, a resin factory.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going after trying to baby
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have time for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do a kefir based.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do kefir and milk instead of the
traditional air collected stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we find we get dramatic increases in
growth rate compared to inside by sides
[SPEAKER_01]: doing everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else is identically the same,
just faster growth rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get better vitamin B complexes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you can do with that is that add
spirulina.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm doing four gallons, I do some
five gallon batches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm doing four gallons of milk,
I will add four cups of spirulina,
[SPEAKER_01]: two cups of kelp extract and top off
whatever's left over with water and put a
[SPEAKER_01]: lid on it and ferment that for anywhere
from three to five days the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you get the good culture of
microbes, it'll go anywhere from 24 to 72
[SPEAKER_01]: hours, depending on the temperature you're
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it'll do is it will separate your
phycocyanide and from the spirulina.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll also separate a lot of the oxens
from the kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And combining with the vitamin B gives you
kind of three major groups of plant
[SPEAKER_01]: stimulant compounds that will dramatically
increase both growth rate, but help with
[SPEAKER_01]: recovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I have a plant that's been mauled by
insects, that's been run over by a lawn
[SPEAKER_01]: mower, that's been, I don't know,
whatever you did, didn't water it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you overwatered it, whatever you did,
it's just, it's hurt and bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great fix it spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've put it on plants that had pepper
plants that had been watered in two and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves were so dry, they were crispy
like paper and crumbled to dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we put it on it and we had new growth
on every single leaf node within three
[SPEAKER_01]: days on dead stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does unreal stuff to plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just recently, last week had it on a
cherry tree that was completely
[SPEAKER_01]: de-foliated by Japanese beetles and we had
new growth on all the branches within five
[SPEAKER_01]: days of foliar application.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really just, it wakes the plants up
and says, hey, time to reboot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get going again and let's just go
fast and let's just crank it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't use it late in the flower,
never use labs foliarly in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can mess with the trichomes and great
for veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use it on the roots in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not ever use it on the trichome heads
in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What an absolute gold mine of knowledge
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got to quickly clarify cause this
is the question I probably get asked more
[SPEAKER_00]: than anything related to kind of what you
just said.
[SPEAKER_00]: We often hear the saying, you know,
you don't want to generally speaking apply
[SPEAKER_00]: really any foliars during flower cause it
can mess with the trichomes as you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then you'll often hear some people and
I'll acknowledge sometimes I say it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, you know, if you don't
have a lot of pistol production before
[SPEAKER_00]: week two, I mean, you could use it in the
first week, maybe the second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like that's detrimental or
would you say look, you know, at a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: point there's buds and that's when you're
damaging it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the issue is not the pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue is the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lactobacillic acid is a negative impact on
the trichomes themselves and it will
[SPEAKER_01]: directly impact resin production.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's a much bigger problem than
just turning the pistols different color
[SPEAKER_01]: like with the, with the pH changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to clarify that point,
if someone was early enough in flower that
[SPEAKER_00]: there was no trichome formation,
but they felt the plant really needed the
[SPEAKER_00]: fixant spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you still, you still have that pre,
that pre trichome production.
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember a lot of those trichome
heads, they're not developed yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that head's still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The initial cells are already present on
the leaf tissue, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just has to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so you're still damaging that site.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question I wanted to ask,
I mean, it's on the same topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking about KNF, it's a whole
world we can explore in its own right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A story, a story which has always stuck
with me, which I believe I think I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling this out of the libraries of my
own memory here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So forgive me if I'm wrong universe,
but I think I saw it on the Australian
[SPEAKER_00]: weed growing subreddit and this person was
saying they were doing an aquaponic
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis system and they were using,
I can't remember the number, maybe five,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe six different types of kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, if you use these
different types of kelp, you kind of cover
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever heard of anything like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what sort of KNF stuff do you like to
implement into your aquaponics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I think that part of that is coming
from a lot of the aquaponic people will
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you that seesaw or, or, uh,
uh, just kelp in general is kind of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the mineral fix it for aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know what mineral deficiency
I have, but if I put this random mix of
[SPEAKER_01]: trace minerals, it'll probably fix it and
it never does.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the general, you know,
with lettuce, when you're dealing with the
[SPEAKER_01]: low levels of nutrients they need,
yeah, it'll fix it most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem you have with cannabis is,
and this is a problem I see quite often
[SPEAKER_01]: with people that follow the direction with
cannabis specifically, is that what does
[SPEAKER_01]: kelp have a lot of?
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a lot of boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what happens if I do a lot of boron in
a closed system, I'm going to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: buildup of boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what does boron sort of displace?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also going to screw up my calcium
uptake because the boron to calcium ratio
[SPEAKER_01]: is very finicky.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I go too high on the boron,
I need to really up my calcium or my
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake is going to be all screwed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, uh, you end up with these,
these really big imbalances between the
[SPEAKER_01]: boron and the calcium that, that
chemically starts screwing stuff up and in
[SPEAKER_01]: their own right, um, with the people that
just kind of go balls to the wall with
[SPEAKER_01]: the, with the kelp extract and,
or the, the, the, the sea salt,
[SPEAKER_01]: the dilutions, which they usually end up
with sodium problems, but that's a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: other issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there, again, there's a lot of,
and I'm working on it currently on a book
[SPEAKER_01]: called, um, aquaponica, which would be
aquaponic cannabis book.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll kind of have all, all this stuff
broken down, all the different normal
[SPEAKER_01]: reference stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That far as minerals that people are going
to want to use and all, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what you can and can't use, why you
specifically shouldn't use certain things,
[SPEAKER_01]: just because all the different stuff that
I've kind of figured out over the years,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, because there isn't really a good
source of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the biggest problems is
there is no really reservoir other than
[SPEAKER_01]: the podcast that we've put out that I put
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't really anything specific to
aquaponic cannabis that really has any
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of, you know, weight behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's certainly nothing that's been,
been done on a commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's hard, you know, I,
I, I fully understand why someone coming
[SPEAKER_01]: into it just doesn't have a lot of
reference to it because unless you've
[SPEAKER_01]: listened to the podcast or taken,
you know, one of my classes, you're really
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to know what PPMs or stuff
should be at what, you know, what is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to kill your fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another great example would be Yucca
extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yucca extract or saponin is often used as
a wetting agent for both pest management
[SPEAKER_01]: products and for, for root drenches and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is it's incredibly fish
lethal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is so fish lethal that the Indians,
the Yurok Indians, among others in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern California would collect Yucca
roots and they'd squeeze the juice out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the roots and collect that juice as a
concentrate and put it in vessels and
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd evaporate it off and make an even
further concentrate out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they get a couple of guys with a
couple of those vessels that go upstream
[SPEAKER_01]: about a mile, wait for the salmon run,
pour it into the river and it would kill
[SPEAKER_01]: all the fish within about a quarter mile
of the river.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they'd have about half a mile or a
mile down, they have the whole village
[SPEAKER_01]: waiting in the river.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they collect all the fish as they float
by and then they cook them off and it gets
[SPEAKER_01]: rid of the saponin and then they can eat
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but that was literally used as a
method for, for, you know, entire tribes
[SPEAKER_01]: to feed themselves for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something that's well,
not only documented in Western culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this is documented going back 10,000
years that you shouldn't use saponin
[SPEAKER_01]: around fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's funny you mentioned that
because I remember when I was on your
[SPEAKER_00]: show, I brought that up and you were very
quick on the ball to be like, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you're in aquaponics guys,
don't use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, very valid point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just, you know, further, I just wanted
to say, you know, we're all really
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful for the archive of knowledge
you've put out around aquaponics because
[SPEAKER_00]: you certainly hit it on the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no other resource quite like your
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you just said raises a really
interesting point in terms of what do you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel it's important to supplement your
aquaponics system with versus what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: important to not supplement it with,
which you might, for example, bring over
[SPEAKER_00]: as a bad habit because, you know,
you could use me as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I come from soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might, you know, without your knowledge,
I might be like, man, saponins are
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, what's some good things to bring
with you and what's some things you should
[SPEAKER_00]: probably leave behind?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say things to avoid would be one
saponin, two brassicas as a companion
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I for some reason still see people suggest
that and I do not understand why anything
[SPEAKER_01]: in the mustard family kills my mycorrhizal
fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: It releases something called Lillipathy,
which is a loose term for chemicals that
[SPEAKER_01]: kill nearby anything else that's living.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used both for coral or for the roots
of plants or for it's used for a wide
[SPEAKER_01]: range of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically the plants brassicas do not
have associative mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 85% of the world's plants do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actively kill associative mycorrhizal
fungi because it inhibits their own
[SPEAKER_01]: growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they will not help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's something again that I still
see people suggesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one that I've learned this year in
particular in southern Oklahoma is do not
[SPEAKER_01]: grow cilantro anywhere remotely near
anything outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cilantro attracts aphids of every type.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a magnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Root aphids, regular tree aphids,
you know, cotton aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen entirely too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just all of it got trashed and just
nowhere near the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went to another vegetable grow
and found an incredibly bad root aphid
[SPEAKER_01]: infection, which I posted a couple of
pictures not too long ago on Instagram of
[SPEAKER_01]: probably the worst root aphid infestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, thankfully was not at a
cannabis farm, was at a vegetable farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, if that was at a cannabis farm,
we'd probably have to burn the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it looked like that, like I don't
honestly know what I would tell the owner
[SPEAKER_01]: if it was that bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: That like vegetables, people are a little
more OK with trashing everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I was going to say anyone who's ever
had to fight aphids in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: context, when they see that photo you put
up, there's a visceral reaction to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like you got punched in the
stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I got I got a picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you scroll down a little farther on my
Instagram, I got pictures of bong aphids
[SPEAKER_01]: from a grow I was called to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they should have called me probably
two two months before they actually called
[SPEAKER_01]: me over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every single plant probably had a
minimum of 15,000 aphids on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: an entire 100 by 30 greenhouse,
every single plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there was as much weight of aphids as
there was biomass of plant in that
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, they grow a biomass or insect frass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you could ferment all of that
and sell it as an IPM like we were talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you could maybe recoup your
costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, gosh, please, guys, just grow good
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I think the logical next
question is, would you be able to give us
[SPEAKER_00]: a basic rundown on how someone might be
able to go up setting about a relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: simple setup at their home if they're
interested in getting into aquaponics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or would you advise that unless you're
really ready to jump in, there might not
[SPEAKER_00]: be a sort of get your toes wet option per
se?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just say, you know, set up your
system like you're going to do for a flood
[SPEAKER_01]: and drain cocoa setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then instead of doing cocoa do dual
root zone pots, flood and drain,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cut your standpipe to four or
five inches and just flood and drain the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom half instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then top feed your upper half with
either automated like we do on a large
[SPEAKER_01]: scale or, you know, hand if you're just
doing a couple of plants at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll have a hell of a lot more
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have a lot better flavor on your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you're not going to have to do
a lot of adapting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to, you know, you could
absolutely do this if you don't even want
[SPEAKER_01]: to do with the fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do hydro dual root zone and
you'll still get an incredible increase in
[SPEAKER_01]: impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think anyone that even does this
with a hydro dual root zone will notice
[SPEAKER_01]: immediate difference in flavor against any
side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for someone who might exist like
myself in a little bit of a more warmer
[SPEAKER_00]: country most of the year, do you think
that that is quite problematic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think I've heard someone say
that, you know, like in Australia during
[SPEAKER_00]: peak summer, you're going to really
struggle to keep the fish alive because it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that just something I've misheard or do
you feel like it's not particularly more
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, I don't think that you're
going to have any more challenge than we
[SPEAKER_01]: do here in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, frankly, we're getting,
you know, you guys have very similar
[SPEAKER_01]: summer peak summertime temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anything, we might even top out a few
degrees higher than you guys Fahrenheit
[SPEAKER_01]: wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if we can do it here,
I don't understand why you guys couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that in Australia in
particular, I'd be much more concerned
[SPEAKER_01]: about doing geothermal cooling both for
your water and for your air.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the impact of pulling that cold
air out of the ground is going to make it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, much cheaper in terms of cost
effectiveness for climate control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, with the thermal mass you have
with the water, you can run coils in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground like we do here in Oklahoma,
where we run coils in the water and then
[SPEAKER_01]: run them underground just to wick the heat
off and the water sucks the heat in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can actually pull air temperature
degrees off of it by sucking it into the
[SPEAKER_01]: water using the thermal mass of the water
as a battery basically to suck
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures off and then bleed that off
underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can, again, turning that off
increases the temperature in the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just had about, you know,
two and a half degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's that's not trivial.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good amount of heat reduction for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially we're talking about BTUs on an
AC unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're chomping through power,
I feel you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question that came up for me
is in Australia, tilapia is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what sort of fish would you recommend
that might go well in one of these systems
[SPEAKER_00]: across the board and then maybe a specific
one for Australia?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is unfortunately tilapia is out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So across the board, I would say anyone
getting started, you know, depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: your tank size, but assuming you aren't
going anything incredibly small,
[SPEAKER_01]: go with koi or goldfish because they're
really bulletproof.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll tolerate all kinds of stupid
things that you might accidentally do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they have a good resale
value.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can almost always unload decent size
ones for people for their ponds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, regardless of what
country you're in, especially butterfly
[SPEAKER_01]: koi, butterfly koi are easily you know,
you're going to increase them
[SPEAKER_01]: exponentially per, you know, every inch
that you add them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're adding, you know, anywhere from
five to forty dollars U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: per inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on how big they already are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're talking quite a bit of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're talking about cannabis
production, we don't generally care about
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we do in terms of community
outreach, but most cannabis companies just
[SPEAKER_01]: want to turn as much profit as humanly
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of business model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that's your goal with your business
model, going with butterfly koi or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that really is going to be
your long term best bet or with tropical
[SPEAKER_01]: fish that you can again turn around a
resale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arowana's, Arapaima, other large fish that
people have a hard time raising in large
[SPEAKER_01]: tanks that you happen to have a whole
bunch of that's easy for you to do at the
[SPEAKER_01]: scale that you're operating at can be a
really, really great option financially.
[SPEAKER_01]: For Australia specifically, Murray Cod or
Jade Perch, both will work very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Murray Cod, I believe, will also go into
brackish water as a Jade Perch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I'm not the authority here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those guys, I would say, be careful of
anything generally that goes from
[SPEAKER_01]: saltwater to freshwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tend to absorb potassium at a higher
rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Salmonids in particular, unless you're
doing decoupled systems, which I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend because it adds a whole other
layer of complexity to your chemistry and
[SPEAKER_01]: just it adds money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It adds cost to your run as well,
which is pointless.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're trying to cut the cost
down, not Adam.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unless you're doing that, salmonids
are just not an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, for the same reason, because of
that mechanism that in just salinity also
[SPEAKER_01]: affects potassium uptake and chemically
with the fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the potassium levels that we're
running with cannabis will kill the fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, they'll have heart heart
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess for me to wrap up this little
segment quickly, I just want to know,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you always grow aquaponically or is
every now and again, you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: ah, you know, I don't have a pump on hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do some soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always prefer to do aquaponics,
but I still do living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love we've spoken about them earlier,
but I love dragonfly earth medicine and
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole living soil and sustainability
and ferments and moving into trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: develop as many many possible nutrient
sources as possible without outside
[SPEAKER_01]: sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's some of the stuff I'm working
on in the book as well as what nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: and ferments from KNF can I take and what
inputs can I take in ferment and add to my
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics system to replace those
minerals, kind of like you're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about with iron and other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iron is a particularly difficult one
because of oxidation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of the other ones can absolutely
be heavily supplemented.
[SPEAKER_01]: One that's often just to circle back to
silica again, silica is often people say
[SPEAKER_01]: ferment horse tail, which is a very common
plant worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe you guys even have that in
Australia, if memory serves me correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The downside with that is it has a
compound and it actually affects vitamin B
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake, which is going to slow my growth
rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you know, it has even more silica,
actually four times as much silica
[SPEAKER_01]: stinging nettle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone loves to ferment stinging
nettle already for the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're actually looking for silica,
forget the horse tail, horse tail can also
[SPEAKER_01]: heavily accumulate trace metals,
including heavy metals, which can cause
[SPEAKER_01]: you to fail for your testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in California, you could
actually ferment horse tail and cause
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself to fail your heavy metal testing
by accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you go with the stinging
nettle, you're going to avoid those issues
[SPEAKER_01]: because it doesn't tend to accumulate the
heavy metals in the same high rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll also add even more silica than
the horse tail will.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it's just one of those things
where once you start looking at some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the numbers on some of these ferments and
the breakdowns and you actually test them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you realize some of this stuff is actually
not what we thought it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's actually much better options
that we're already using as part of
[SPEAKER_01]: regimens that actually supply these other
minerals at a much better rate that we
[SPEAKER_01]: just didn't realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still so much to be learned, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: A question I wanted to ask is just a
really quick one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you use the ward from aquaponics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you use it as like a rooting
stimulating agent or do you still use
[SPEAKER_00]: something else to kind of clone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I've had immense research,
both mainly with aeroponic growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also with just plug growing with
aquaponics and media beds as well with
[SPEAKER_01]: accelerated growth rate with the roots as
well, particularly with moringa trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to root moringa trees within,
you know, 14 to 20 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're talking trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with cannabis, there's quite a few,
not only my own research, but there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: what's the name of the company?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other one's called poof or
poom.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a new company I just found out
about the last last week or so that has
[SPEAKER_01]: another fish waste based cloning product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both of them are based on fish waste
or fermented fish waste or dried fish
[SPEAKER_01]: waste or shelf stabilized fish waste for
cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of their research as well for both
of their independent companies also backs
[SPEAKER_01]: up my own data on the accelerated growth
rate from the fish waste as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, again, that increase in
microbiology biological activity from
[SPEAKER_01]: those mineral sources really seems to make
a market increase in and rooting rate and
[SPEAKER_01]: reduction in rooting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I kind of suspect it as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's lovely to hear that that
is the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we found that, you know, results with
everything from cannabis all the way to
[SPEAKER_01]: moringa trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moringa is in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing a ton of moringa cloning
because moringa is a bitch to Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you plant 10 seeds, two of them will
germinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can clone the living crap out of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It clones pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just cut it and stick it in a media
bed and let it flood and drain for two or
[SPEAKER_01]: three weeks and pull it out and you got a
tree you can plant in the ground and away
[SPEAKER_01]: you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can plant the whole forest pretty
quickly that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are all methods that you can do
and very rapidly scale up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was one of the things that we
worked with with the Rastafarian group in
[SPEAKER_01]: Kingston and Nyabingi was helping them get
some of that stuff going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what they're doing with it
now, but that was one of the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing as a main export was
grinding up moringa leaves and trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out how to increase that
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great info.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the last topics I wanted to
spend some time chatting about with you,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know that it's obvious by just
listening to the podcast thus far is
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got such an extensive knowledge on
IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping to pick your mind a little
bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess my first kind of question
would be, are there any common IPM
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments that you think people have kind
of got it wrong and they should maybe stay
[SPEAKER_00]: away from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I mean, something we've already
spoken about, saponins, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people use them as an IPM foliar
spray before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you be willing to do that if it was
say living soil or what would you use as
[SPEAKER_00]: your first port of call as a general sort
of spray to fight off some bugs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as far as general sprays for bugs,
my first go to just as a regular general
[SPEAKER_01]: spray, if we're not talking about off the
shelf stuff would be the IPM IMO that we
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about that we're doing in Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: For off the shelf stuff, if I had to pick
a single product that worked on the widest
[SPEAKER_01]: range of stuff, it'd probably be a product
called Kapow, which is lemongrass oil and
[SPEAKER_01]: castor oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had it work on everything from white
flies to spider mites to powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as a shotgun blast, that's going
to just hit everything that's going to not
[SPEAKER_01]: really negatively impact your plant or its
flavor that you can also use well into
[SPEAKER_01]: flour when diluted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the best as far as doing all of
those things simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're talking about single sprays for
mold, it would be probably a product
[SPEAKER_01]: called Sonata, which is a Bactylus
Pamilis, which I found is the hands down
[SPEAKER_01]: best product for mold of any type and any
type of indoor grow I've had the chance to
[SPEAKER_01]: work on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to knock back damn near anything
I throw it at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you know, it's Bactylus Pamilis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nothing crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nothing toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to worry about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yes, you have to wear your PPE
just for compliance reasons, but
[SPEAKER_01]: realistically, it's not going to hurt you
in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not like a chemical spray
or something like that where I have to
[SPEAKER_01]: worry about my nervous system or some
other issue that's going to be affected,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a bacteria, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as far as insects, beneficial
insects, I would have to go with lacewings
[SPEAKER_01]: and aureus hands down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys are and nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're kind of the the pillars
of any IPM that I'm going to do off the
[SPEAKER_01]: bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll kind of go into depending
on the climate, really, it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: change around that more than anything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what are the temperature ranges
that we're going to deal with an average
[SPEAKER_01]: day in that in that growth cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: And like right now in Oklahoma,
our current regimen that we're doing for
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much everything outdoor and
anything in greenhouse is radically
[SPEAKER_01]: different than anything I would ever do
indoor because it's all stuff that can
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerate 95 degrees or higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not a whole lot of insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your assassin bugs, your
californicus, your aureus and your rove
[SPEAKER_01]: beetles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a whole lot else that's going
to live past that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, once you get above 100
Fahrenheit, there's not a lot of insects
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to thrive in that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What great information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it does highlight, you know,
it's hard to give these generalized
[SPEAKER_00]: answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you got to be a bit specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you do a lot of consulting
work for a variety of people, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: for specifically IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: What types of things do you find you're
normally getting called in for and what
[SPEAKER_00]: are often the challenges you face?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I would say number one, people that
don't realize the, the mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies they currently have going on
other farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've gone to grows where their head
grower didn't know that they needed to
[SPEAKER_01]: balance the pH, the nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had been there for quite a few
months and had balked their way into the
[SPEAKER_01]: job somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've been into a grow where I watched
a head grower transfer stuff into a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had ungodly amount of money worth of
plants into it and then not prune off the
[SPEAKER_01]: damaged leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then immediately didn't even know that
he had an affection because he sprayed all
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff and thought it was just done
and thought it didn't even realize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he didn't know he was supposed to
prune off that like all kinds of just a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of just like rudimentary stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people that had pulled someone that
had done like a tent grow and then put
[SPEAKER_01]: them in charge of an acreage or,
you know, multi thousand square foot
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, look, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab someone that did cut flowers,
grab someone that did pansies,
[SPEAKER_01]: grab someone that did geraniums,
you know, who cares?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just any amount of scaled
agricultural experience, like at all,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, uh, really makes a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if someone just, you know,
even growing beans for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'll take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, the other thing that I
noticed is people that from the military
[SPEAKER_01]: are really easy to work with veterans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they're used to procedures,
SOPs, all that stuff there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're used to regimen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, you know, the, the, it has to be
done this way and it can't be done a
[SPEAKER_01]: different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't think for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do what the directions say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, they do to the point where
it's helpful and not to the point where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a hindrance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, uh, you know, I have been some of
the easiest people and we, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we often love to hire veterans for that
reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, a lot of the veterans are legally
able to have firearms in states that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're also allowed to have
them, you know, under premises with a
[SPEAKER_01]: license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're also great way to hire veterans
for easy jobs as far as, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a high paying job that they don't have to
do a whole lot, uh, and support people
[SPEAKER_01]: that maybe need a little extra help in
society.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, a lot of countries have a
hard time finding jobs for some of their
[SPEAKER_01]: veterans and it's a great way for our
community to support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we've, we talked about multiple
ways that we can support our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one more way that we can do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really lovely sentiment there to
try to help out people who maybe need a
[SPEAKER_00]: little extra help and have certainly
helped out others throughout their life in
[SPEAKER_00]: one way or another.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something I would not only that,
you know, if you think about what's the
[SPEAKER_01]: number one enemy of our industry education
or lack thereof.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so by, by just providing good
things in the community, it opens people
[SPEAKER_01]: up to the idea of educating themselves
about our industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to go out of my way to
convert them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will convert themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, kind of related to this
topic, we've seen that there's been a rise
[SPEAKER_00]: in education sort of events, platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw last year there was a whole range
of regenerative cannabis symposiums and
[SPEAKER_00]: you even mentioned yourself, you're now
doing aquaponic classes, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people should certainly jump on top of
that if they want to get the inside scoop
[SPEAKER_00]: on how to do it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you predict these will be more common
going forward and what's your hopes for
[SPEAKER_00]: the sort of educational classes that
you're involved in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been teaching educational classes
since 2013, um, both on vegetable side of
[SPEAKER_01]: things and on the cannabis side of things,
depending on who I was teaching for as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as medicinal herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a passionate herbalist as well as a
mushroom picker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to pick, uh, all different types of
wild mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to teach foraging classes in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the pleasure of going up with me,
uh, almost every way to come up with at
[SPEAKER_01]: least a grocery bag full of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, uh, and it's sustainably,
you know, we weren't out there taking
[SPEAKER_01]: everything out there either.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we were taking no more than 30
or 40% of what was out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So still leaving some behind it to be
there for the next generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something of them very powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm passionate about, but, um,
um, uh, we, Marty and I, uh, as the
[SPEAKER_01]: gentleman I do my podcast with,
we have a long format, uh, commercial lock
[SPEAKER_01]: upon a cannabis class that we'll be
releasing later this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we've been teaching a version.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been teaching a version of that class
since 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, we've since turned it from a two
day class into a four day commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: class, and then now into a week long,
uh, intensive course that we have filmed
[SPEAKER_01]: at a whole bunch of different locations of
the whole bunch of different chopped up
[SPEAKER_01]: cool stuff and, uh, just all different
types of interesting things that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: had, or, you know, maybe we can show you
an example of somebody that screwed up
[SPEAKER_01]: real bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe I just don't tell you where it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, we can show you a bunch
of stuff that maybe I just couldn't show
[SPEAKER_01]: you in a live class, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or an example of something that I just,
I had to be taken right then and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just shot us some footage,
some footage of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's all together in this nice,
nice, cool educational format.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also putting on, um, and you can
find more information on that at
[SPEAKER_01]: potentponics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we'll have that out hopefully in the
next, uh, uh, 45 to 90 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we're, we're almost finished
completing, uh, filming and then,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, we just have to edit it all,
edit it all up and add the extra stuff to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, we're also working on the virtual
Occuponic Cannabis Conference on October
[SPEAKER_01]: 30th, third and fourth, uh, which has a
wide range of different speakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we have Murray Hallam, which we spoke
about earlier this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's pretty much the leader in Occuponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he's based out of Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll also have Breeder Steve,
who we also talked about on the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we'll have Chris Trump talking about
Occuponic Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have Matthew Gates or Xanthanol,
who's one of the leading experts on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and pathogens, especially in
terms of, uh, evolutionary history and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uh, treatments and just,
um, uh, ah, he's just such a wealth of
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love talking to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Dr. Will Wilson Leonard, um,
another Occuponic great.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has the wonderful commercial Occuponic
Cannabis book, which I highly recommend to
[SPEAKER_01]: people if they're listening to this show
and they want to learn more about just
[SPEAKER_01]: general Occuponic and they want something
that's really an incredible reference
[SPEAKER_01]: guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's one of the most in-depth and
detailed books out there on the topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and one of the only ones that really
does a lot of things right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, don't always agree with anybody a
hundred percent of the time, but he,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, he has, uh, probably the single best
book out there in terms of system design.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's, that's currently on the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Roger Terry from True Occuponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a wonderful gentleman that I will
also work with on nutrient subscriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have an Occuponic system or you're
interested in getting a system up and
[SPEAKER_01]: running, um, he's a great place to get
nutrients from, or we can get you set up
[SPEAKER_01]: with a subscription service.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do provide a subscription service that
we test your nutrients for you and we
[SPEAKER_01]: provide you custom, custom nutrient
solutions for your Occuponic or hydroponic
[SPEAKER_01]: system based on your current nutrient
values, not based on some, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: part eight, part B solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can dial that nutrient within,
you know, a very small range, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: to specifically boost, you know,
heavy feeding cultivars or anything else
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're doing and make sure that
you're getting the production that you
[SPEAKER_01]: expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we also have Angela Tenenbrock,
um, uh, Tenenbrock, uh, she is one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: leading experts in biosafety and food
safety and one of the leading researchers
[SPEAKER_01]: in food safety and aquaponics for
vegetable production.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's going to be talking about,
um, biosafety and cannabis facilities and
[SPEAKER_01]: how to protect yourselves from biological
pathogens, how to stop the introduction of
[SPEAKER_01]: insects and pathogens into your grow in
the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, she's a wealth of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're ever trying to get compliant,
uh, with a government, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, certification or any type of audit,
um, she's a wonderful person to check out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marty Wydell, the cohost of my show,
uh, myself, uh, Brennan Strathman from
[SPEAKER_01]: Spectrum King, uh, as well as Grow More,
uh, Microbial, which is the first
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial archaea on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Leann Keys of Chief Cultivator on
Instagram or from Habitat Life.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's one of the, uh, if not the,
the best, um, head grower up there for
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponic cannabis production up in
Canada, up at Habitat Life.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's killing it up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he has some of the best cannabis
in BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they sold out in seven minutes the
other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, from their harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to give you an idea of how good their
weed is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and they have Josh Rutherford and
Dutch Blooms, the gentleman who puts on
[SPEAKER_01]: the regenerative cannabis conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an awesome guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to be talking about large scale
integration between aquaponics and soil
[SPEAKER_01]: production and how to utilize aquaponics
or mineralization from aquaponics to
[SPEAKER_01]: further benefit large scale soil
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have, uh, even more speakers that
we haven't announced yet that we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to trickle out, um, uh, to, you know,
release a little bit more hype as we get a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit closer to the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you could get any more
hype because that's got to be one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most well-rounded list of speakers I've
ever heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to give a little shout out to
our, our buddy, Josh.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a, he's a great guy and he's,
he's like yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing a lot to try to help promote
education in the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we all value that greatly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it goes without saying guys,
you got to get a ticket to this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got sold listening to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you need at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best part is it's free.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to host it on YouTube and
we'll have free product giveaways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, you know, with the virtual stuff,
it doesn't, you know, normally with a
[SPEAKER_01]: conference, it costs money to put the
conference on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to rent the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to rent chairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to rent, you know, all the
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to get hotel rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to, you know, it gets quite,
if you, I, if you would don't realize how
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive it can be to put on a
conference, it can be incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't have the funds to do
that, it can be really hard to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by having a virtual conference,
we don't really have a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: overhead to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're going to do is we have a
bunch of company sponsors, people like
[SPEAKER_01]: recharge, uh, true aquaponics,
grow more, a couple of other guys that are
[SPEAKER_01]: out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, what's the name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's another company that does a
fermented comfrey and some other stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, that, that all going to be donating
products that we'll have out there during
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that are all aquaponic safe or,
or, or, or fish based.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we're talking to a couple of other
people right now, uh, that, that we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: have out there and, and, and donate those
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just kind of promote the whole
education around aquaponic cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just sustainable cannabis,
not even just aquaponics, but we'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about how you can utilize some of
this methodology in your soil growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand that 70, 80, 90% of the
people that are watching this probably
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't doing aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to make sure that you're,
you know, you're, you're still gaining the
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge and things that you can take
away and apply to your soil grow that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that maybe you hadn't learned before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there you have it guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are now obliged to watch it's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: What more do you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that comfrey company you
mentioned might be casual fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a really, really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great product by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also aquaponic safe and a wonderful
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's another lovely guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one of the final things I wanted to
quickly ask you about before we get into
[SPEAKER_00]: the quick fire questions, you put up a
post, which just blew my mind and struck
[SPEAKER_00]: my curiosity like nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you did an episode recently on your
show with Kevin McKernan about how
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID-19 was found in cannabis tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is just wild, you know,
I guess the question is what implications
[SPEAKER_00]: do you think this has?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, the thing that jumped to mind for
me is it's like, do you need to be worried
[SPEAKER_00]: about getting COVID-19 from your plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so he, so, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to clarify something on that,
and this is something that I misunderstood
[SPEAKER_01]: when, when I read that paper and I read it
twice before I even interviewed him on
[SPEAKER_01]: that, um, he developed an allele to test
for the presence of, of, of COVID-19.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had an employee that sneezed on
the plant or coughed on the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: or if I'm a cannabis dispensary and we
allow them patients to smell the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: just before they purchase it, is there a
way to test for that using a q p c r?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what type of tests do you have to
have?
[SPEAKER_01]: What type of standard do you have to have?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he developed all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what he did on that was also develop
it for the inputs and what he found that
[SPEAKER_01]: was scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was really interesting,
if you listen to that episode was how
[SPEAKER_01]: insane the bat guano was and how many
different Corona viruses there were in the
[SPEAKER_01]: bat guano and how like it just scared the
living crap out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: and how we really need to all immediately
stop using bat guano completely in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry in terms of biosafety,
not only as a liability for ourselves as a
[SPEAKER_01]: company, for whoever you're working for,
but as an industry, because we could be at
[SPEAKER_01]: least accidentally, in theory,
the source of the next COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody wants that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that clarification.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still such an extremely valid point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been thinking something not too
different myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember I had a friend who got an
atypical pneumonia from handling guano
[SPEAKER_00]: last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, this isn't just something
you read about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a pretty gnarly experience when I
was younger with a pretty rare type of
[SPEAKER_01]: pneumonia as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they never figured out where it came
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes me wonder, because I was
often heavily in a gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now after listening to that,
it made me wonder, is that where it came
[SPEAKER_01]: from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there could be a whole range
of things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, thanks for clarifying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on to our quick fire questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really interested to hear your answers
for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one I'd like to start out
with, what's the most memorable cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: you've ever smoked in your life?
Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Memorable cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, the last joint I smoked with Dennis
Perrone at New Year's Eve, about two
[SPEAKER_01]: months before he passed away, would be one
of the ones that I can think of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll never forget that one ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the last time I saw him.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one was, and that was at the
castle on New Year's Eve, a Castro castle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone that knows the industry or knows
Dennis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other one would probably be,
there was one that I smoked with on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Dragonfly Earth medicine tent two years
ago at Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm trying to remember who gave it to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was a Wade laughter strain,
but I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: He handed me the ball and I think he's the
one who grew up, but don't quote me on
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was like a 16% something or other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just kicked me in the teeth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was just the most, most I've had
my bell rung in 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, that just stuck with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still, I don't even remember what the
name of it was, but I just, that one just
[SPEAKER_01]: hitting that, that pipe, you know,
just a regular glass bowl, two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: times, just kick my kick me in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I just did like three gram dab or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it just, the terpene profile was just
exactly what my body needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get that special hitter like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the other end of the spectrum,
has there ever been a strain where
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone else was really into it,
hyping it up and you're like, Oh cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you try it and you're like,
it's not for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I love this answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm such a diehard cookies fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I fucking love it, but I get how much
people hate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I never saw cookies again, it would be
too soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookies grows these little tiny larpy buds
that are just absolutely annoying as all
[SPEAKER_01]: hell for any of your trimmers to actually,
it doesn't produce nice fat stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all these tiny little, you know,
Superbowl stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Side bouncy ball size nugs that are,
you know, quarter size that are just a
[SPEAKER_01]: pain in the ass trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can certainly agree on that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't argue there for resin production
for concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get why people grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense, but I agree for me smoking
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it for me growing it a little less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question, if you were stuck on
a desert Island and you could only take
[SPEAKER_00]: three strains with you, which three would
you want to take?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be hash plant G 13, my blue hash
that I've been working on for quite a few
[SPEAKER_01]: years and Island sweet skunk by,
uh, or sweet skunk, not Island sweet,
[SPEAKER_01]: sweet skunk by breeder Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, great picks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just for the viewers, what,
what went into your blue hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's blue dream and the Afghan one,
um, and the hash plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the plant it was Afghan one and hash
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we crossed that and we got a really
fire male out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we crossed that with a blue dream cut
that we had that was really thick stocked,
[SPEAKER_01]: like freakishly thick stocked and just
kicked ass in the wind out in the plains
[SPEAKER_01]: in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was just, it would grow like into
like tree trunks, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would just hold itself up with fat
nugs, even in high winds, it would just
[SPEAKER_01]: take whatever you threw at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't, didn't really get broken at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we crossed those and the progeny from
that we've developed kind of two lineage
[SPEAKER_01]: that have since been just, we've gotten so
many different good crosses out of it that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've kind of, you can get, if anyone's
listening and wants some, you can get some
[SPEAKER_01]: through Mr. Green jeans garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you hit him up on Instagram,
uh, he does, does have them available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's one of the only source of the
actual original genetics that I have out
[SPEAKER_01]: there currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to hit him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the other end of the spectrum,
and this is one of my favorite questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you had to drop off someone,
you're not particularly a fan of,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you might even use the hate word
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone you're not a fan of, you got to
drop them off on an island and leave them
[SPEAKER_00]: with three strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to leave them with?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'd have to think on this for a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, blackberry cookies,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mac cookies, and what else has completely
no resistance to anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, citrus sap, the citrus, there's like a
citrus glue, citrus sap, fucking citrus
[SPEAKER_01]: gorilla glue cut that's going around
Oklahoma that just seems to get every
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen known to man as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The magnets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So final question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm interested to hear your answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could go back to any point in
history and go anywhere around the globe,
[SPEAKER_00]: presumably to collect some cannabis seeds
or a plant, where would you go and when?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably to Southern Africa, uh,
like South Africa, Swaziland or currently
[SPEAKER_01]: East Swatini.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just changed the name about a
year ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, uh, and Zimbabwe, that area has
some really, really bizarre genetics or
[SPEAKER_01]: reunion.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, take it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reunion Island, hands down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: One.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've often thought about myself with the,
the ever elusive psychedelic nature of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Zomale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that just about brings us to the
end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, thank you so much for
all the incredible education knowledge on
[SPEAKER_00]: aquaponics, KNF, IPM, organics,
just beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people wanted to check out your
podcast, what would be the best place for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to go find it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they can check me out at Potem Ponds
on YouTube, SoundCloud.
[SPEAKER_01]: iTunes, iHeartRadio, Spotify.

they can find us on whatever, whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: fits your most.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, uh, some of our episodes
definitely are more video heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have a tour of a glass
blowing facility and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably want to check out on YouTube,
but I would say 95% of them or 98% of them
[SPEAKER_01]: are perfectly fine to listen through them
in the audio version.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we get over 20 times listeners on the
audio version.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you're similar as well,
where you get, you know, significantly
[SPEAKER_01]: more listenership on your audio version in
the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's it guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just Google Potem Ponyx.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find it very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that being said, did you have any
comments or shout outs you wanted to make
[SPEAKER_00]: before we wrap up?

more information, check me out at,
