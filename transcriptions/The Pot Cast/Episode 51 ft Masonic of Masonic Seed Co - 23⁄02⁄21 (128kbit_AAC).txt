[SPEAKER_03]: So let's jump into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alrighty, so a big thank you and welcome

[SPEAKER_03]: on the block, Masonic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for inviting me, Platt.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem, my friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first question we love to ask all
guests, what are you currently smoking on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, you caught me on a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is some outdoor zirbert from 365
Canna Farms grown by Callie Kosher,
[SPEAKER_02]: sun grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not outdoor, sun grown is different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, it begs the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you more a fan of sun grown or indoor?
[SPEAKER_03]: Generally speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fan of good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time, most weed nowadays,
not most weed, but there's some good ass
[SPEAKER_01]: weed and I'm a fan of good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some good outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some good indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, easy does it for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you think that indoor will continue
to hold the kind of placeholder is the
[SPEAKER_03]: superior quality?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think that over time outdoor and
sun grown will become the more popular
[SPEAKER_03]: amongst the masses?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've yet to see an outdoor flower that
kind of just hits like an indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think there's always going to be a
spot for indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, on that note, it sounds like a
very sort of terpy strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: What sort of flavors do you find you're
more inclined to?
[SPEAKER_03]: You a gas guy, a fruity guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm a gas fruit guy for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's way more flavors than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's not like I can't choose both.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could choose both.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not too big on, you know, old world
turps like, you know, a brick or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I got to ask them because it
copped so much hate amongst the scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever tried or been impressed by
one of the more Amsterdam hazes,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the typical Jack sort of turps thing
or not your thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I came up on Jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 28 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that gives you how much, you know,
knowledge I got on weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a fucking baby compared to a lot of
fools that, you know, probably got 10,
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 years on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Jack is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fuck with Jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, if you fuck around, give me a Jack
cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll hit it to Wilson.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've smoked plenty of Jack and J1 and,
you know, super lemon haze and shit like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, it has its placeholder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not my preferred smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you raise an interesting topic that
I've been asking people about for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that in particularly the Bay Area and
even down to LA and whatnot, you get a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of people talking about how they're just
they're over the Jack turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just saturated for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what my perspective is, is that the
rest of the world isn't of that opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you find that's reflective in sort of
the demand for your seeds that those sorts
[SPEAKER_03]: of strains still do pretty well?
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to the seeds, man,
there's a demographic for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like you said, you know, like there
are people that love Jack, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to hit everything and cover
every every box.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you are right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I don't even know if you said that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people do.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a bigger calling for,
you know, gelatos and skittles and and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that runs has is like the
number one probably trending fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: strain amongst Instagram or whatever weed
avenue you're on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, these strains are good for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these strains that I name runs is
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gelato is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skittles is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm smoking a skittles derivative.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fucking yeah, man, I'm privy to
everything, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just I like stuff better than others.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, it's cool to hear that you're
you're so young and achieving what you
[SPEAKER_03]: are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the question that comes to mind for me
is that given you probably grew up when
[SPEAKER_03]: cookies was taking off, you were like
getting into the cannabis scene and
[SPEAKER_03]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your thoughts on cookies overall as
a strain?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you because a lot of the older folk
have this bit of a, you know, they're not
[SPEAKER_03]: so into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too new for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you feel like you love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookies is dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookies is nice, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ain't nothing wrong with cookies,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookies is dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookies has its namesake placeholder for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, fucking it's it's a good strain,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, on that same note,
you mentioned gelato, you mentioned
[SPEAKER_03]: skittles and runs.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your thoughts on runs?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like it stands up to gelato or
its derivative?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man, it's it's two different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried it from different people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've tried, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried gelato, I've grown gelato,
I've grown runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're two different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're both great, you know,
and then there's different gelatos,
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we can talk forty one,
thirty three, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, you asked the question for
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which of the gelatos are you most inclined
to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thirty three, I think, is a full
representation of all the gelatos.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm more inclined to the forty one for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I remember being at the Barbary
Dispensary a while back in San Fran and
[SPEAKER_03]: trying some of Schabinski's forty one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was so blown away by the potency,
like I really thought it was going to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: bit hypey.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember just looking at my friend
being like, dude, I am fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: People assume all rec weed is not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And generalizing in any aspect of life,
man, you're going to be in for a treat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're going to you're not going
to be open to new things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be in your same box
because you just everything is hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is mediocre.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing lives up to, you know,
your palate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people are like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I'll part to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, a point around July and runs
that I wanted to specifically ask you
[SPEAKER_03]: because I think you're a master of this is
that I feel like I like gelato more than
[SPEAKER_03]: runs, but it's undeniable that runs have
done a phenomenal job marketing the brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you excel in that in your own
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see it similar to the way I've just
put it or do you think it's a bit
[SPEAKER_03]: different?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man, you hit it on the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: They push their product, man, and that
helped shove it down people's throats,
[SPEAKER_02]: let alone solidify it as a namesake strain
in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people should take notes on that,
you know, fucking go make a song,
[SPEAKER_02]: go hire some dude that looks like Willy
Wonka to fucking rap for you, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking whatever you got to do and nothing
against, you know, young LB or any a fam
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they'll get your money, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking go feed your kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go make a legacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quit being a fucking a dude sitting at a
fucking table on your couch with a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of other 40 year olds talking about how
you could have did it better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I've certainly seen a few of
those conversations go down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it kind of segues nicely into the idea
of Berner and what he has and hasn't done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember watching a YouTube video from
you just a day or two ago, and you were
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, you know, a lot of people
criticize Berner.
[SPEAKER_03]: They say you give him too much props.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you were like, I think I kind of give
him the right amount of props.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it brings up this idea of like the
naysayers often hate the fact that he's
[SPEAKER_03]: not the breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I would always respond with,
but he did do stuff like you can't deny
[SPEAKER_03]: that he hyped it to the point where it is
what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your thoughts on Berner overall?
[SPEAKER_01]: Berner is a business person, you know what
I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's over there making sure he's good,
you know, and that's just people got to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand that in life that not
everything is a honeymoon, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's a good he sets the bar of what
you might be dealing with, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and whether it be good or bad,
you know, fucking I got nothing but nice
[SPEAKER_02]: things to say about people because,
you know, that's how that's how I am now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned to be nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out Big Berner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I feel you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a point that kind of helped me
to realize that exact sentiment you just
[SPEAKER_03]: expressed is I think it was Stickerfarm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put up a post and he said, whatever you
think about Berner, like he's paved the
[SPEAKER_03]: way for people to be able to feed their
family for years to come.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought that's actually a really
unique perspective on it, because he's
[SPEAKER_03]: created this empire kind of more so than
what anyone else has done around any other
[SPEAKER_03]: strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: He made jobs, point blank period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's exactly what you can say.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did it, make jobs, but like,
OK, he represents cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: People work at cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: He made jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easy does it for me, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's jump back to what we normally
ask people first, which is tell me about
[SPEAKER_03]: your first experience with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm from South Central Los Angeles,
so there's weed, you know, people smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: their weed out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like I'm from a conservative
area that is not accessible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was accessible growing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: My pops always told me he didn't want to
see me smoking that shit because he didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: see no future in it because of all the
stigma on it, you know, especially being
[SPEAKER_02]: in the hood.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got caught with weed, they're
probably going to throw you in jail real
[SPEAKER_02]: quick, you know, especially being a
Mexican, you know, fucking boom,
[SPEAKER_02]: boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so I was always scared of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got into eighth grade summer
going into ninth grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's when I found like my buddy
in an eighth grade had like a stem of some
[SPEAKER_02]: stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we call brickweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like showing it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, what's that smell like?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, oh, that's weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, oh, can you smell that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you bring me some tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just being a bad little kid, you know,
fucking eighth grader or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was an eighth grader and and
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't bring me none the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like we just smell the stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like my first encounter with
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just smelling the stem of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second encounter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hanging out with the skaters and we
end up in a garage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was I was a fat kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't even skate, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would literally run with chase the
skaters around running because I wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: be like hanging out with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I wanted to be part of the
skating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like a running behind these kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we end up in a garage and whatever one
of their older brothers lights up in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, dude, I ran out that motherfucker so
fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to go like this is scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, but I think finally ninth grade
came around and I got some weed from
[SPEAKER_02]: JaVante.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's one of my classmates and I went home
and I rolled it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there used to be a cold�actually Hold
a sack with like a dead end place where
[SPEAKER_02]: all the transients would sleep and in
South Central and I rolled it up in a
[SPEAKER_02]: joint but I didn't break it down and I lit
it up and The shit was just falling out to
[SPEAKER_02]: do like the nugs with the compressed nugs
would just fall out the joint and I'm like
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever You know, I gave it my best shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go back to and whatever that was a
failed attempt So I haven't got high at
[SPEAKER_02]: three times with weed Didn't get high with
the stem was too pussy to do it in the
[SPEAKER_02]: garage Did it wrong the third time four
time around they have some cat piss shake
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm like fuck it just give it to me
and I think I made like a I Forgot how I
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked it, but that's like the first time
I got high and I'm like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is it right here, buddy And ever
since then it's been you know weed weed
[SPEAKER_03]: boy Hell yeah, I mean that's so like I'm
so jealous that like your first proper
[SPEAKER_03]: experience getting really high was with
like cat piss I guess that's some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: perks of growing up where you did were you
aware of any other strains that were
[SPEAKER_03]: popular?
[SPEAKER_02]: around that Not completely oblivious to
anybody that smoked marijuana just like a
[SPEAKER_02]: little, you know conniving little kid Just
you know dwell my way, you know dove my
[SPEAKER_02]: way into that world and you know,
here we are today Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So was that the experience that kind of
solidified it for you that you were like
[SPEAKER_03]: hey I'm gonna be involved in this for a
good minute or Was there another one where
[SPEAKER_03]: you really like realized?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey cannabis is what I want to do with my
life As far as that that moment I realized
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to get high You know not all
the time little did I know it was gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: become all the time, you know Not that I
just want to get high all the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, yeah Yeah, so I didn't know
I was gonna grow weed or anything I just
[SPEAKER_03]: knew I was gonna be smoking it Sure and
What was the progression like from there
[SPEAKER_03]: to your first grow like?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many years went by and what kind of
inspired you to first kind of plant a seed
[SPEAKER_03]: or to grow one out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well for shits and giggles, you know in
high school I would you know grab a bag
[SPEAKER_02]: seed from any given stress and throw it in
the cup and put it in the backyard and
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch it grow a little bit Maybe every now
and then get a lollipop of bud and this is
[SPEAKER_02]: what what age are you in high school 9th
10th grade around that age?
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 11 12 no growing just smoking Lots of
smoke and 11 12 and then my parents are
[SPEAKER_02]: like this guy's just never gonna stop
smoking You know, like we gotta we gotta
[SPEAKER_02]: help him somehow, you know, so my dad he
had a buddy He was getting in he was
[SPEAKER_02]: coming becoming more liberal, you know
more open to marijuana He was he's also in
[SPEAKER_02]: car clubs, you know, it just so happens
dudes in lowrider car clubs some of them
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke weed So it's kind of like like dude,
you're over there kicking it with those
[SPEAKER_02]: weed smokers talking about I can't smoke
giving me a hard time so finally Like
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever dude, here's Ray.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grows weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gonna show you some stuff and we're
gonna help you So this is you know
[SPEAKER_02]: graduating, you know around graduation
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he buys me like some clones and like 10
like 15 gallon barrels and he fills them
[SPEAKER_02]: up with whatever they used to use a 50 50
miracle grow to steer maneuver like the
[SPEAKER_02]: hottest shit you can make on planet Earth,
but that's what they would use and
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever I'm like whatever dad like I just
want to smoke weed like the cool growing
[SPEAKER_02]: and And he's like, yeah, man, we're gonna
make it worthwhile and I just want to
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke the fucking weed But uh,
he ended up trying to grow it and rats ate
[SPEAKER_02]: it And then and then finally I'm like,
okay we moved to to Compton because we
[SPEAKER_02]: used to live like in South Central over
there by else and going over ma and I just
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like I'm smoking weed I had got a
pound of sour diesel that I'd Did it
[SPEAKER_02]: manage correctly and I was like back to
square one, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: graduated a little bit of college just
lost in the sauce don't know what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna do with myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a kid and I just started growing for
funsies and I would see my wife on
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram and I'm like I'm in the real
world, you know, I just graduated high
[SPEAKER_02]: school Never was on Instagram never was on
social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like baby like you're always on social
media like get off of there You're wasting
[SPEAKER_02]: your time and then I'm like, let me see
what that is This is about I start going
[SPEAKER_02]: and I start getting mused by everybody
that grows on there and I'm like what like
[SPEAKER_02]: There's strain names and there's this and
there's that all I know is you can go buy
[SPEAKER_02]: og cush You can go buy, you know blue
dream, whatever strains they have at the
[SPEAKER_02]: shop every now and then you get a clone
Don't know that there's a big,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know history and makers and like this
whole thing like everything that I know
[SPEAKER_02]: now none of that and Just picked up game
little by little to this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still soak up game like everything about
right I found that Shit out in less than
[SPEAKER_02]: 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I didn't know none of this shit I'm
just like boom fucking educated and like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the power of the internet and how
fast you get information Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: wow a lot of a lot of questions we can ask
there I just want to rewind back to how
[SPEAKER_03]: you mentioned your dad introduced you to
his friend Was he like did you consider
[SPEAKER_03]: the product he was producing at the time
to be good quality?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think he still was kind of
figuring things out himself?
[SPEAKER_02]: I I thought it was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't Like now that I look back it was
you know, not that great But like at that
[SPEAKER_02]: moment seen that much at any given time is
good I remember when you say like your
[SPEAKER_03]: first like ten pounds in one space.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, whoa It's all good Okay,
and was he just like sort of a hobby
[SPEAKER_03]: grower himself or did he have some
connections to some cool cuttings and
[SPEAKER_03]: whatnot?
[SPEAKER_03]: What were they messing with?
[SPEAKER_02]: I never dove that deep into who he knew as
far as What he was growing but he you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, he he he grew a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for motherfucking show hell,
yeah, so You are you kind of explained the
[SPEAKER_03]: mediums.
[SPEAKER_03]: What were the other aspects of the grow
going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like were they using just like HPS lights?
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the situation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, this is outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were doing outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is outdoor marijuana whatever indoor
they did I didn't dive into that to this
[SPEAKER_02]: day I've yet to like I have Go walk into
numerous grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had my own little four lighter that
you know didn't go as planned,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I you know used it to what I use it
for and You know fucking you've never seen
[SPEAKER_02]: like a picture of me like hey,
you know crushing my 20 lighter never ever
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's never happened, you know
Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So would you say that you like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Predominantly you like to work more
outdoors or it's just the experience you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, that's that's what I know I just
know how to grow outdoor Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of it nothing wrong with that Yeah,
so from that point was it mostly?
[SPEAKER_03]: This your father's friend who you were
kind of looking to for inspiration and
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge or were there any like bigger
breeders?
[SPEAKER_03]: You would become aware of and you were
like wow this person knows what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing Well, you know first it was you know
Ray my dad's buddy that you know taught me
[SPEAKER_02]: the the 50-50 formula and then I'd have
buddies come over and be like dude Miracle
[SPEAKER_02]: grows terrible like you're supposed to use
Fox farm, okay Fox farm, you know and then
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking hopped on Instagram and people
were like organic organic organic and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, whatever organic at that point I had
like Figured out how to use Fox farm and
[SPEAKER_02]: general hydroponics and shit like that
That's what I was using by the time I
[SPEAKER_02]: hopped on Instagram And then I go on
Instagram and they're doing organics and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was like this crew called summit dogs
They were using a nectar for the gods So I
[SPEAKER_02]: started using nectar for the gods and then
I started seeing this the K&F farmer dude
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, whoa, like that's like
wizardry dude, like you're over there
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking like what like What are you doing
with that milk?
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I dove into K&F and then I just
you know I went into a rabbit hole of that
[SPEAKER_02]: Ended up with Jadam Jadam said K&F was
trashed or that whole book in the trash
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm like, okay I'm just gonna stop
here go back to what I know and this
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping plants really green which is with
salts So now and and whatever I do salts,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I do it works now is basically what
I'm trying to say Sure, that that's a very
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting sort of progression You've had
through the various growth styles and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: cool to hear that you've tried both sides
Of the coin so to speak Overall,
[SPEAKER_03]: do you subscribe to the idea that a lot of
people do where it's that like organic is
[SPEAKER_03]: the best?
[SPEAKER_03]: And product you can get or do you think
you can do just as well with any sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I've had some really good organic
shit, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: But uh, the thing is I'm growing for seed
production so, you know if If if it was up
[SPEAKER_02]: to me, I'd bust it out organic,
you know fucking when you go eat fruit was
[SPEAKER_02]: better organic or Fucking the other one,
you know Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's an analogy that I often
fall back on to myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So From that point there What was it like
before you kind of became a breeder?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you spend some time just Fino hunting
things and figuring out the ropes and kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of collecting clones?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what was happening before you started
breeding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Breeding breeding was like fucking the
chocolate chip cookie for me man people
[SPEAKER_02]: People would see accidental pollinations
in my yard and Inquire on them and then
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like whoa, like fucking I should go
do an intentional one, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so that became the The Tropicana cherry
pie tangy male that I ended up giving to
[SPEAKER_02]: my buddy Warped he brought it back and I'm
still growing for you know cash crop or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever kind of blast it all into shatter
or whatever the case and not knowing that
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Creating a dope ass seed or he's
created a dope ass seed at his house but
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting half of them because I
provided the mill or whatever amount I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: getting and I put them off hookers right
for so as soon as I got them and
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's like dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want some it was agent orange Tropicana
cherry pie tangy and it was a plush berry
[SPEAKER_02]: Tropicana cherry pie tangy and people
inquired and and The demand was really
[SPEAKER_02]: high and fucking I'm like cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've been busting my ass forever
Growing all these, you know plants in the
[SPEAKER_02]: backyard not forever, but as long as I've
had Then and and it's high risk because I
[SPEAKER_02]: got to grow them as big as possible and
get as much as I can in the middle of
[SPEAKER_02]: Compton fucking and and cross my fingers
that I do it right, you know what I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: and You know fucking it just made sense to
start making seeds and establishing my
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds right then and there So I just did
it and my thing is like you got to do it
[SPEAKER_02]: before it's saturated You got to do it
before everybody else, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you got to do it point-blank period So
I just did it boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did the Tropicana cherry pie tangy I
fucking made my Homage all the way to
[SPEAKER_02]: chalice and and fucking in my mom's car
and it broke down on the way there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking Smoking and steam and I'm like
fuck this we're making it there we pull up
[SPEAKER_02]: and and and fucking I go say hi to Oni
because I'm already growing some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Tropicana the cherry pie tangy stuff was
was one of the first strains I had made
[SPEAKER_02]: for the Oni banner and I go and I mean Oni
and they're like you're fucking bat shit
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy Like what are you doing here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're poor is supposed to be in
Compton with your shitty plans or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, you know, and I'm like,
yeah Well, I'm here, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's like man here to have these seeds and
you know have this hash and I go home And
[SPEAKER_02]: it's the papaya fams like the first papaya
Availability one of the first papaya
[SPEAKER_02]: strains on the market and I grow those
Tropicana have to one of the first people
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow Tropicana have to which is also
one of the You know best strains cool
[SPEAKER_02]: right now to everybody likes it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I grow them And I hit up Oni or
Harry Palms at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was working with Oni and I'm like,
hey, man I got this male and these females
[SPEAKER_02]: out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like fucking put it to work and I'm
like hell yeah and fucking it's been a
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a rap since then Wow,
what a what a cool adventure the first
[SPEAKER_03]: thing that jumps to mind when you tell me
that is we had a lot of people message and
[SPEAKER_03]: ask what's your relationship with Oni like
because I think some people actually
[SPEAKER_03]: thought you were like Oni like just In
disguise or something?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no Oni Oni Oni seed company Oni
noodles That's a my mentor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I I learn a lot from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He he taught me to just You know He taught
me a lot of shit, you know a lot of ropes
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't got to do a lot of mistakes
because he tells me not to he's like not
[SPEAKER_02]: like stay away from them that's good and
it's always been a It's always been for
[SPEAKER_02]: the better for both of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's never been like I've never felt like
Like, you know if if I ever felt
[SPEAKER_02]: compromised I just leave I'm very cool
like that and fucking in this weed game I
[SPEAKER_02]: know people are like that everybody people
don't get along and I know people are
[SPEAKER_02]: shocked that we've been Getting along this
long Fucking people are like that's how
[SPEAKER_02]: you know people are supposed to break up
like now like, you know We know how to
[SPEAKER_03]: work, you know Yeah Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good to hear and I mean there's so
many things I want to ask you about that
[SPEAKER_03]: last little answer you had I mean you
touched on the papaya for a long time
[SPEAKER_03]: There was what I think is an incorrect
rumor going around that papaya was just a
[SPEAKER_03]: renamed green crack What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you heard this rumor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think my buddy Rasta that's in
jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a mean guy back in the day He was
under the moniker the Rasta.
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually started that rumor I believe
because I'm I'm I don't know like I'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: a self-proclaimed like I'm one of the
Probably original meme guys like when it
[SPEAKER_02]: comes to the weed memes like I'm the guy
you like, you know I'm one of them,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I even sound the Michael Jordan
of fucking memes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take it, you know, but uh Yeah,
he started that rumor Knowing that I was
[SPEAKER_02]: homies with Oni like just to like make fun
and he's like, haha Like I'm starting
[SPEAKER_02]: rumors, you know green crackers papaya And
like he'll send it to Oni and Oni would
[SPEAKER_02]: laugh about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody was in on it You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so and I know No, papaya is not
green crack papaya is actually a clone
[SPEAKER_02]: From I've overheard stories and I hate
asking them because you know, you you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, they say you look You you're
stupider if you don't ask but I stupider
[SPEAKER_02]: is not a word But you you're stupid if you
don't ask but I don't like to ask but I've
[SPEAKER_02]: asked before I've overheard someone ask
and the story goes that it's a cut from
[SPEAKER_02]: pink house in Colorado or some shit like
that that was that Harry Poms smoked and
[SPEAKER_02]: he Like I really need this and he brought
it to the masses be a cut, you know
[SPEAKER_02]: Reversing it and it's other things etc
Yeah, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: What what seed stock it's from I don't
fucking know, you know, and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's something I can easily ask those
fools But it's like papaya is papaya.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of that for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah sure good answer And I mean,
I guess it begs the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your thoughts on green crack?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also like blue dream a bit of a
Polarizing one Oh green crack blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything has its you know, it's place
and those shits are cool Like I've made a
[SPEAKER_02]: blue dream hybrid before I did blue dream
dose, you know, you know, and I'm Green
[SPEAKER_02]: crack should give me a green crack could
I'll slap that bitch right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know fucking let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to jump back a moment You were
talking about the first kind of strains
[SPEAKER_03]: you're playing with and they're a bit of a
mistake But they worked out being great
[SPEAKER_03]: and you mentioned that one of the mothers
Was agent orange the other was the plush
[SPEAKER_03]: berry I've for a long time been a fan of
TGA regardless of what you think about sub
[SPEAKER_03]: and all the rest I thought they put out
some pretty nice work.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your thoughts on TGA?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you like to grow their stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: I never grown any TGA that was grown by
warp genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did that pollination for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are his mom's but Fuck man dudes in
og fucking that's that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard some weird shit, but like who
cares?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean who cares that like like,
you know, show me the papers and then I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: care but you know Everything is hearsay
until I see it on paper for me because the
[SPEAKER_02]: internet, you know, don't don't hear
Everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean don't don't believe everything you
hear and shit Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that in mind, what was the you
know, we've heard about some of the stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: that was unintentionally made What was the
first cross you intentionally made and did
[SPEAKER_03]: it work out to work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well or didn't work out so well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah the first intentional crosses
where The papaya Femmes cross to Tropicana
[SPEAKER_02]: F2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was papaya punch Tropicana F2 Kato
cookies Tropicana F2 Banana og papaya
[SPEAKER_02]: Tropicana F2 which became my namesake,
you know flagship strain Wilson dosito
[SPEAKER_02]: papaya Tropicana F2 and One other one
three chem papaya Tropicana F2 and those
[SPEAKER_02]: worked out really well To the point where
Oni wanted them for his banner.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like hey, I was gonna do The banana
og trop hybrid for you know Oni and you
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you did it like can you not sell
them?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm all like yeah, man for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't sell them he's like better yet
like want to work together and I'm like
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking even better and That's you know,
you got a crawl and you got a you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though I say, you know Or you know,
I might say in a lot of words You know the
[SPEAKER_02]: code this unwritten code that people don't
think I respect I still have a general
[SPEAKER_02]: respect for it you know what I mean to the
point where early on in the game I asked
[SPEAKER_02]: now it's I'm at a point where it's just
I'm in my own lane now, you know fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: if I get a cut from From a breeder and
he's like, hey Respect it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's different because I got it
hand-to-hand with a breeder, you know now
[SPEAKER_02]: if I went and bought some seeds It's mine
now, you know Those are my seeds and and
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever I do with them fucking it
shouldn't it shouldn't affect you because
[SPEAKER_02]: you should be doing something different
anyways, you know Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean You just touched on a very
pertinent question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was gonna ask you a bit later on would
you say that generally speaking you Preach
[SPEAKER_03]: that sort of philosophy yourself in terms
of if someone buys your seeds They can
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of do with it what they want or do
you feel like it is kind of good manners?
[SPEAKER_03]: At least just to try to reach out and just
you know touch base sort of thing You can
[SPEAKER_02]: reach out but fucking don't be mad when
they say no So you is better if you kill
[SPEAKER_02]: first and then ask questions later,
you know, I'm fucking What are they gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking do?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean fucking you could get off Instagram
like oh You know, like people are crazy
[SPEAKER_02]: like that fucking it's not it shouldn't
bother you deep like that now if you have
[SPEAKER_02]: like a There's positions that you're in
like if you're just a random person it
[SPEAKER_02]: shouldn't you should be like dude Go
ahead, you know make more seed stock,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if it's a big person you should
play Hey, fuck you guy, you know kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: but like flattered because they're so big
they want to do it but it shouldn't mess
[SPEAKER_02]: with you and It shouldn't affect you,
you know, and and they should respect you
[SPEAKER_02]: enough Like you shouldn't make people mad
too, you know, cuz I will go after your
[SPEAKER_02]: shit and sell it for a penny You know
fucking shit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like It's just it's just there's
there's there's equations to everything,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, not everything is the same
answer So yes and no, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's yeah, you know fucking it's like like
for instance Capulator gave me a cut We
[SPEAKER_02]: did a project Don't release the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's cuz that's a that's like a
written formal contract now Hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, uh, I see you made a cross with my
things like you shouldn't be selling that
[SPEAKER_02]: that's different Like was there ever any
formal thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a disclaimer on your bag?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like where is your backup?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this some unwritten shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel threatened like you having a
bad day?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like is it shit like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: people that get grab testers and and and
make seeds with them I Could understand
[SPEAKER_02]: that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But uh, but also there has to be that that
that foreground like hey, these are
[SPEAKER_02]: testers They're for you to have an
opportunity Not to start a fucking seed
[SPEAKER_03]: company, you know Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's there's obviously a lot of nuance
in Varying different situations as to what
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of the approach the approach to take
it raises the question for me and you
[SPEAKER_03]: raise you raise Capulator himself I often
kind of scratch my head a little bit at
[SPEAKER_03]: How Cap gets a bit frustrated at how the
Mac one is, you know Everyone and his dogs
[SPEAKER_03]: able to get their hands on it these days
and he you know He harps on about how he
[SPEAKER_03]: was just meant to be given out to the OGs
and you deserve it and stuff But then I
[SPEAKER_03]: also think about Bodhi's sentiment where
he says look if you don't want something
[SPEAKER_03]: getting out You just shouldn't give it out
like What's your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think like if you give a clone to
someone it's inevitably gonna get out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man fucking that that that's that's
you know that's That might happen and the
[SPEAKER_02]: way I do it I just poke fun at the
situation and like the first time I met
[SPEAKER_02]: cap I was like how much like I think I
told him something like hey, like how much
[SPEAKER_02]: can I sell my Mac one for or something
like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just looked at me like you fucking
asshole And like that's that was like my
[SPEAKER_02]: way of breaking the ice, you know fucking
so Yeah, you know and and it kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: throws him off like like what the fuck guy
like, you know that I'm I get mad about
[SPEAKER_02]: this and you're over here like joking
about it, you know, so Fuckin yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just break the ice Yeah,
I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's definitely some humor to
be had in that situation So if we just
[SPEAKER_03]: rewind a little bit you mentioned that you
actually crossed a do-si-do mail I believe
[SPEAKER_03]: to blue dream in the past What's your
thoughts on do-si-do?
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it's a cool strain,
but it's also kind of fallen off a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit Did you find much success in that
mail?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh People love the blue dough man,
and it was a very small seed stock and
[SPEAKER_02]: People loved it to the point where I have
a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably like two years old already
now probably older Probably too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just love adding years to shit,
but it's just It's at least two years old
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows my buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maga cannabis Or whatever his name is he
sent me that cut and I hit it to Wilson
[SPEAKER_02]: again Not again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit it to my Wilson keeper, but and I've
had tons of flower of it hash Everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: that's grown it loves it, you know,
like I hate to fucking put cream on my
[SPEAKER_02]: taco But it's never been like hey this
blue dough sucks I've never gotten that
[SPEAKER_02]: response and very very you know,
it's probably like 50 to 100 packs It
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't that big of a drop but uh,
it was very successful Seeds drop and I
[SPEAKER_02]: put energy into it like we're talking
About marketing earlier like blue dough
[SPEAKER_02]: happened to be the only strain I had In
the making at the time so all my energy
[SPEAKER_02]: Marketing got put into that one strain as
opposed to now where I'm just like in full
[SPEAKER_02]: production And it's like everything times
Wilson so it's kind of hard to you know
[SPEAKER_02]: nitpick Which is like the one for you,
you know, so it's all like just go on the
[SPEAKER_02]: site now It's not like go on the site type
in your favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably crossed to Wilson.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I that's kind of the wave now
Sure a good answer and I think part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: reason why I brought that question up is
because You know, I really like all the
[SPEAKER_03]: Fletcher from archives work But sometimes
he does get a bit frustrated when people
[SPEAKER_03]: breed with do-si-do I it feels to me as
though he wants to have sort of Exclusive
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding with males from that one Did you
did you find any issues with that from him
[SPEAKER_03]: or anything like that or it was all bueno?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean fucking I know I'm I know for a
fact he knows who I am fucking everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: knows who the fuck I am But uh when I did
that shit, I don't fucking know who who
[SPEAKER_02]: made that shit I was just grabbing
do-si-do hitting it the blue dream like
[SPEAKER_02]: that's how Oblivious I can be to you know
the game the players Etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm just out here having fun fucking
the Fletcher to hit me up what I'm like
[SPEAKER_02]: who was happening Fuck it to this day is
all like I'm not here to make anybody mad
[SPEAKER_02]: and at this point They shouldn't make me
mad either fucking we're all human dude
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking you don't like something to shut
the fuck up stand your corner Leave me
[SPEAKER_03]: alone sure and something about the
do-si-do which a few other breeders have
[SPEAKER_03]: done with other strains is that There's
like different releases where there's
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know The number four the number
22 the number 18 like all these different
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of variations on it Do you think you
would ever do a project like that with
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe Wilson where there's like these
different sort of brothers and sisters
[SPEAKER_03]: using the breeding or you just Like to
stick with the keeper Now this that's what
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually right now I'm popping like
fucking 200 Wilson seeds and I'm gonna do
[SPEAKER_02]: that and I have my Wilson keeper male
around and you know, we're just gonna have
[SPEAKER_02]: some We're gonna make all the 40 year olds
and up happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it and out of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember which of the do-si-do
variants you used in the blue dough?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pollen gifted from my buddy turk
factory that he found he sent it from
[SPEAKER_03]: college Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so you mentioned it earlier But I'll
get you to repeat it because the question
[SPEAKER_03]: we got more than any other question from
the fans was What is the genetics of
[SPEAKER_03]: Wilson?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people thought it was just a trop F2
some people said banana papaya trop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you iron it out for them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wilson F1 that I made for Oni seed company
is Banana og papaya from fem seed stock
[SPEAKER_02]: that I found Times Tropicana F2 people get
it confused with Wilson zero Which is Oni
[SPEAKER_02]: noodles Oni seed companies interpretation
of you know, almost the same strain but
[SPEAKER_02]: with his selection of Banana og papaya
from female seed stock hit to his
[SPEAKER_02]: Tropicana F1 That is his flagship male
used in you know, almost every strain till
[SPEAKER_01]: recently He's been using different males
Cool cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what sort of like flavors and
structures can people expect Wilson to
[SPEAKER_03]: bring to crosses?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man I'd like to say it just Brings hash to
product, you know, everything seems to
[SPEAKER_02]: wash a little better with some Wilson in
there But I've never got like a scientist
[SPEAKER_02]: or anybody to take data like oh like this
is pre-washed With Wilson, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is the mom that you hit pre Wilson
and this isn't like we got numbers for
[SPEAKER_02]: you, buddy but uh What I do get from
Wilson is fucking uh, it's just continuing
[SPEAKER_02]: like lineage like isolating a clone
Terpian profile times Wilson getting a
[SPEAKER_02]: derivative of anything and and the easiest
form as opposed to sitting cuts You know
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping cuts like you can have a big-ass
fucking Bag of seeds with the flavor in
[SPEAKER_02]: there, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: and and it's easy to give it to people as
opposed to a mom that you got to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: clean and You know, hopefully it makes it
across the country because it's not gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: make it to fucking Spain or wherever it's
just that's what I do and that's what
[SPEAKER_02]: Wilson does Wilson is my boy that fucks
everybody and Allows me to get seeds of it
[SPEAKER_02]: and it just so happens that People are you
know happy with the seeds no matter what
[SPEAKER_02]: the progeny of it Fucking I just say hey
man It makes it hash more because you know
[SPEAKER_02]: probably does and that's what people are
telling me Wilson washes itself It hits
[SPEAKER_02]: like five six any given fucking pinot So
from the seed like you just grab a seed
[SPEAKER_02]: throw it in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna get some hash with Wilson So
we'll say it brings that it brings
[SPEAKER_02]: sexiness to the plant so you can grab a
land race like Malawi or something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that and hit it to Wilson and now you got
you know, not fully blown purple weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know Purple hues, you know
undertones of purple which is brings that
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so it does it does some shit for
the plant You know bag appeal,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know hash That's what it does Lovely
and I mean we'll touch on some concentrate
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff later.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just love to ask you quickly What was
the creation of Wilson like like where did
[SPEAKER_03]: the name come from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you watching cast away or how did it
come about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm not too big on name and strains
That's the thing only named them Banana og
[SPEAKER_02]: papaya is called cast away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I Crossed cast away to Tropicana f2
that ended up becoming Wilson like a play
[SPEAKER_02]: on you know already, you know cast away So
that's how that became that and it turned
[SPEAKER_02]: into fucking this whole thing,
you know And it's still relevant with you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, Tom Hanks getting coronavirus as
soon as you know the shit head and it just
[SPEAKER_02]: so happens he yells Wilson Out in the
fucking movies is just it's perfect time
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything happens for a reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what was the decision like to breed
with the male?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you Fino hunt the seeds first and find
a killer female and you were like damn I
[SPEAKER_03]: gotta find a male of this or how did it
go?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So out of all of them out of all the
females Like Wilson was you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the one that was different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was something untapped, you know papaya
punch smelled too much like you know
[SPEAKER_02]: Either papaya or was too punchy the three
cam Papaya was just too much papaya the
[SPEAKER_02]: dosito and the Kato They just weren't as
good as the Wilson.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that left the Wilson and I went and we
had a festival in San Francisco and we all
[SPEAKER_02]: sat down and I had made these crosses No,
I hadn't made these crosses but I had went
[SPEAKER_02]: back home and they're like, hey,
dude No, we were in San Francisco and made
[SPEAKER_02]: these crosses and they're like you got to
pick one, you know like to be The one and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, well shit, I'm growing a bunch
of them at the house right now I got like
[SPEAKER_02]: at least 30 of each growing right now of
those five strains and I'm like They're
[SPEAKER_02]: like the Wilson's the one and I'm like,
yeah, the Wilson's the one and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: well shit I got a bunch of males of them
and I'm gonna go through them and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, that's how you know We started
hitting everything with Wilson and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: how Wilson became the go-to, you know
strain and fucking it worked out Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was talked about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was talked About it wasn't spontaneous.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did sit down and We did, you know
brainstorm it like, you know go home we
[SPEAKER_02]: being Oni noodles and Harry Palms was at
the table that day when he was working
[SPEAKER_02]: with Oni and You're gonna go home and
you're gonna get a Wilson and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's gonna be your namesake,
you know and fucking Here we are today
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, and you mentioned earlier that Oni's
version of Wilson the Wilson zero is using
[SPEAKER_03]: their selection Different males and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever kind of compared them side
by side?
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you think they're more similar than
different or they're quite different
[SPEAKER_03]: because the selections just differ?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they're different man Oni's TROP F1 it
really The progeny of it is is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know completely, you know It just
stands out compared to you know My TROP
[SPEAKER_02]: F2, you know, so it's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different weed different selection
different weed Sure, sure and something
[SPEAKER_03]: you mentioned earlier, which I think is a
hugely relevant point is that You've got
[SPEAKER_03]: to like get the project made and out there
before the time comes and goes and that
[SPEAKER_03]: was something he referenced in regards to
that TROP cherry pie tangy male What I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: interested to know is it seems like the
Wilson is come at a very opportune time
[SPEAKER_03]: like that sort of flavor profile it has is
big at the moment and it's not like You
[SPEAKER_03]: know because some breeders will realize
something's big and then try To get that
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of cross done and then by the time
it's out there at market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's come and gone What's your
thoughts on the current flavor situation
[SPEAKER_03]: within the scene?
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you have any predictions for what
might be the next big flavor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man People I think people were going
back to the the the wheel which is oh geez
[SPEAKER_02]: You know people are going back to the shit
that worked, you know, not so much R&D no
[SPEAKER_02]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still the R&D but uh, I mean me
personally I'm going back to I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: find you know the the markers or as far as
we can get into the markers But you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: sadly you got to hit a Matt, right to get
the real deal So I'm I'm in for a treat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I'm ever gonna get any real
plants Look we're gonna have to have a
[SPEAKER_03]: chat about right But we'll we'll defer
that for a moment because I wanted to ask
[SPEAKER_03]: you a little more about some flavor stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd be interested to Know now now that
you're a bit more established and as you
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned earlier, a lot of people are
familiar with your work Are there any
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders outside of ones?
[SPEAKER_03]: You've already collabed with that you
think are doing cool work and you might
[SPEAKER_03]: want to do a project with them
[SPEAKER_02]: I Mean as far as doing a project with
anybody I Don't like to ask too much for
[SPEAKER_02]: help.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of like I kind of see like
hey That's like me asking for something
[SPEAKER_02]: almost so I've never asked for anything
every project I've done has either been a
[SPEAKER_02]: forced collab or The big homie looking out
for me, you know so Like right now I got a
[SPEAKER_02]: sure Binsky hit me up to the the other
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna do a collab Cap already.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already did a collab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the works He just popped the seeds
that I made in my yard with his male.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean with his a female in my mail But
who would I want to do a collab with
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do collabs with all my friends You know
to you know, help them, you know make more
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and just be part of the machine But
I would like to meet all the OGs,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know and and pick their brain and let
me You know just hang out with them or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But whoever OG it is, you know fucking
hey, what's up, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: What you got?
[SPEAKER_02]: What you working with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I did this I did That you know,
fuck this guy fuck that guy cool doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: work, you know Yeah, so you mentioned the
term forced collab is that sort of like a
[SPEAKER_03]: thing where?
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone's a bit upset with a cross you're
making and so to kind of you know calm the
[SPEAKER_03]: waters It turns into a collab or what did
you mean by that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh that just means I just you know Fucking
just do the collab with out any consent
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of a kill now ask questions later
thing like hey, man I popped all your
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds and I crossed on the Wilson Forced
collab I love that Force from the other
[SPEAKER_03]: side of what I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's cool So what would be your
advice for sort of a newbie breeder?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like someone who's looking to get a bit
more notoriety.
[SPEAKER_03]: How should they go about doing things?
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you learned?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Man notoriety, man, just be be be be
cool man be cool, man If fucking if you
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you got to use your platform.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you got to talk to people At
least I think you do I mean you so you got
[SPEAKER_02]: to be kind of you know, you got to have
good communication skills Can be fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: an introvert you got to got to put out a
little bit Give them a little bit of taste
[SPEAKER_02]: of your work your life, but I mean,
maybe you don't maybe I'm wrong But that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kept kept it cool kept it real Keep
it honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I don't know the shit don't lie about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't got to come up with any story as I
go just Keep it 100 man Sure, and I think
[SPEAKER_03]: you know that was a bit of a segue
question in terms of I think that you've
[SPEAKER_03]: done very well on Instagram in terms of
building a following Getting people to be
[SPEAKER_03]: aware of the brand and the crosses Do you
think it's possible for a sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: fledgling breeder to be able to succeed in
the current landscape without being?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of active on a social media or
Instagram Yeah, someone asked that last
[SPEAKER_02]: time they're like what work like what
would you be using if it was an Instagram?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'd there'd be another form there'd
be another place, you know, it'd be
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube it'd be Facebook it'd be Any given
form fuck it'd be word of mouth However,
[SPEAKER_02]: you got to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I you know, we're not before I was
reading, you know making seeds whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to call it I was backpacking the
weed I grew in my backyard From shop to
[SPEAKER_02]: shop, you know selling that so,
you know fucking that's what you'd end up
[SPEAKER_02]: doing but it wouldn't be as successful I
think because you know just so happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of motherfuckers on
Instagram It's easy to use as
[SPEAKER_02]: user-friendly and it's easy to you know
Get that message across on here as opposed
[SPEAKER_02]: to going on a whole ass form Not not
user-friendly not being able to put a face
[SPEAKER_02]: to a product Facebook couple channels.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the most Convenient thing for
people when it comes to weed like that
[SPEAKER_03]: sure and I guess an extension of that
would be that I feel like you're You're
[SPEAKER_03]: quite a polarizing figure to some people
on Instagram I think most of the people I
[SPEAKER_03]: talked to really enjoy your content and
the memes There are obviously some who are
[SPEAKER_03]: not so into it Why do you think people
view you as a polarizing figure?
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you think that it's a case of just
any publicities good publicity?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, not even that any any publicity
Like I would I don't want to be known as
[SPEAKER_02]: There's people that think that's the case
and they're like just doing terrible like
[SPEAKER_02]: dude all the publicity you're getting this
fucking terrible Like that's not the case,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so with me I think they just
relate to like he's I can do that too You
[SPEAKER_02]: know he from the bottom to the top,
you know fucking people's if they see me
[SPEAKER_02]: grow the foundation they're like They're
like what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know where what's like the trick,
you know, and and the trick is just just
[SPEAKER_02]: you know stay grounded keep your job build
your dream and You know, hopefully cross
[SPEAKER_02]: your fingers and that you did your dream
writing you built it up, right work hard,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course But that's all that cliche shit
that Gary Vee could tell you in any given
[SPEAKER_03]: video So you referenced earlier that you
know, you're you're the meme Guy,
[SPEAKER_03]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did this come about?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, were you always sort of like a
jokester sort of guy growing up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up on 4chan, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go To go visit my brother in
college and he went to UC Santa Cruz and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know there they would nerd out his
buddies and they would be on 4chan and I
[SPEAKER_02]: just thought it was the edgiest shit in
the world and I kind of just Would lurk
[SPEAKER_02]: every day every now and then I go on there
and I've just been aware of memes longer
[SPEAKER_02]: than most people have so, you know,
I got 10,000 hours of memes on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like It's fucking I'm the fucking
outlier when it comes to that shit There
[SPEAKER_03]: you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've uh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You've mastered it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You put in your 10,000 hours Yeah,
straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's facts G.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess the question is do memes sell
packs or do you think they just Grab
[SPEAKER_03]: people's attention enough so they can then
push Elon Musk said it the best G Memes
[SPEAKER_03]: control the world or some shit like that
It certainly feels like it's the zeitgeist
[SPEAKER_03]: and that like people respond to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely Yeah, my wife was talking to me
in the car the other day that people were
[SPEAKER_02]: older They're gonna be looking at memes
like a piece of art like oh this meme Came
[SPEAKER_02]: out like the dong the black Dude with the
dong, you know in Corona or whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: happened like they're gonna bring that up
on a screen in a college and they're gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: be talking about it They're gonna be like,
oh, you know the great meme of the
[SPEAKER_02]: coronavirus epidemic and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's art Yeah, it will be very interesting
to see how it's all analyzed and broken
[SPEAKER_03]: down in like sociology classes in 20 years
from now That's that's pretty hilarious
[SPEAKER_03]: actually So you referenced in a prior
answer A little while ago that should be
[SPEAKER_03]: in skis been hitting you up to do some
stuff What sort of stuff would you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe work with him?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're using one of the gelato cuts
or what do you have in mind?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean for starters I respect Everybody,
you know, that's how I saw it goes and
[SPEAKER_02]: unless they're not respectable people and
he hit me up because he sees I roll and he
[SPEAKER_02]: respects it and I've never Disrespected
him and if I have I've owned up to it
[SPEAKER_02]: because you know, I can be a little
disrespectful here and there and He's
[SPEAKER_02]: like, I like the way you roll,
you know, you and I think it'd be a great
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity for us to work together and
I'm like Fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're fucking sure Binsky man People who
fucking probably would say they don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: to work with you and end up working with
you anyways Because they're fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: weirdos like that, but I'm not a weirdo
and I'm like let's fucking work man And
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, hopefully we get this shit
cracked Oh, yeah, so, you know another
[SPEAKER_03]: good segue in that you've got your own
store in the works in Fairfax just down
[SPEAKER_03]: the road from chavinsky's store What's
that journey been like to being able to
[SPEAKER_03]: get your own store?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it just a dream?
[SPEAKER_03]: You never thought you'd be able to do or
was it just always the end goal from day
[SPEAKER_03]: one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Man fucking who knew man who fucking
knew?
[SPEAKER_02]: First t-shirts I made were at the same
place I made This one and it's just like
[SPEAKER_02]: the the dude at the swap meet that will
whip up a shirt for you for 20 bucks So,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I would like on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, hey guys like I got my cool
little logo You know that the guy my homie
[SPEAKER_02]: sent me like who wants a shirt of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'll take one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take one, you know, and then it
became oh I made a box of tees and they
[SPEAKER_02]: come with free seats It were however you
want to look at it free seats free tee
[SPEAKER_02]: free tee free seats However, the fuck you
want to look at it and it just so happens
[SPEAKER_02]: the design is dope like something you'd go
And buy at fucking a store, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it's like you get seeds and a dope tee
fuck Yeah, and it turned into a monster
[SPEAKER_02]: turned into me fucking getting boxes of
t-shirts Let alone trying to find a
[SPEAKER_02]: storefront Finding a storefront on fucking
Fairfax let alone so it all just kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: just happened man There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, do you feel like you've
quite made it so to speak at this point?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm broke as fuck man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ain't got shit for I got no property
when I'm on a beachside You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: my buddies driving me on a helicopter from
place to place I could go have a business
[SPEAKER_02]: meeting and then be able to home and sleep
at night and my fucking house in Calabasas
[SPEAKER_02]: or some shit like that That's when you
made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But man, I'm I'm fucking I'm still trying
to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gee.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't make shit That's all people see
what they want to see and that's all I let
[SPEAKER_02]: them see man They only see they don't see
my wife throwing a Fucking control at me
[SPEAKER_02]: across the house, you know, they only see
you know, my wife handing me this t-shirt
[SPEAKER_02]: all nicely You know, it's like Yeah,
okay, I mean that raises a really
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting point Do you feel like there
is just like all this sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: behind-the-scene works?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which people often kind of discredit
because Instagram often, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it doesn't really show that a lot of the
time There's some shitty people out there
[SPEAKER_02]: that don't want their shitty lives on
Instagram like they made shitty decisions
[SPEAKER_02]: in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: I own up to anything I do so I'm very open
about everything like I'm an ugly
[SPEAKER_02]: motherfucker So what you know show the
ugliness but try to make it look good,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know And I'm very open like people
could fucking tell you like what I did
[SPEAKER_02]: today Because I'll be fucking cracking on
my phone all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like it's weird like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to Figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a balance to everything I I do
hide the shit He should of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna tell you like like if
someone's doing adultery you think they're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna be like, oh man Fucking my wife
caught me cheating today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's gonna be a terrible week The
seeds are the plants are gonna look bad
[SPEAKER_02]: like nobody's and if they do they're just
fucking crazy Keep that shit to yourself,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know Yeah, of course of course So just
to jump back to what you mentioned earlier
[SPEAKER_03]: about how you know You were doing the buy
a shirt get some seeds or get get the
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds get a free shirt however you want to
look at it I've noticed that you have got
[SPEAKER_03]: to be the king of like the insane promos
And I think that the the thing which like
[SPEAKER_03]: really piqued my interest in that is you
were doing like 15 packs for like 450
[SPEAKER_03]: bucks or something like that I think
you're doing even better deals than that
[SPEAKER_03]: at the moment Do you feel like this is a
really good way to get your work out there
[SPEAKER_03]: and to have people repping your brand?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think you're just trying to be
good to the customer?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's both G these dudes You know,
whatever they want to make it like Like
[SPEAKER_02]: it's fucking the holy grail, you know,
like dude you have a five gallon bucket of
[SPEAKER_02]: those fucking seeds Like do you not want
people to have them, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like like you like there's ways of doing
things, you know, and I and I've managed
[SPEAKER_02]: to Figure it out how to do it my way
people think it's like they're whoring out
[SPEAKER_02]: their strain, you know Well, isn't that
what you want kind of you want everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: to try your perspective?
[SPEAKER_02]: No only these select people at this Select
price, you know and there are strains that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can allocate towards that price
because you put more work into them etc Or
[SPEAKER_02]: or there was only so many of them so you
can do whatever you it's your fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: product you can price it at whatever you
want and Some people do better than
[SPEAKER_03]: others, you know Sure, and I mean it
raises the question Do you feel like what
[SPEAKER_03]: you're doing might help bring a new sort
of era of pricing for seeds and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: like gone is The days of you know,
the hundred fifty dollar pack sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: thing It is man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody Not everybody but I've had seed
makers sellers, whatever you want to call
[SPEAKER_02]: them hit me up and be like dude That is
your fucking crazy It was 15 for 300 at
[SPEAKER_02]: one point and I would let them pick the 15
packs from a fucking extensive list and
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like would it like and I had the
five for 100 So if you didn't have three
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred dollars to cough up you can get
five packs, but those would be dealers
[SPEAKER_02]: choices You wouldn't be able to pick them
from a cohesive list.
[SPEAKER_02]: But uh today I still have that except the
the 15 for 450 is Is a different tier and
[SPEAKER_02]: you whatever I sound like I'm selling the
shit now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what I want to do We're talking
about how we're driving the price down I
[SPEAKER_02]: think they it's just you got more work to
do now, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you got to have somebody bag and tag
for you now you got to really you know put
[SPEAKER_02]: your fucking boots on strap up because you
know here comes fucking Masonic and he has
[SPEAKER_02]: five gallon buckets of every strain he's
ever made and It's fucking he can give
[SPEAKER_02]: them away all fucking day for a whole
month if he wants and then and then
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking sell them again It's like it's a I
gave away more seeds than I've sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for fucking sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And five for 100 that's what like 50 60
seeds or some shit like that is that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: too many seeds, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people don't have all the space,
but we're in a different time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in a different area area People have
to grow very secluded very secretive back
[SPEAKER_02]: in the days access to genetics and all
that shit, you know, there was it was
[SPEAKER_02]: harder now it's it's the future and and
You know, we move a little faster like the
[SPEAKER_02]: internet, you know information goes fast
Everything's faster now, let alone my seed
[SPEAKER_03]: production method and how the cells go
Yeah, I mean so much to go into there I
[SPEAKER_03]: guess the first thing I quickly ask about
is your seed production method is on the
[SPEAKER_03]: surface when I was looking at just Your
output is insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's just new crosses dropping
left right and center Do you do this by
[SPEAKER_03]: having a few different sites and kind of
staggering things or do you make them all
[SPEAKER_03]: at once?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just slowly trickle them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it seems as though new stuff's always
being made.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your approach to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what I did this season I just kept
the male and I just kept bringing out
[SPEAKER_02]: males any given week from my big male or
or I you know, let alone Brought out the
[SPEAKER_02]: big male at the very end or in the middle
pollinated him and kept the cuts So it's
[SPEAKER_02]: all like there was always pollen around
pretty much There's always a tower of
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen hitting everything whether it be a
cut this big one that grew out a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit more You know the male that I you know
the whole dad that I had and I just
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking flipped the whole thing and just
You know just on everything and just
[SPEAKER_02]: called it a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's it's keeping stages of him
keeping towers of him all spaced out
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout wherever the And you also
mentioned that you've probably given away
[SPEAKER_03]: more seeds than you've sold I remember in
a prior episode Bodhi spoke about how this
[SPEAKER_03]: is just sort of like a good act to do in
general it's kind of like helping the
[SPEAKER_03]: scene out by giving people seeds obviously
it helps promote you because Although not
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone's gonna test the seeds you give
them some will and some will post photos
[SPEAKER_03]: and it'll help to get you a bit more sort
of notoriety amongst people Do you
[SPEAKER_03]: subscribe to that idea?
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you think that when a breed is sort
of starting out they should?
[SPEAKER_03]: Give some seeds away and not just be
trying to sell everything from day one
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's that's uh, I actually that's
some game right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some real game actually,
uh Dude you you when you make your first
[SPEAKER_02]: cross man And you think you're gonna just
straight me like uncle Scrooge or whoever
[SPEAKER_02]: the fuck and just you know fucking deep
diving into gold, bro You need to relax
[SPEAKER_02]: and just start giving shit away man You
just just give away half half of the seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: G you're gonna see they're gonna see other
people have them and they're gonna be like
[SPEAKER_02]: I want some too now you could sell them,
you know what I mean and is good karma
[SPEAKER_02]: points too, so I'm into mystical shit like
that, you know, I believe in positive out,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know output you and get some positive
shit back and ain't nothing wrong with you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, there's dudes out there that Got a
yard, but they think every seed pack cost
[SPEAKER_02]: $100, you know They're just cuz that's
what every seed pack cost until you know
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking people like me came around or been
around You know, I'm not too privy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there are people but they don't know
how to use the internet or they don't even
[SPEAKER_02]: know how to go through the avenue of going
it, you know, so uh Yeah, fucking give
[SPEAKER_02]: away your seeds and then start your shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's gonna help you a lot Hell yeah,
so I mean on that topic of making seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the next couple of Wilson?
[SPEAKER_03]: Crosses you want to make and are there any
sort of dream crosses where you like you
[SPEAKER_03]: just trying to get your hands on the
female But you're finding it hard to track
[SPEAKER_02]: down sort of thing, but you think it'll be
like a winner I'm not too I don't seek the
[SPEAKER_02]: strains too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not too like if there's a hot strain
on the market I'm not like oh man,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I need that it's gonna really help,
you know me build everything just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: falls in my lap I'm nice to a lot of
people and I give like I give and they
[SPEAKER_02]: give back and it just so happens a lot of
my buddies have some cool-ass cuts and I
[SPEAKER_02]: Happen to have a lot of them, you know,
they happen to fall in my lap.
[SPEAKER_02]: They happen to get
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinated Pollinations with them so it'll
be like a g41 that I didn't you know
[SPEAKER_02]: transplant and you know do full term or
something like that like like the Cuban
[SPEAKER_02]: black haze like even though I know it's
probably not gonna be my favorite strain I
[SPEAKER_02]: know a lot of people love it but so I want
to put it in their hands and You know make
[SPEAKER_02]: some money just so happens to be part of
that, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And people can be like, oh I do it for God
now motherfucker like you're doing this To
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, put some food on the table and
maybe go to Disneyland too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So quit that shit like, you know,
you know, you want to live nice,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know You don't want to fucking be
mediocre And if you do well fucking your
[SPEAKER_02]: ethical and you're cool and all power to
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean namaste, but uh fucking you know,
we're we're over here fucking You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're doing stuff for a reason,
you know And and the guys that are gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: get the Cuban black haze Wilson times
Wilson again They're gonna be stoked for
[SPEAKER_02]: that Shit, they're gonna like dude you
grab my favorite strain, but not only did
[SPEAKER_02]: you hit it to Wilson But you hit it twice
and and it's and it's cheap and I can get
[SPEAKER_02]: it, you know I don't got to go through you
know to this guy to get it because fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: it costs too much or whatever or it's
inaccessible like I'll make it accessible
[SPEAKER_02]: and That strain along with a bunch of
other strains that you know I'm stoked
[SPEAKER_02]: about like like the Mac Wilson the Mac
from cut Wilson I hit that small seed
[SPEAKER_02]: stock because Mac doesn't take well to
pollen So I'm gonna hopefully the hybrid
[SPEAKER_02]: of it does so I'm gonna hit it again No,
I see you read my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was about to ask with them with the Mac
Have you figured out any tips or tricks to
[SPEAKER_03]: getting it to make pollen or it's just a
luck sort of thing Well to take pollen to
[SPEAKER_02]: take pollen the cut I just hit it man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just hit it from from the badge to finish
it cross your fingers that you get enough
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's literally what I did and
and and literally And and I'd be like
[SPEAKER_02]: bullshit like capture saying that to deter
people from hitting it, you know Like he's
[SPEAKER_02]: just telling you it don't take but now
like that should don't take well gee It
[SPEAKER_02]: really doesn't take well to pollen and it
don't want to give you seed and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of cool cuz like you know that that's
like one one step or red tape from people
[SPEAKER_02]: pouring out his his His you know his baby
Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean I like to ask all guesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your thought on the Mac?
[SPEAKER_03]: Flower and concentrate itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a fan?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bit of a polarizing strain in its
own, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I Mean, I've been to piece of green a
couple times and I pick up Mac caps cut to
[SPEAKER_02]: this day My buddy dog man was here the
other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: He washed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's its own thing, man It's just dope Max
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not one to hate on any strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just some are better than others It's
like man, you hate weed like come on dog
[SPEAKER_02]: chill out, you know, I don't hate anything
to hate Or dislike like I just don't like
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't necessarily dislike it I'd like it
less Yeah, I feel yeah, and I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: speaking just referencing earlier I was
watching some of your YouTube videos and
[SPEAKER_03]: you were testing like the snowman from the
cookies crew powers up and the London
[SPEAKER_03]: pound cake These strains cop a lot of hate
not necessarily because the people have
[SPEAKER_03]: tried them But just because they really
dislike the crew behind them What's your
[SPEAKER_03]: take on these strains?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like like some of these
strains which cop a bit of flack are
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty good?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like the stigma surrounding the
crew that made them or how do you feel
[SPEAKER_03]: about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quality control had a lot to do with
the stigma that was put on the strain now
[SPEAKER_02]: for instance Snowman when it was debuted
at Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some moldy badges So people were
gonna just put that you mentioned snowman
[SPEAKER_02]: moldy, you know, so stuff like that
doesn't Help and you know fucking you grow
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking a million acres or I don't know
how much they grow but and and fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna you look hard enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't find something but it's just
it's how you address things too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So uh This politics to everything,
you know The strains were good if they're
[SPEAKER_02]: good, they're good there was whatever when
I went to cookies burner called him and
[SPEAKER_02]: Had them help me while I was on the phone
with murder And he made sure I got all the
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there goes quality control like he made
sure Like his you know, that's smart on
[SPEAKER_02]: his behalf You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like if somebody went to your
house like not saying you sell weed but
[SPEAKER_02]: like say you sold weed and it just so
happened to be like somebody you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: be in good graces with and You there's
there's tears, you know, you're gonna call
[SPEAKER_02]: whoever's serving that dude and you'll be
like hey, man Give them the fucking the
[SPEAKER_02]: headstache, you know, like I want them to
go home and and give me a good bias So,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you can't blame them for that,
you know fucking there's there's there's
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a product for everybody not
everybody can Afford the fresh batch they
[SPEAKER_02]: got to get you know, the sun grown or
whatever So he made sure I got the good
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course he He was smart about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He made sure I went home and it just so
happens I was doing reviews at the time
[SPEAKER_02]: and he got good reviews because everything
I reviewed wasn't fucking terrible because
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, sometimes it's bad and you know,
and I and there's a complete hiatus on
[SPEAKER_02]: that up on that shit cuz It's just it's a
whole ass job man, you you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you do this shit So editing and all that
my wife does it I record it and I'm just
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just gonna stop Yeah, I feel ya so
something I've been personally wondering
[SPEAKER_03]: about the whole cookie situation is that
as you reference there was some issues
[SPEAKER_03]: with quality control with some of the
outdoor batches and it kind of raised this
[SPEAKER_03]: idea of like For a longest time cookies
was primarily an indoor only sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: company like they were selling indoor
flour It was good quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: It helped get the brand to where it is now
They're expanding outdoors and doing some
[SPEAKER_03]: sun grown stuff Do you feel like overall
that's beneficial because it's providing
[SPEAKER_03]: like different price points like some
cheaper more available stuff or do you
[SPEAKER_03]: feel like the potential issues with
quality control my overall just diminish
[SPEAKER_03]: from the brand as it is which Is kind of
got reputableness for being like high
[SPEAKER_02]: quality Man fuck that's that's that's a
very that that question has like ten
[SPEAKER_02]: answers to it probably but uh I've never
ran a big ship like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they probably have a Dude that
does analytics on that shit, you know
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking over there like dude like when we
put out, you know You know said batch from
[SPEAKER_02]: said skew, you know fucking sells went up
Above the roof and they just keep going
[SPEAKER_02]: above the roof.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're just like keep putting it out
that you know and and and And I know You
[SPEAKER_02]: know you you get to know people and you
see what goes on behind the scenes and
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my thing is all like just Fucking the
truth always prevails So if they're like
[SPEAKER_02]: doing some shady shit, like they know
they're doing it, you know, so hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not you know, who knows I know
that I got a personal call and he's all
[SPEAKER_02]: like hey man QC, but that wasn't me That
was somebody else or maybe it was me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked to him a couple times and I'm
just like, you know, whatever I don't like
[SPEAKER_02]: to dive into it cuz I'm not that's not my
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's a big-ass ship right there
You know, will it diminish the the brand?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so because they're they're
really really big and and Instagram is so
[SPEAKER_02]: small compared to the demographic that
they kind of cater to from what I see like
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody knows who you know gauge
green is and and like all these the
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders They just know that there's a
shiny bag and there's weed in it and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what everybody's smoking So they
want to smoke it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like a billboard,
you know, so that's what they are and And
[SPEAKER_02]: if there's good product in there,
then that's just extra.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean and Us we know The
smoke and mirrors but the the common
[SPEAKER_02]: Consumer is is is just getting a baggie
with stuff in there Yeah, I mean gosh what
[SPEAKER_03]: a what a great answer because there's so
many avenues we can go off in to me you
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of touch on this idea that's
prevalent at the moment and a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: growers really get frustrated by it is
among the just the average consumer,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the sort of hobby enthusiast
smoker the mylar culture seems to be very
[SPEAKER_03]: prevalent, you know this idea of just
anything in A mylar bag with good
[SPEAKER_03]: advertising is gonna sell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that frustrate you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like what's in the bag is more
important than the bag itself?
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you just think it's just marketing
like get with the game?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cutthroat row is cutthroat It's a
it's like it's like a dude that it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: hitting up the fake jungle boys account
and getting sold weed and you're like a
[SPEAKER_02]: they bamboozled me it's like That you see
what I'm getting that it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all like, you know What the fuck
you're getting into you're in you're in
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in Texas in the middle of nowhere
You think you're you're getting a real
[SPEAKER_02]: Gary Payden cookie bag for $40 like Just
like and and that's it's another thing is
[SPEAKER_02]: just you know educated and it can go as
far as remedial education You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: some dudes have a hard time reading
imagine how they are fucking trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out what weed they want You know
what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure so Do you think that this trend
will basically continue where some some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the things I've been told and observed is
that You know the quality of the weed can
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of take backseat to the good Mylar Do
you think that that's only really gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: fool the the kind of inexperienced or do
you think that trend will continue and
[SPEAKER_03]: weed might just go down a bit in quality
because the Mylar is flashy enough Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: man They're gonna keep they're gonna ring
it as as much as they can and and probably
[SPEAKER_02]: till till the end of time because there's
McDonald's and There's you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the best burgers in the world,
whatever you think that is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so there's there's always gonna be that
weed around and They're gonna give it to
[SPEAKER_02]: you in the best presentable package
possible and Mylar's just so happen to be
[SPEAKER_03]: the one Sure, and a question which I've
been pondering for a long time is in
[SPEAKER_03]: regards to last time I was in the States
which was about a year ago now I noticed
[SPEAKER_03]: that like a lot of the weed I was seeing
and being presented to me It looked really
[SPEAKER_03]: nice but a lot of it didn't smell or smoke
as good as it looked and it kind of is
[SPEAKER_03]: like in that same vein as the Mylar and
that like it's got the aesthetics but
[SPEAKER_03]: there's not a lot of substance behind it
and then someone said to me this thing
[SPEAKER_03]: which I thought was really quite profound
where they were like Yeah, like this this
[SPEAKER_03]: is what the demand is because on Instagram
you can't smell Bud's people post you
[SPEAKER_03]: can't smoke it but you can look at it and
if it looks good that post is gonna be
[SPEAKER_03]: popular Do you kind of see that trend
yourself and do you come across this sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of like weed that looks good?
[SPEAKER_03]: But isn't really quite packing the punch
you hoped yeah, man that that goes back to
[SPEAKER_02]: Organically grown shit, you know fucking
some weed might look terrible and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like the best shit ever so and and Yeah,
bag appeal does sell, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like that that hot girl does sell but she
doesn't cook Or do anything not that
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what ladies are supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like my partner, you know I want her
to be smart and shit, you know fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: some of them aren't some of them are the
whole package though, you know what I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean, so fucking Same thing with weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it just looks really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it you know, I don't know shit So do
you think that that trend with the average
[SPEAKER_03]: consumer will continue whereby Like people
are just looking for the most frosty thing
[SPEAKER_03]: and they don't actually really care about
the turps or the end effect Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's easier to punt to just pump shit with
HGV than it is to you know Put a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit more love into it, you know,
people are doing big classrooms teaching
[SPEAKER_02]: all these plants at the same time So
they're only gonna get so much love Sure
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess the next question which I
don't think I've asked anyone yet But it's
[SPEAKER_03]: got it it ties into all this and it's been
on my mind forever There's this you know
[SPEAKER_03]: amongst this same quarter sort of consumer
group.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about like the sort of
casual enthusiast The term exotic it's
[SPEAKER_03]: it's used to be like, you know,
that's the bees knees.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I want the exotic I realized
there's really no definition around what
[SPEAKER_00]: exotic is like what to you is exotic weed
exotic is what is exotic that's that's
[SPEAKER_02]: like a I Don't know man anything burner is
promoting is exotic, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like anything trending I think would be
like the right exotic definition even if
[SPEAKER_02]: it's I don't know but what if like
Acapulco gold is trending again.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's not exotic, you know,
so exotic is like you said That's just
[SPEAKER_03]: malarkey Yeah, so you feel like it's more
of a marketing term than something that
[SPEAKER_03]: actually has like a strict sort of
definition yeah, man, it's it's like I
[SPEAKER_02]: could come up with some shit like that
like Now, this is antique, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like we only smoke antique weed over here
Like it's kind of like that, you know
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go the old school and I mean
it's probably about as bad Good as the
[SPEAKER_03]: segue as I'll get as any antique You know
one of the favorite strains of the show
[SPEAKER_03]: and I try to bring it up in every episode
because it's so near And dear to my heart
[SPEAKER_03]: is the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's a bit of an antique strain in
its own, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your thoughts on the various chem
cuts and do you have a favorite?
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you ever want to breed with any of
them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit man, I'd be lying if I Told you I had
any of them, you know my first the first
[SPEAKER_02]: time I had chem Was from Skelly who works
with 710 labs and I went to his house and
[SPEAKER_02]: he gave me some chem 91 in hash form and
I'm all like, oh this is like GMO but you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, no, no GMO is like chem,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: so That was like my first time and I'm
just like cool like chem is GMO,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know Like that's like that's kind of
my interpretation because I had smoked GMO
[SPEAKER_02]: before I smoked chem because I'm fucking
new booty.
[SPEAKER_02]: So So I'm like So I bought like chem I
fell in love with chem right away because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like oh, you're the original one You
know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean to me, that's how I look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like oh like this is where it came from,
you know, so chem and then What other
[SPEAKER_02]: forms of chem have I had?
[SPEAKER_02]: I Don't know but that's like the first
time but I've had it a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_02]: times and chems dope man fucking chem dog
Has hit me up before too and he's a cool
[SPEAKER_02]: cat, you know I got the chem D I9 25
Wilson that I did that one's dope There's
[SPEAKER_02]: some cool shit in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that one was a hit every box they
grew like 600 different plants of every
[SPEAKER_02]: Wilson hybrid and That one was the best
one So yeah chem dog Wow lovely and I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: are there any other sort of I love the
term antique I'm gonna keep using that Are
[SPEAKER_03]: there any sort of other antique strains
that you're fond of and or would like to
[SPEAKER_03]: discover a bit more?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like things like, you know,
like hazes or skunks Yeah, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to Dive into the rabbit hole
of Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the first interpretation of Hayes
that I had was a it was called lighthouse
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the cross was called and it was
like nl5 times nl5 times nl5 I was like
[SPEAKER_02]: they just crossed nl5 a thousand times or
some shit and I'm like this is This is
[SPEAKER_02]: different, you know and like it grew on me
and then people would show me like Hayes
[SPEAKER_02]: interpretation They're derivatives and I
would have a marker for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Today it's it's still not solidified
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, there's other hazes and
shit So I want to I want to meet fools
[SPEAKER_02]: that have that like the homie was gonna
send me the a5 and the c5 or some shit I
[SPEAKER_02]: have no idea what these are but he's all
like these are the ones, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: or they're part of you know that great
legacy of people getting Hayes and then
[SPEAKER_02]: the other day I was gonna get some other
Hayes but only he's like no no,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do better with it than you And I'm
like, whatever dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not in a rush to go smoke Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go get it from him tomorrow anyways,
so yeah, man, I'm I'm I'm trying to become
[SPEAKER_02]: privy to The old books per se,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean like like anything like you you
want to go read the the first parts of the
[SPEAKER_02]: book So that just happens to be some of
the first strains that were out that I'm I
[SPEAKER_03]: want to get privy to everything So sure
and there's I mean, I'm sure you've seen
[SPEAKER_03]: posts and heard people talk about it,
but there's this Huge sort of collective
[SPEAKER_03]: push in the scene to find or to revive the
roadkill skunk What's your thoughts on
[SPEAKER_03]: this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it exists?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of starting to get to the point
where I actually doubt it's even around
[SPEAKER_03]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Man, I'm like like we were talking
earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm becoming aware of all this and I've
heard a the funny shit before like I even
[SPEAKER_02]: had a Like for some reason I ended up in
that ITC dudes ear and he went as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to my booth and showing me his
roadkill skunk and I'm like, I don't even
[SPEAKER_02]: know you like that G Like what are you
doing here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he's like, oh, I just want to make
sure we didn't have no beef like and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: like dude We got no fucking beef.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got beef with nobody and he's like,
yeah, man I heard like people were tagging
[SPEAKER_02]: me in post making fun of him So it looked
like I was part of the the the ordeal
[SPEAKER_02]: because people would just assume I just
make fun of anybody But that's not my
[SPEAKER_02]: quarrel, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But like That wasn't cool either like
dude, like what are you doing here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Get away and and and that's it,
you know, like not even right now I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: even talking trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just that's just what happened You
know and and I and I and he did show me
[SPEAKER_02]: like the the roadkill skunk that he had
and and whatever It was just like whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: like that Like let's just go be our own
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't I wasn't impressed, you know,
so So, you know as far as roadkill skunk,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's one interaction I had with it and
then before Matt right was on a team fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: you Masonic I would dive into his lives
and they would like talk about and he'd
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, you know Snivel that other
people even mentioned in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like it's like it was always
like the way I look at it is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, dude What are you smoking right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, like you got a swisher sweet
and an eighth from the dispensary in a
[SPEAKER_02]: plastic can like okay like as far as I'm
concerned You have no say in anything like
[SPEAKER_02]: just shut the fuck up and roll up your
weed and just smoke away, you know But
[SPEAKER_02]: like if you got some full mouth and you're
over there just Fino hunting every day
[SPEAKER_02]: you're every day You're rubbing into
plants becoming one with the plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're just you're on the pulse your
fingers on it I want your I want your
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective now, you know, but and and if
there's a old-school guy that's still on
[SPEAKER_02]: the pulse Smoking every day smoking the
new keeping around the old.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's who I want to hear the perspective
On RKS, you know, so and and even then I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: not like as far as I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Who cares?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah sure So another topic which I
think is still people trying to flesh it
[SPEAKER_03]: out because there's just the ambiguity
around it is all of the OGs You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's so many variations in different
cuts and it's the the lineage is still a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of mystery around it all What
are some of your preferred OGs and what's
[SPEAKER_03]: your thoughts on the TK?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a lot of people Think that the TK
is probably the original Where do you sit
[SPEAKER_03]: that one compared to the other OG cuts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well the thing with the OGs there was a
lot of all right here I go talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing I don't know about okay what I
know from me being a consumer in Los
[SPEAKER_02]: Angeles Where there was a lot of
dispensaries that primarily sold OG I seen
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of vanity strains as I like to call
it or even renaming so that helped Pollute
[SPEAKER_02]: the namesake of you know TK maybe you
know, so That's probably I've had TK by
[SPEAKER_02]: itself really really great strain But I've
also had you know abusive og and you know
[SPEAKER_02]: fire og radiation og spider-man og Batman
og fucking sad og happy og, you know every
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking og known man and they're all very
similar and they're all very Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've only I've grown the Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've grown the hardcore Fuck, you know and
og I don't I don't really have like a
[SPEAKER_02]: marker for what's the the real one but
it's it's better to go get a TK cut
[SPEAKER_02]: because You know, at least you know what
you're growing Yeah So I guess the
[SPEAKER_03]: question then becomes you know,
I think most people have Had a cut given
[SPEAKER_03]: to them at some point where it wasn't what
it was labeled be it either
[SPEAKER_03]: unintentionally mislabeled or just the
person wasn't aware they had the wrong cut
[SPEAKER_03]: have you ever had that happen to you and
Which cut was the one you were hoping to
[SPEAKER_03]: get but then like it didn't turn out to be
the right thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that hasn't happened but I have gotten
Cuts that weren't labeled and they were
[SPEAKER_02]: dope hit them to Wilson and sell them as
is So they'll be like hey, what's will
[SPEAKER_02]: auto it ain't a gelato cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for most Motherfucking sure I don't
know man, like my homie bad motherfucker
[SPEAKER_02]: gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cool and I hit it to Wilson and
People were asking me what it is because
[SPEAKER_02]: they love it and I'm like, they're like,
well, I like it and that's it You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: no need to fake the funk be like,
oh, you know gelato Bag seed like try to
[SPEAKER_02]: come up with a story on the spot Like no,
I called it will auto because I I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know where in my right mind I I convinced
myself there was gelato and then I start
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking what real gelato And I'm like that
ain't no fucking gelato and you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I'm like, you know will auto So,
I mean on that topic of you know clones
[SPEAKER_03]: and you clone library yours certainly
seems to be very Impressive, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you look at the crosses you've made it
seems like you've got access to a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: nice cuttings Do you keep these clones
around or do you just know you can access
[SPEAKER_03]: them again?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's your thoughts on people selling
clones for like really expensive price
[SPEAKER_03]: tags?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit I keep a nice network of people that
I Trust to give me cuts if I like if I
[SPEAKER_02]: really like something, you know Some cuts
even go as far as like okay fucking a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred people have them already like
there's no way that's gonna go anywhere
[SPEAKER_02]: like the Compton land race a Lot Compton
land race.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole nother thing But like a lot
of people have that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so like and that's not even my cut So like
that's kind of how cuts work for me like
[SPEAKER_02]: if I want something To get spread I'll
give it to ten of my friends, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and and of course other people are gonna
have it But that's the point, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so That's kind of how that goes down me
keeping cuts I flip everything like I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: keep some cuts on mom amount for a while
and then I'll be like, okay I'm tired of
[SPEAKER_02]: GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've crossed it to Wilson ten times
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think I can let it go I think
enough people in the world have GMO for me
[SPEAKER_02]: to get it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's never been anything that's like
like Fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really can't rely on somebody else to
keep it around for me You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so there's never been anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there is something that I want like
that I make sure to give it to at least
[SPEAKER_03]: five motherfuckers Sure, and I think the
obvious follow-up to that is was there
[SPEAKER_03]: ever a cutting or a strain that you had
for a while and you're fond of it and then
[SPEAKER_03]: you lost it and all the sudden like no one
else has got and it's gone forever Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: my portfolio of strain knowledge in that
is very minimal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no way Jose, man, you guys be like you
stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been you know about strains for four
years Like what what could you possibly
[SPEAKER_02]: have that you miss so much, dude,
you know, so I've yet to have that happen
[SPEAKER_02]: to me You know having something like oh
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a game changer and I lose it No,
that hasn't happened yet as far as a game
[SPEAKER_02]: changer Everything's you know,
everything's everything so it's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: just works for me I've never had there are
strains that excite me more than others
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't put all my eggs in that
basket.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it never really hits me that hard if
something doesn't follow through like I
[SPEAKER_03]: want it to Sure, and just as a follow-up
because I'm not sure we we chatted about
[SPEAKER_03]: it What's your thoughts on people who sell
cuttings?
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially like I guess the question for
me is more interesting is the person who
[SPEAKER_03]: found the cut So like they they put in
some work to maybe the buy the seeds or
[SPEAKER_03]: tofino hunt themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your thoughts on selling that?
[SPEAKER_02]: at that point so touching on It's it's
happening to me now where I've done some
[SPEAKER_02]: work and they're using my name to sell the
cut for high price and it's kind of it
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves a nasty taste in my mouth like So
what I'm gonna do so that I don't complain
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'm not a complainer Like that's
as far as I go as complaining is me
[SPEAKER_02]: telling you is I address the situation So
what I do is I grab same said cut And put
[SPEAKER_02]: it in my hands and just lower the price
and now I'm happy So yeah, it can bother
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll put that into I'll put I'll get in
the driver's seat and just bust out a
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking million trays and stand on the
corner and Fucking sell it for $10 just to
[SPEAKER_03]: make me happy Yeah, I mean that's it's
proactive, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that Yeah, man So you touched on
just a moment ago?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Compton land race and I've been
interested in this one for a while most
[SPEAKER_03]: notably because I think the name is
interesting It's obviously not a true land
[SPEAKER_03]: race What's the backstory behind this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Compton land race.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so it's face-off og i-9-5 Stardog
from seed that I got that I hunted in my
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor when I was running my indoor that I
got from secret society company and then
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when I was like man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I suck at indoor like I need a you know Do
something with this I spent all my tax
[SPEAKER_02]: income money on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work at Rite Aid My wife's yelling at
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I turned my whole garage into a grow like
I need to do something So here goes all
[SPEAKER_02]: willy-nilly, you know, I hit them all to
Wilson So boom we got face-off og i-9-5
[SPEAKER_02]: Stardog Wilson One of the first set of
Wilson hybrids that I made so I grow that
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no Okay, so I have that seed stock
my buddy Down the way who's in Compton
[SPEAKER_02]: still is growing it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grows it out and He's like,
oh man, I'm growing out your face off og
[SPEAKER_02]: i-9-5 Stardog Wilson, you know,
like what should I do with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like just grow it and he's like,
oh I got this Mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when capulator had done is his Mac
From seed, you know the first drop and
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody went crazy for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he also had a meat breath now and He's
like well, I'm gonna throw it outside and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna let it get hit by These and I'm
like like whatever, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know and then sure enough he does the
pollination So it's face-off og i-9-5
[SPEAKER_02]: Stardog Wilson potential males Mac or meat
breath and then cool we got this seed
[SPEAKER_02]: stock and It's it's called motormouth at
this point and I go to Oklahoma and I sell
[SPEAKER_02]: that shit to everybody as is like on the
fucking package Open pollination Mac meat
[SPEAKER_02]: breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just like fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're me Sonic I'll take one and then so
whatever that happens and I grow that shit
[SPEAKER_02]: out and In my yard and and and I'm like,
whoa, this is actually not half bad and I
[SPEAKER_02]: had a peanut butter breath now that hit it
and That's that's Compton land race So
[SPEAKER_02]: it's face-off og i-9-5 Stardog potential
males Mac meat breath times peanut butter
[SPEAKER_02]: breath and then I hit it back to Wilson
again, so But that's Compton land race
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Compton land race times Wilson Wow,
that's got a bit of everything for
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I Mean, I mean it's just a fun little
project,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know So when I take a dab I take you
really really huge dabs out of everything
[SPEAKER_02]: because you know we work hard for that
shit, so I'll grab like a you know a Dab
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not gonna get fully hit per se You
know everything on the sticks not gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: get smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll have a container where every time
I'm done with that dab I'll throw it in
[SPEAKER_02]: there So there's a hundred flavors that I
did that jar to to the point where it got
[SPEAKER_02]: filled to the brim that I had to split it
in two jars So that's what I just smoked
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoked one of those jars lovely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like like a bit of Everything the
jungle mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gumbo for sure It's a big old
gumbo, but that one tasted like the
[SPEAKER_02]: rainbow belts that I was smoking so had a
lot of Rainbow belts of skittles if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not I'm dumb, but it tasted like skittles
There's all types of skittles tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just fucking skittles everything
That's a good point to talk about for a
[SPEAKER_03]: second I find that skittles is interesting
because the overwhelming majority of
[SPEAKER_03]: people love the flavor of it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it got big.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's done well for itself But you get a
small subsect of people who are like just
[SPEAKER_03]: tastes like soap to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you sit on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't taste like soap to me skittles has
its own unique Profile, I got privy to
[SPEAKER_02]: skittles not in the States, but when I
would go travel to Barcelona they fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: love skittles out there and Fucking ski
toes, you know if it ain't skittles
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking get the fuck out of here So,
uh, you know, I fell in love with it out
[SPEAKER_02]: there came back home and it's been a rap
since and it ain't so I've had some soapy
[SPEAKER_02]: shit before and Fucking disgusting and and
and that's crazy because I've never liked
[SPEAKER_02]: like I can't even say what weed that is I
can just I'm just like dude you had that
[SPEAKER_02]: in the fucking laundry or something You
know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean because there's no way weed can be
that fucking bad But if it is man,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's probably like the only strain that
I'll hate You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean and it ain't skittles cuz skittles
ain't that soapy shit And one time I did
[SPEAKER_02]: have a strain like that when we were in
Colorado I was smoking with ginger lar and
[SPEAKER_02]: and and and and fucking I forgot his
fucking name But he's a real Rockies homie
[SPEAKER_02]: and they'd be able to tell you what
fucking strain that was But hopefully I
[SPEAKER_02]: can you know, show them this podcast and
they'll be like, oh that was this train
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm gonna be like fuck that strain
That's the only strain I hate There you
[SPEAKER_03]: go, I mean you touched on the the
Barcelona Scene which I think is an
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting sort of scene in its own,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your thoughts when you go over
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like in a couple years?
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be kind of where the USA scene is
Do you feel like they follow the USA
[SPEAKER_03]: trends too much?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your thoughts overall?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's two whole different vibes G even
amongst us in LA from state to state city
[SPEAKER_02]: to city so You can't replicate that,
you know the the the let alone the fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: the city You're in like you're in you're
in like old world, you know Catalonian
[SPEAKER_02]: Land and then next, you know, you're
smoking a joint like you can't replicate
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you know, so it's its own thing
Sure, and I mean interestingly we've seen
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of people leave California Say since
the start of the year often citing things
[SPEAKER_03]: like that It's too hard to get into the
legal market rents in California are quite
[SPEAKER_03]: prohibitive things Like that and they're
moving to other states Do you feel like
[SPEAKER_03]: Barcelona or some of these other states
will eventually take the lead over Cali as
[SPEAKER_03]: the hotspot?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think it's always going to
retain that title of like the weed Mecca
[SPEAKER_03]: of the world so to speak?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the Cali will remain the Mecca I
think but other places will emulate and
[SPEAKER_02]: innovate, you know what we got going here
some places, you know already do that so
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, California I think is the
fucking you know, the place that people
[SPEAKER_02]: you know good weed in California go
hand-in-hand Yeah, Touche too,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So on that note of doing a dab right there
and I think I can see you grinding up some
[SPEAKER_03]: flour right now My question is if you had
to pick one or the other, which would you
[SPEAKER_03]: be a concentrate or a flower guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I'm not hash all day G hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love me some dad some hash Hell yeah,
and what sort of style of hash do you like
[SPEAKER_03]: water hash?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like dry sieve?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what's your preferred if you could
choose anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: Full melt full melts water extracted hash
is you know rare but it's there and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: my favorite full body for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just feels the best and second is hash
rising really great, too Sure good picks
[SPEAKER_03]: good picks Do you feel like water hash and
more importantly as you alluded to?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know full melt, you know,
the five-star the best quality you can get
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like it's almost becoming a
bit of a dying art?
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we're seeing a lot of
concentrates in the market But water hash
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't seem to be as well represented as
say like BHO or some other styles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean It's easier to polish a turd with
BHO and those other styles With full melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fire in fire out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that shit's not pristine,
it's just not gonna be good, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so You can't really hide a lot in full
melt So a lot of people aren't the most
[SPEAKER_02]: versed so they can't achieve full melt and
if they do it's not up to par so they end
[SPEAKER_02]: up squishing it into hash rising because
Lord knows They would rather have some
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking full melt, too But you know,
it's it's probably has too much
[SPEAKER_02]: particulate in it Or just doesn't you know
smoke as good as the hash rising you can
[SPEAKER_02]: make what it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: So That's the case with full melt Sure,
and do you think that it just worked out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Coincidentally that like the Wilson male
is really good for adding trichomes for
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of making strains that would suit
this style I guess what I'm trying to ask
[SPEAKER_03]: is do you breed for concentrate production
or it was just sort of a like a happy
[SPEAKER_03]: coincidence that that was how the Wilson
male Happens to affect crosses Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was a happy coincidence because it
could have been I could have been when I
[SPEAKER_02]: made that Like that was it like it could
have been something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could have been too strange from
somebody else Who wasn't as good as only
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and that would have never
happened So it was all coincidental and it
[SPEAKER_02]: just so happens these wash really well
papaya washes really well banana OG washes
[SPEAKER_02]: really well trop F2 just so happens to
Wash all three to them together fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there was nothing that you know
reduce the quality and the genetic per se
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm not a fucking You know,
I'm talking about shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about because you know,
I'm just fucking like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it is what it is Sure So you mentioned
earlier that a lot of your breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: involves hitting Wilson to things and kind
of seeing what comes out of it Do you ever
[SPEAKER_03]: approach any crosses where you've you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of think of it conceptually and
you're like, oh, I think that these two
[SPEAKER_03]: strains are gonna pair really well
together Or is it just a bit more sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: haphazard in the way you approach it and
you're just like well if it's gonna work
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna work.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how do you approach making it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually What the mom's about you
know, so if mom's banging I like the mom,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know I'm like, oh, this is gonna be
cool, you know, cuz that's what I like But
[SPEAKER_02]: if it's like oh like here goes nothing,
you know Hopefully someone likes it then
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what that is and and that's exactly
what that is because there's people that
[SPEAKER_02]: like stuff that other people don't like
and Fucking that's how life is,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know fucking colors and shit Yeah,
sure So on the topic of Wilson we had a
[SPEAKER_03]: few listeners chime in and ask What would
be some of your top picks for the Wilson
[SPEAKER_03]: crosses if they're kind of thinking about
snatching something up from the site?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you recommend?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's like your sort of personal
favorites?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well shit, I would ask them what's their
favorite, you know, like what do you like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I just so happen to have that cross
the Wilson go check that out I would tell
[SPEAKER_02]: them go grab Wilson by itself,
but that's gone, you know So they can have
[SPEAKER_02]: a marker of what they're getting into and
see what that Wilson even brought to said
[SPEAKER_02]: mother said strain So they could be like,
oh cool Like I see the Wilson in the GMO
[SPEAKER_02]: because I've actually smoked Wilson before
So, uh, I I used to tell people go get
[SPEAKER_02]: Wilson.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's all like oh get what you like
Oh, you like gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go grab the g33 Wilson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you want like some old land race type
shit You want some antique shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got you, you know fucking you want some
exotics?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got you, you know cover every every
every marker, but uh Yeah, I would tell
[SPEAKER_02]: them to grab what they like and if they
don't know what they like I'll tell them
[SPEAKER_02]: go grab the five for 100 because you're
just gonna get a bunch of Seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking you're gonna have fun and you
won't feel bad because it wasn't a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars for fucking 12 seeds It was you
know way cheaper Sure Another question we
[SPEAKER_03]: got from a lot of customers was regarding
testing and I think that there
[SPEAKER_03]: historically has been this sort of
Tradition of people testing their crosses
[SPEAKER_03]: but in a more recent sort of turn of
events We've had many breeders come on the
[SPEAKER_03]: show and say that if you're gonna make
crosses And test them out and do the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: nine yards Often the trend and the hype
has come and gone before you can get that
[SPEAKER_03]: to market.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you subscribe to that idea and do you
tend to test?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's a nice way of putting it,
you know The way they say it, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's that's fuck Yeah, that's that's
like, you know, you sound you sound cool
[SPEAKER_02]: saying that but yeah straight up New shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just put it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't test new shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, they're not they don't
have to buy That shit there's a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: strains that are two years old almost to
date That are tested and I got numbers and
[SPEAKER_02]: I can show you a thousand pictures of so
you can be like, oh I like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know or you can you know fucking do
what I do and just grow any fucking seed
[SPEAKER_02]: and see what fucking happens and and be on
top of the game and what they said by the
[SPEAKER_02]: time, you know, I test any runs cross or
any given hype strain The new one's gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: be out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fucking it's just just be honest about
it Fucking if you didn't test it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you didn't test it easy does it and and if
nobody needs to buy it But if they won't
[SPEAKER_02]: test it, I got that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a hundred fucking strains that are
tested You know fucking there's a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of everything so and everything will
be tested fucking from the day you grab
[SPEAKER_02]: that strain Fucking somebody else,
you know, three weeks later is gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: like boom Here's the pictures and I'll be
like here's your tested motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good day Because that's exactly
what it is, you know fucking they can say
[SPEAKER_02]: like oh, you know fucking I don't think
they're Like a chart and like a 200 fino
[SPEAKER_02]: hunt on every strain they make I Highly
doubt it and they're like, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know 20% herms and you know germ rate,
etc No, most of the time is all like oh
[SPEAKER_02]: the homie fucking that I never even met on
Instagram that I sent testers to Popped
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sent me a couple pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave me a cool perspective and Some
people do have their testers and you know
[SPEAKER_02]: all power to them like capulator the
stranded I can't really stranded Until cap
[SPEAKER_02]: is finished testing it So, you know,
I do abide by those rules when I need to
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know with a cross with cap He's
not gonna let you know a bunch of herms
[SPEAKER_02]: pop up with his collab with Masonic
because it'll be funny so But yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, there's a hundred tested
strains guys, you know fucking you want
[SPEAKER_02]: some test this shit I got you you want to
be you know, the new guy with the new shit
[SPEAKER_02]: I got that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, whatever you want sure So you
mentioned earlier that Wilson as a pure
[SPEAKER_03]: strain was sold out Do you have a plan to
remake it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you like the idea of like there
being some amount of exclusivity by not
[SPEAKER_03]: just continually remaking strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now f2 that that's it, you know,
whoever got it They got it if they want to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep a clone of it around and let it
circulate You know by all means we're
[SPEAKER_02]: working on the f3 already So, you know,
I already have the f3.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna pop those out Maybe find a
keeper rotate that around and make the f4
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice and I mean another question is about
new males, you know, everyone's familiar
[SPEAKER_03]: with the Wilson work So we had quite a few
questions regarding possible new males and
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed on your website that there were
in fact a few crosses that Utilized a
[SPEAKER_03]: monkey berries male which I believe is
from exotic genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's strawberries and cream
Across to grease monkey my high ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happened there what I do every
year so two years ago or a year ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: I like you grow a lot of seeds,
right and there's males and and Sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: you spent money on them and you're just
like fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want this male to go to waste It's
like a cool mo it has runs in it or has a
[SPEAKER_02]: grease monkey in it You know, it's it
looks promising amongst, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's Counterparts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I do what I did is I like hey Los
Angeles who wants to make a strain with
[SPEAKER_02]: Masonic and they're like So I was like,
okay come grab this male hit it to you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, your selection bring me half the
seeds You know, you keep half I keep half
[SPEAKER_02]: so everything that isn't a Wilson hybrid
on my site was pollinated and And it
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't like a random person the people
that I did have do it were part of my
[SPEAKER_02]: People that become my friends now like,
you know Long Beach reefer did the monkey
[SPEAKER_02]: berry cross for me I've been popping did
the Blissful wizard cross for Masonic seed
[SPEAKER_02]: company or for himself However,
you want to look at he made the seeds You
[SPEAKER_02]: know that I just so happen to have on my
website that I provided the male for that
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew out that I selected for them I'm
like, hey, you should use this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cool promising strain same thing
with slaps, which is runs grease monkey
[SPEAKER_02]: and There's a couple more that probably
aren't Even you know up for grabs but that
[SPEAKER_02]: I have that I've done what you know Bunch
of other of my buddies that grow as well
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're super into it because you know
they get to fucking make seeds and keep
[SPEAKER_02]: them and now they're in other people's
hands because you know I got a big Avenue
[SPEAKER_02]: to put seeds in people's hands and they're
like cool fucking my seeds are in Ecuador
[SPEAKER_02]: now, you know Yeah, you made that in your
backyard fucking good shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did that together.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a team effort Yeah,
that's a good way to do collapse.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in general, what do you Looking for in
a strain when you're looking to pop a new
[SPEAKER_03]: one and maybe find a male in it And I
guess in general are you a fan of exotics
[SPEAKER_03]: work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything I've grown from exotic I grew
the the funky charms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew the strawberries and cream I grew
the slaps the grease monkey strawberries
[SPEAKER_02]: and cream I grew the slaps and Everything
so far has been I haven't been like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, that's just not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, everything's been great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually everything was great and fucking
When selecting anything is just you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course, I'm not gonna go with the runs,
you know the runs It's like all right,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's no bueno Just the best shit you
can tell fucking the shit that stacks the
[SPEAKER_02]: most the shit that smells the most You
know the more vigorous ones Shit like that
[SPEAKER_02]: people want to make it like this this this
fucking hard-ass process, but you know you
[SPEAKER_02]: put Five fools in front of me and I can
tell you who's more athletic, you know
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking it ain't the fool that weighs 300
pounds You know, it's it's the six foot
[SPEAKER_02]: tall dude who's fucking built like a
linebacker.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing with plants You could
see it could feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been growing for ten years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you could fucking tell which one is
better than the other one Definitely and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a great answer in terms of segueing
to the next question, which is What are
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the traits you look for in a male
when you're looking to breed with?
[SPEAKER_03]: It or is it more of a process of like feel
and like you've got a hunch on this one
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the way I chose this one you just
stuck out the most you know, he was the
[SPEAKER_02]: more The bigger one, you know,
he just grew the fastest and That's how I
[SPEAKER_02]: chose my most recent male that I have so
It just sticks out amongst the pack and it
[SPEAKER_02]: is a hunch if you want to call it that and
as far as like oh I look for Internotal
[SPEAKER_02]: spacing and all that other bullshit like I
didn't dive that deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like that's the one we're gonna
do work Let's do work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything all the progeny from it has
been a one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it worked Yeah, you just
kind of touched on an interesting topic
[SPEAKER_03]: there and I think DJ short kind of
summarizes at the best himself where he
[SPEAKER_03]: says He kind of says look, you know Some
people will tell you that there's certain
[SPEAKER_03]: things you can look at in a male and it'll
indicate whether it's gonna be a good or
[SPEAKER_03]: bad father And he was like but at the end
of the day fuck all that it's about
[SPEAKER_03]: testing the seeds and if the seeds are
good The male was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you subscribe to that idea?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think there are certain things
you can look at the mail and be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, you know This one's got the short into
nodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be better No, no, I haven't talked
to a Breeder and dove in that deep and and
[SPEAKER_02]: respected that opinion to that point,
you know But uh, there are some there are
[SPEAKER_02]: some things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know the other day I learned That
you know the the root ball in any given
[SPEAKER_02]: male could be you know Like a good
indicator of a good male because you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it has a bigger stomach per se and it can
uptake nutrients and shit but uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: but DJ short is right in the way that you
know, if the shit's good, it's good and
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking and No matter how you fucking
chose the male There's no denying that
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking you could have did the any
mini-mini-mo method, you know You could
[SPEAKER_02]: have your neighbor choose for you like
fucking you could have pulled it out a
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking hat But as long as the shit's
fucking good, that's what matters and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, whatever selection method you have
That's good too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You fucking you know everything about
weed, you know every fucking you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry I'm using the effort,
you know every every scientific term for
[SPEAKER_02]: every part on the plant like you're the
man dog, you know good shit you're the
[SPEAKER_02]: wizard and Those guys are usually the ones
that you know like to be the ones with the
[SPEAKER_02]: crown and shit So my thing is just do it
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just just make the shit grow the shit and
Be happy So let's say you decide to pop a
[SPEAKER_03]: new strain, you know, we'll just say that
the monkey berries from exotic You've
[SPEAKER_03]: decided you want to run some of it Do you
generally have a certain number of seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: you like to run?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like do you feel like one packs enough or
you like to get a couple packs?
[SPEAKER_03]: How does that work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, man I get away with popping six of
them motherfuckers, Doug I'll pop half the
[SPEAKER_02]: pack and or or the whole pack,
you know and and Fucking most of the time
[SPEAKER_02]: you find some dope shit in there Sometimes
nothing comes out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the fucking seeds won't even make it
you'll get all males and you'll be like
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing Sometimes you get the most
beautiful female and you're just like damn
[SPEAKER_02]: like that's that's that's some gangster
ass weed right there but uh, and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: never more than fucking one pack the only
shit that I do more than one pack is when
[SPEAKER_02]: I cross it to Wilson again because now I I
got more shit to play with you know what I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean, so I can cross I can pop,
you know As opposed to you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I went and bought a hundred dollar plus
pack of 12 seeds from any given breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm like fuck you with these
seeds, you know, like I don't want these
[SPEAKER_02]: to go to waste So I hit them to Wilson and
then now I got a million of them,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know So now I can go play with these
more and and that's kind of when it comes
[SPEAKER_02]: to big fino hunts It's most likely gonna
be a Wilson hybrid Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean it makes sense, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess the kind of the final question
on fino hunting I have is that when you do
[SPEAKER_03]: run some new seeds are you primarily
looking at the females and if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: impressed by the females you then consider
using a male or is it the other way around
[SPEAKER_03]: where you go into it thinking I want to
find a female Sorry a male.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to find a male.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's never want to find a male It's
the male is always Wilson is is my male
[SPEAKER_02]: unless it's like what the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, then then I'll do what I did
with the other ones, you know where I you
[SPEAKER_02]: know outsourced them to another person So
there's no cross pollination going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Sometimes and it's not even looking for
a male.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all like That has a nice calling to
it or you know, we we can hype that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know Like that's runs times this we
should totally continue that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: cuz people are gonna want that,
you know Or or that's a CBD or you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's freak show freak shows gnarly,
you know Or that's Australian bastard
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis no matter what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to continue that you know What I
mean, so it's shit like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's it's there's equations to wanting to
keep something around whether it be in
[SPEAKER_02]: female or in malform Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just mentioned CBD and I noticed on
your site that you actually do have a CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: cross using the I think it's the auto
Colorado cherry mother cross to Wilson Is
[SPEAKER_03]: this something you did because you
specifically wanted to be able to provide
[SPEAKER_03]: people with a CBD option?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think that there's actually a
bit more to CBD than most people?
[SPEAKER_03]: Think and you've got kind of some future
plans to work with it more So my buddy had
[SPEAKER_02]: did CBD seed stock like by itself So he
had fucking a whole room full of that shit
[SPEAKER_02]: and he's like hey Masonic like want to
sell some CBD and I'm I don't know shit
[SPEAKER_02]: about CBD like and he's like well,
you know, he put me on game and he's like
[SPEAKER_02]: it's Box Colorado cherry box auto or some
shit like that is I should know what it
[SPEAKER_02]: is, but that's that's what it is it's auto
box Colorado cherry auto times Wilson and
[SPEAKER_02]: He's all I used to sell it so I start
selling it to people and as CBD and People
[SPEAKER_02]: are growing it and they're sending me the
back results and it's CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank fucking god.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's CBD And I'm all like and I'm like
man, everybody keeps asking me for CBD,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know CBD CBD So I already had CBD so I
was selling them that it wasn't a Wilson
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrid yet I was selling them to it as a
And I still have some of that stock and
[SPEAKER_02]: then I'm like fuck it, you know,
I'm a gross on myself, too So I have this
[SPEAKER_02]: bed and I just literally just fucking Like
cuz I had a lot of it I just threw a
[SPEAKER_02]: handful in there and I grew out a bed full
of CBD hit it to Wilson So in that CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: seed stock, it's actually like any given
mother that she'll get in there times
[SPEAKER_02]: Wilson But it's it's box auto box cherry
times Wilson though, and that's exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are growing it I've yet to get test
on it, but it is a CBD THC grass Great and
[SPEAKER_03]: and is that something you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Want to maybe delve a little deeper into
in regards to just generally CBD stuff or
[SPEAKER_03]: do you just like being able to provide
that option?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to cover everything and you know,
I got a lot of questions on CBD CBD,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and I'm all like bullshit,
you know, I'll this ain't fucking you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, I Don't have like a paper and shit,
but you know, this is as much as I can
[SPEAKER_02]: tell you on CBD we had like some POA and
shit, but you know how from county to
[SPEAKER_02]: county to state to state hot can you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: It can go from up and down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some places it could have been hot and
shit So, you know my buddy almost got in
[SPEAKER_02]: trouble for that But the way I sold it is
like look here asshole like this is CBD,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like this isn't you're not
getting this with the fucking lawyer or
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing This isn't I'm not going over here
telling you to go do a whole cash crop,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know fucking in Idaho somewhere where
they grow a bunch of it I don't know but
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just giving you a Couple and it is CBD
but it is because I got tests and fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: you know people love it and he did too And
it's just it's just hot in some places
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to others Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you know, the variation is is
somewhat intrinsic to plants, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they're not they're not identical of
each other Another cross I noticed on your
[SPEAKER_03]: site which caught my eye Was actually you
did a cross using the Romulan clone and I
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted to ask what's your thoughts on the
Romulan?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's come up a few Times in the show
because as far as we can tell it might be
[SPEAKER_03]: the oldest clone in existence If you trace
it back, it appears to be older than most
[SPEAKER_03]: things Do you think your cuts the original
and are you a fan of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got Romulan from three sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got Romulan from some dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty you know, like he's You
know, he's not like out here like Masonic,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know 40k followers but you know,
like he was in the forums back in the day
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know, he can talk to you know,
all these esteemed growers and shit and
[SPEAKER_02]: for whatever reason he reached out to me
and went as far as uh, I don't know how
[SPEAKER_02]: some way but We he ended up using my name
as his as his cloning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's Masonic cloner So he sent me a
Romulan cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's like pretty cool in the scene You
know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think you know growers know who
he is and stuff like cool growers or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever like like old-school fools,
you know as opposed to you know us new
[SPEAKER_02]: guys and he reached out and sent me a lot
of old-school shit and I kind of took it
[SPEAKER_02]: for granted because You get lost in the
sauce sometimes and you're just like yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, whatever use Masonic cloner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send me those clones He sends me like
everything anybody would ever want like as
[SPEAKER_02]: a starter pack and you're like,
whatever I hit him to Wilson and I did but
[SPEAKER_02]: like but you lost that relationship
because I wasn't too thankful about it
[SPEAKER_02]: because I should have been more thankful
about it because that's not just something
[SPEAKER_02]: you get and And I think back on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and whatever that's the whole nother
story but that's who I got one of my
[SPEAKER_02]: Romulans from and another Romulan I got
from one of my buddies who just he just
[SPEAKER_02]: trades back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So With him I wouldn't like Take it I take
it with a grain of salt more than anything
[SPEAKER_02]: because you know, it matters who you get
it from You know, so the Masonic cloner
[SPEAKER_02]: guy pretty tapped into the old-school
scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd imagine he'd have some Type of
Romulan, you know Other dude got it from
[SPEAKER_02]: probably four other fucking people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's you know, quote-unquote Romulan
There you go and and overall are you a fan
[SPEAKER_03]: of it or you think it's a bit of a
yesteryear one But the Wilson cross adds a
[SPEAKER_03]: new flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no fucking idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew it in my greenhouse amongst fucking
a thousand other strains hit it to Wilson
[SPEAKER_02]: probably looked at it twice and I need to
grow it out and to its full potential to
[SPEAKER_02]: be like that's Gucci and that's what I'm
doing I got Romulan Wilson I got six of
[SPEAKER_02]: them growing right now so I can grow a
nice big one to be able to tell you like
[SPEAKER_02]: That's John blaze or not Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to wait and see I noticed on
your Instagram Recently that you had
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned you were doing a collab with
soul fire and I like soul fire gardens I
[SPEAKER_03]: think he does some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us a little bit about is it the Don
magic one is that how you say it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah named after the pimp Don magic one So
what do you think's gonna what can people
[SPEAKER_03]: expect from that one in terms of flavor
profiles and whatnot?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, it's got a cool name.
[SPEAKER_03]: How'd you come up with the name just just
after the pimp?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well he it's cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Don Mecca and I'm just like Don Mecca
Don Magic one, you know, like the Don it
[SPEAKER_02]: just clicked right away So I'm like,
let's name it after this pimp guy,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so that's how we got the name He
thought it was a cool name.
[SPEAKER_02]: He totally rolled it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never named anything So, you know
fucking I had to really make it if I named
[SPEAKER_02]: some shit, I'm gonna matter so it mattered
He he went amongst himself Not he went
[SPEAKER_02]: him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did the Paul.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did all the legwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: He fucking found the female hit it to his
mouth I said me the seed stock and is
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know and went as far as growing
it all out Well, I'm like selling it the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like he'd be able to tell you more like
a What that plant actually does he's
[SPEAKER_02]: sending me some, you know, I'm going out
there or something like that, you know I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to accuse anybody of anything,
but I'm gonna be smoking some of that
[SPEAKER_02]: soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So That sounds like a cool cross I like a
lot of his work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you'll you'll do a nice little
combo together Yeah, I love so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a really dope guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grown a bunch of his stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grown his mind flair I grown his banana
runs and I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But and he grew my papaya God that's what
he hit the Don make a whip and papaya God
[SPEAKER_03]: is a Papaya cake times Wilson There you
go, I think yeah, I think it's gonna be a
[SPEAKER_03]: flavor town, right Yeah, fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I forgot to ask you a little bit
earlier when we were talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrates What's your thoughts on vape
carts?
[SPEAKER_03]: They themselves are quite polarizing and I
think the most interesting thing To think
[SPEAKER_03]: about in regards to all the vape carts is
like obviously they're they flood the
[SPEAKER_03]: market.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very prevalent but someone made
this comment where it was like You don't
[SPEAKER_03]: really see posts about buds with PM
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just see lots of carts Oh,
yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody gets PM anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you knew that Well, yeah,
nobody gets PM anymore and carts are
[SPEAKER_02]: mostly miss for the most part I actually
have a good Cart right here because I have
[SPEAKER_02]: buddies that make them and I get them,
you know from one hand only, you know
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of you know a farm to here to hair
to there but uh they're mostly miss and
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's not my preferred way of consuming
because It's just not it just doesn't feel
[SPEAKER_02]: right I rather drive around town with the
joint in my mouth then no vape cart and
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking cross my fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get busted Good good call good
philosophy As well so a lot of the vape
[SPEAKER_03]: carts we see entering the market are often
as you alluded from new Producers that
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a whole supply chain behind things
and usually it's not high quality because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going through all these different
hands What's your thoughts overall on
[SPEAKER_03]: someone coming into the market wanting to
do a vape company or?
[SPEAKER_03]: wanting to just start a new sort of
company because I think that there's often
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of distrust and a lot of dislike
from people who are just entering the
[SPEAKER_03]: scene now because it's often kind of
Painted as though like they're just trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to do a cash grab sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it's possible for someone to
come in and to want to do something like
[SPEAKER_03]: that and to do it properly or it's
inherently like a bit of a sketchy
[SPEAKER_02]: situation There's always a harder worker
so like There's always room for that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, don't don't be discouraged like
oh man, the cannabis scene is saturated
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not gonna want to fuck with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a thousand shovels to this
cannabis industry You just got to find you
[SPEAKER_02]: know Where you belong, you know,
like look at look at sticker farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He he he doesn't sell weed, but he's a big
part of it You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean as far as Instagram is concerned
Things like that So as far as you know a
[SPEAKER_02]: vape cart like you would have to do a lot
of homework to get into a vape cart scene
[SPEAKER_02]: cuz fucking it's not just something you do
cuz it's to this day's I still think
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of work to do on those cuz
Everyone has a fucking different one and
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't know which one's the good one
and I don't want to find out either cuz
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking Most of the time they're bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like fucking you already know
you're stepping into a trap So it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: hard to R&D on those as far as you know
mass-produced ones are concerned Stepping
[SPEAKER_02]: into the cannabis game if it's a cash grab
and that's what you're going in for
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking good luck I'll power to you and if
you fucking figure it out It's cuz you're
[SPEAKER_02]: a harder worker and you fit and somebody
was on their ass and you caught him
[SPEAKER_02]: slipping If you're in it with good
intentions, well remember There's the guy
[SPEAKER_02]: with the cash grab fucking attitude out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's trying to work fucking You know
trying to outsource work do whatever the
[SPEAKER_02]: case and wait till the institutions come
in and you think these little guys are
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to figure out these Institutions
are gonna fuck everybody up now sound like
[SPEAKER_02]: a crazy person like what's he talking
about these institutions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like yeah, man There's people with a lot
of money that can just buy everything and
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking hire lobbyists to prevent other
people from setting up shop so but we're
[SPEAKER_02]: not in that in that stage yet,
but eventually you know, we will be and
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking it's gonna be even harder for
people to Set up shop via marijuana Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean a brilliant point you mentioned
there and a discussion which we've had
[SPEAKER_03]: with a few previous guests is like what is
the sort of incoming big ag movement gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: do in regards to shaping the cannabis
scene and one of the ideas we've heard
[SPEAKER_03]: expressed is that There'll be like a
distinction between like the connoisseur
[SPEAKER_03]: or like the craft market And then just
like the mass produce sort of thing What's
[SPEAKER_03]: your thoughts on the big ag's?
[SPEAKER_03]: Involvement and do you think it'll pan out
as though like there'll always be this
[SPEAKER_03]: connoisseur?
[SPEAKER_03]: Craft market that we kind of currently
exist in and then the big ag will just be
[SPEAKER_03]: booth for the masses Or how do you predict
it plays out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man, they'll be Bud Light weed for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be some dudes that end up with a
sculpting company They get bought out by
[SPEAKER_02]: Bud Light and then there'll be the heady
beers that get bought out by all the heady
[SPEAKER_02]: boys all the time same thing with weed You
know fucking there's gonna be a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: booth and hopefully like like if you love
weed You're gonna learn about it and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're gonna go look for you know,
the small batch great shit Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: good sentiment a good sentiment so the
question that we've received the most
[SPEAKER_03]: inquiries about is This ongoing meme or
you're having with mr.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt riot of riot seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you able to give us a little bit of a
backstory?
[SPEAKER_03]: On how this all happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get along with only seed company.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my mentor speakeasy Seed company
used to work with Oni.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got into cahoots Riot try to be like
a mediator Amongst Oni and speakeasy,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, he's basically button his nose
in there He Whatever that's their deal,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so he's like On a fuck Oni
crusade and I just so happen to be
[SPEAKER_02]: associated with Oni So he's like saying
fuck Masonic on his live now my heart
[SPEAKER_02]: tracing because it's fucking Now he's
saying like cuz cuz I just get like
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking attack mode But so he's like fuck
Masonic fuck Masonic anytime anybody is on
[SPEAKER_02]: his life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, what about Masonic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he's dead to me, you know,
fuck that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's you know, he's he's a clown You know,
he's a bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a girl like all he's just just and
I'm just I stay quiet I stay Quiet every
[SPEAKER_02]: day a new a new a new message from
somebody Hey fool rice talking shit and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm life's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't need to be in a quarrel like
I don't need Publicity like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm chilling.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is old Masonic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to attack that's old me and I'm
just like fuck and and I go on my I go
[SPEAKER_02]: into my secret accounts and I go into this
page and Sure enough fuck Masonic fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: Masonic and I'm like man, you know what
fuck this shit And I just went and I just
[SPEAKER_02]: like man fuck you dude Like, you know as
much as I could and now I'm right seed
[SPEAKER_02]: company So and and blue bond, it's mine
clockwork orange is mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all my strings now 26 cookies
mine right Barry mine Right seed Co.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the real right seat Co.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matt right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my shit now So fucking you know,
don't fuck with me, you know wrong guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have just kept my name out your
mouth I was being really political about
[SPEAKER_02]: it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you say Masonic three times I
might end up being met right so I'm Matt
[SPEAKER_03]: right now Wow, what a what a turn of
events there so I guess the the follow-up
[SPEAKER_03]: question to that is Do you plan to release
strains that are using the names of
[SPEAKER_03]: strains?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's done or do you plan to make crosses
with them?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the situation now?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing it quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing it quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So none of my strains have names on them
So blueberry cement shoes times Wilson
[SPEAKER_02]: cross back to Wilson is now a blue bonnet
orange Skittles times banana punch times
[SPEAKER_02]: Wilson is now clockwork orange Girl Scout
cookie Polynesian thin mint Wilson is now
[SPEAKER_02]: 26 cookies and I'm gonna have to figure
out what other strains are gonna take what
[SPEAKER_02]: names for and we're gonna sell way more
seeds and he has people are gonna be like
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm growing blue bonnet and and fucking
they're gonna tag blue bonnet and We're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna have a thousand Wilson hybrids as
blue bonnet and fucking everybody's gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: know blue bonnet belongs to the real right
seed company sure and and do you think
[SPEAKER_03]: that people would rightly or Incorrectly
get upset with how like lineages are like
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a bit muddied when you do that Not
when Masonic they know what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what time it is There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay kind of a more meta idea to what
we've been discussing is that I'm I'm a
[SPEAKER_03]: part of obviously the cannabis scene along
with yourself But I'm also a part of a few
[SPEAKER_03]: other different online communities and
something that I've noticed over the past
[SPEAKER_03]: year or so is that the cannabis community
seems to have a bit of a disproportionate
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of drama in it considering It's
like a bit of an oxymoron like we all
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke weed We're meant to be chill and
calm and yet there's almost more drama
[SPEAKER_03]: than other communities where there isn't
this sort of the Psychoactive chemical
[SPEAKER_03]: that helps calm you out.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it used to be you smoke weed
you're cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean now It's all like I
smoke weed cooler than you or something
[SPEAKER_02]: like that I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to think my demographic I'm kind of
open arms, you know as opposed to you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, you got to know this much before you
enter here I like to think you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I cover every every demographic,
you know fucking I don't care what you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, like I'm I never answer questions
seriously on my life So like you're never
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna and if I do it's like it's like
feeding a dog Medicine, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I'm being funny and every now and
then I'll put some medicine in the dog
[SPEAKER_02]: food So, you know It goes to people every
now and then next, you know, you got
[SPEAKER_02]: people interested in actually wanting to
know about breeders You know, so and shit
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But uh, yeah fucking I got off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got off topic on the question,
but fucking yeah That's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess my question like the follow-up
would be is do you think that the sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: you know dramas we see play out will
continue or eventually people will maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: chill out a bit and kind of Be a bit more
like the the stereotype and just become a
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of a chill stoner You know what dude I
was chill bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem was I was chill till till
fucking Friday I'm cool, dude I'm like the
[SPEAKER_02]: guy that would throw rocks at everybody
but but not because I was being malicious
[SPEAKER_02]: but maybe a little bit but like it was
mostly to poke fun and to laugh at because
[SPEAKER_02]: like if they said something that I Didn't
agree with I would like poke fun at them
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's the internet And that's what you
can do on their net.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would make I would poke fun at jungle
boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would poke fun at coma I would poke fun
at Cali outdoor at anybody and everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: Next, you know fucking I'm on a I'm on a
meme war and then you know drama blood
[SPEAKER_02]: what people love and Then now we're all
friends and now I've come in to this part
[SPEAKER_02]: in life where I got a business I'm running
and and and I've apologized to anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've made upset like I've literally
gone out of my way and Like hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, like I'm sorry I didn't know how to
make friends and I was trying to get your
[SPEAKER_02]: attention So I was being mean and I made a
couple memes about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I'm in good graces with jungle boys
burner fucking coma Cali outdoor and I and
[SPEAKER_02]: all these people they all have different
demographics, you know, like like people
[SPEAKER_02]: that fuck with this guy don't fuck with
this guy and me I'm just I Rather be cool
[SPEAKER_02]: with everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if if they're fuck you Masonic and
they're like A big person and and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting that message out to everybody I'm
gonna say something about it If they're
[SPEAKER_02]: like a small dude that just kind of went
on my page and it's like fuck you Masonic
[SPEAKER_02]: ignore that You know, but if somebody's
out there like fucking with a fucking Holy
[SPEAKER_02]: Bible like, you know with their own
fucking crusade I'm like nah, man I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna put this to an end and and that's
the only drama you will get from me is is
[SPEAKER_02]: is Quick drama it used to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know, this guy's dumb about weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna poke fun at him Now now it's
like, okay, I'm over that we're running a
[SPEAKER_02]: business now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm nice to everybody now I'm not gonna
poke fun at nobody But this guy was saying
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck you a hundred times So fuck him and
I'm better at saying fuck you cuz I'm more
[SPEAKER_02]: computer savvy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm I've been on 4chan I'm better with
memes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how to make people laugh better and
that's where this drama comes and people
[SPEAKER_02]: are like, oh man Like can't we all just
get along like dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do just get along this motherfucker over
here is saying fuck you every fucking time
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I was tired of being quiet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I fucking said fuck you back and I'm
really good at saying it So I'd like
[SPEAKER_03]: brought back the old me Sonic Yeah,
good answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to jump back to something you
referenced a little earlier at the start
[SPEAKER_03]: of this sort of little answer to this
section here is that I noticed you have
[SPEAKER_03]: been posting recently about Pokemon and
yugioh cards and It all makes sense now
[SPEAKER_03]: because we're about the same age and so I
realize you would have been growing up
[SPEAKER_03]: with it about the same Time as me and I
likewise very into Pokemon and you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was a bee's knees Have you
ever played the game?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we more of like like did you actually
play the game the card game?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you just more of like a collector
and do you click that sort of stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I played the game as a kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't a collector.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I played and Whatever was meta at the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was playing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a Pokemon we played as kids not
serious, but we got into you yo And you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, we got you go serious business like
we go to the trading card store every
[SPEAKER_02]: weekend mom would give us both 20 to $40
and we'd make it work and we'd have to
[SPEAKER_02]: really learn and my older brother so I
always had a mentor and He would always
[SPEAKER_02]: get first place and I would always you
know get fifth or something but uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got better and And I don't know how to
play the TCG anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just played my son that Pokemon right
now I just opened two starter decks and
[SPEAKER_02]: the Charizard Theme decks that came out
and we played so I still know how to play
[SPEAKER_02]: but you go I bought a deck box a blister
box the other day and I'm like looking
[SPEAKER_02]: through the cards and I'm like fuck No,
I can't do this no more But I did recently
[SPEAKER_02]: stop playing when up whenever dark strike
fighter was banned and you go So yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm I did play a little bit I remember
spending a good chunk of my youth playing
[SPEAKER_03]: that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good for the meta Yeah,
man, it's it's a I still I still I'm into
[SPEAKER_02]: it and I noticed a lot of people like
Logic and I think is Jake Paul is that
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube sensations name?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess they started collecting them
amongst themselves again and right before
[SPEAKER_02]: that I had put out a big calling on my
Instagram I'm like dude anybody have
[SPEAKER_02]: Pokemon cards trade them to me and I did
it right before like Fucking prices went
[SPEAKER_02]: up now people don't even they think
they're in fucking And and rolling in
[SPEAKER_02]: gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just like this is a million
dollars and I'm like dude relax It's like
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not even great.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably not even make condition
and but uh everybody has their Pokemon
[SPEAKER_02]: cards and and you know, everybody's
looking for them because of The you know
[SPEAKER_03]: prices are skyrocketing right now sure So
the next thing I happen to notice which
[SPEAKER_03]: was like a bit of a rare niche sort of
thing is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Unlike a lot of people in the cannabis
community Who are really into dogs it
[SPEAKER_03]: appears as though you're more of a cat
person and you even rep the chicken a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit Which I think was kind of cool
What's the backstory behind that with the
[SPEAKER_03]: chicken and with the cats and is that
where your animal passion sort of lies?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Man, I got dogs too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't rep them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just don't sleep in the house man So,
you know, you don't get to see them as
[SPEAKER_02]: much and it just so happens you're
comfortable in on the phone the dogs Dusty
[SPEAKER_02]: sleeps in the house, but you know,
he's not as photogenic as The cats but I
[SPEAKER_02]: love dogs just as much so let's not let's
not confuse that I love all my animals the
[SPEAKER_02]: chickens actually before this interview I
have to put my chickens away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put them all in their coop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a lot of chickens and Cats I've
always loved cats chickens I would go to
[SPEAKER_02]: my grandma's farm in Mexico every summer
and winter and they had chickens so I grew
[SPEAKER_02]: up around chickens my whole childhood and
I even had ducks when I was a kid,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I've always been a fan of Chickens and
now they give me eggs and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's cool, too Then the pandemic I
already had my chickens and nobody had
[SPEAKER_02]: eggs But I had eggs and all my friends
wanted chickens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody was asking me about chickens
Like I was the fucking chicken ambassador.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go read a book next You know, they're
fucking way more versed in me and I'm like
[SPEAKER_02]: good, you know Love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it So I forgot to ask you earlier
You mentioned you do obviously a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: growing outdoors But we didn't and you and
you mentioned that you use salts for the
[SPEAKER_03]: seed production But what sort of medium do
you like to use outdoor?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just just soil from the ground or
you bring in a medium?
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you have a preferred brand of
nutrients you want to mention or you
[SPEAKER_03]: prefer just to leave it unsaid?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man I'll go grab a bag of roots
organics and Fucking run mills,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I get mills for free So I run it
easy does it if if I didn't have that I'd
[SPEAKER_02]: probably go grab veg bloom or something Or
you can always make a super soil and just
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking plug-and-play let that super soil
feed the whole time I had a bunch of bags
[SPEAKER_02]: of living soil from red bud soil that I
ran but I'm not over here like
[SPEAKER_02]: Declorinating anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just running straight from the hose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like it's kind of you know
oxymoronic to be growing like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but uh, yeah, it's Easy does it for me
like a seed production.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to do much Besides make
sure the plants are healthy and And
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking you're not over there Pruning and
picking making sure shit looks sexy Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to ask you about Your thoughts
on some of the festivals like the weed
[SPEAKER_03]: festivals and just selling seeds at them
in general because over the past few years
[SPEAKER_03]: we've seen a decline of the Emerald Cup in
terms of people being able to sell their
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds legally and more recently people are
kind of like are the vibes not really
[SPEAKER_03]: where it used to be and then lo and behold
I managed to catch up with you in person
[SPEAKER_03]: at the ego clash last year and That was a
cool event.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I guess my thoughts is sorry My
question is what's your thought on the
[SPEAKER_03]: Emerald Cup and its sort of trajectory?
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you think these smaller boutique
events like the ego clash are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: become more popular?
[SPEAKER_02]: dude fucking Emerald Cup man my ass my
dumbass like there's you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you feel like I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just feel poor sometimes, you know
fucking I'm walking around Emerald Cup
[SPEAKER_02]: Supposedly my buddy had a spot I could set
up at and sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like cool I got this huge box of me
full of seeds, you know, you have a spot
[SPEAKER_02]: for me cool We end up inside and it's not
even his program.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's somebody else's there's nowhere for
me to go So I'm fucking lugging this huge
[SPEAKER_02]: box of seeds around Emerald Cup,
you know and It's like and and it feels
[SPEAKER_02]: weird because I'm Masonic people are here
to visit me, you know as well as the
[SPEAKER_02]: Emerald Cup But I'm over here like lugging
a box around looking like a fucking chump,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like embarrassed almost like I
don't got booth space You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like it's almost impossible only cap
and exotic can apparently get booth space
[SPEAKER_02]: here and whoever else, you know But
whatever you grow and you make more money
[SPEAKER_02]: and now you in a position to maybe now I
can you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean get booth space if money talks,
you know but then I wasn't and and and and
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking supposedly I had a buddy that had
a booth and he's like a man set up right
[SPEAKER_02]: here that's cool and I set up and
apparently they were doing something they
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't supposed to be doing and like the
Emerald Cup fucking the daughter that was
[SPEAKER_02]: running the whole thing is like you guys
got to get out of here and like I like DBG
[SPEAKER_02]: was there or yeah Yeah, and and like they
had all their stuff on the table and and I
[SPEAKER_02]: think they were like trying to like kick
them out of the whole festival entirely
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was there but I had all my shit
tucked under the table a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: low-key and like they kind of overlooked
me and I just kind of grabbed my stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: like went to the side and Dude,
like fucking embarrassing and and yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: that is the vibes I got at Emerald Cup But
uh somehow some way I managed to like on
[SPEAKER_02]: the outskirts of you know people that
weren't peeping too hard I managed to
[SPEAKER_02]: backpack backpack a little bit of seeds
and not have my whole catalog with me and
[SPEAKER_02]: managed to You know push some seeds
peddling them on my feet around Emerald
[SPEAKER_02]: Cup, which is something I didn't really
want to do like fucking I should be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to have a booth, you know fucking this is
this is dumb, you know Yeah, definitely I
[SPEAKER_03]: think that's a sentiment that many of the
former breeders have expressed Do you
[SPEAKER_03]: think that things like the ego clash and
smaller events that maybe invite only sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of situation will become the more popular
and predominant sort of thing that the
[SPEAKER_03]: real heads are going to or do you Think
it's like the Emerald Cup still so big
[SPEAKER_02]: it's gonna draw the crowds I think I think
we got to do some some more of that ego
[SPEAKER_02]: clash shit but not to the point where it's
you know where we ring it too much because
[SPEAKER_02]: if you do something too much people get
fed up with it too, so recently I I did a
[SPEAKER_02]: pop-up at a hydroponic store and You know,
it was kind of it wasn't no ego clash,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, you didn't have to go to a
fucking Festival to go pick up seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so we can do a derivative of
that and whatever You know like an ego
[SPEAKER_02]: clash you could have an ego clash in your
city.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to be ego clash You just
be a sesh and grab some like-minded guys
[SPEAKER_02]: and maybe bring a star or something
because a little by little foods are
[SPEAKER_02]: coming out the woodwork and You know
people want to associate with others
[SPEAKER_02]: amongst themselves that smoke weed too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to give them that power You
can't be like, oh you guys aren't good
[SPEAKER_02]: enough to talk about breeding because
nobody breeds in Ohio but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's that's not fair they can all gather
and Have seeds too and make a cool cedar
[SPEAKER_02]: in their state, you know, so Whatever the
case be it's early shits growing people
[SPEAKER_02]: are getting bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be more breeders from more places
and There will be more like ego clash
[SPEAKER_03]: things I'd imagine yeah sure and I guess
final question before we get into Some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the fans admitted ones on the tail end of
things I remembered thinking that it was a
[SPEAKER_03]: very just you know weird situation to be
in that cave at the Em at the ego clash
[SPEAKER_03]: and like people had the booths and you had
your table set up and you're selling seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff and I thought this is like a
really like Unpredicted sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some of the most weird or
standout experiences?
[SPEAKER_03]: You've had while being in the industry or
selling seeds Well, that one is one of
[SPEAKER_02]: them sure enough being in a fucking cave
selling Seeds, you know, that was one of
[SPEAKER_02]: them I was in Atalanta one time fucking
selling seeds, you know on the outskirts
[SPEAKER_02]: of this huge Free dab festival.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a pretty nasty one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I One time I set up shop outside of a
target in Compton in the parking lot and I
[SPEAKER_02]: just had people come to me like if I was
selling mixtapes out my trunk and I like
[SPEAKER_02]: nitpickingly invited people like like you
look okay boom, you know So I took that
[SPEAKER_02]: and just expanded that into my pop-up So I
just screened more people via Instagram
[SPEAKER_02]: because you can tell a lot through
somebody's Instagram like come on like if
[SPEAKER_02]: you see some dude called Robin
motherfuckers, like you're not gonna let
[SPEAKER_02]: him go to your To your pop-up,
you know, like dude, your name is Robin
[SPEAKER_02]: motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like why would I let you come with me?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so, you know No, no no
discrimination, but if you look like you
[SPEAKER_02]: about the Jackson Buddy and you have no
pictures of your grow on your your weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably will never get invited to any
local Masonic shindigs So on the tail end
[SPEAKER_03]: of things we've just got a few Fans
submitted questions before we get to the
[SPEAKER_03]: final five or six quickfire questions
first one being What's your thoughts on
[SPEAKER_03]: shrooms you pro shrooms?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shrooms man, there's there They'll put you
in your place, you know, I even micro
[SPEAKER_02]: dosing man They'll make me shut the fuck
up and just go to my room and lock myself
[SPEAKER_02]: up for a bit and just put my phone down
For a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're a good reset I wouldn't
tell you to go to a heroic dose like like
[SPEAKER_02]: that but a Nibble at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: See how you like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people like him better than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm I get an easy with them so I do them
specifically Spontaneously, I'll nibble at
[SPEAKER_02]: them never more than More than a fucking
point one because if I eat a point three,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like hugging the floor like it's that
bad for me There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So next one was do you currently have any
plans to work with any males besides
[SPEAKER_03]: Wilson?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe maybe in this new Fino hunt that I'm
doing I have a bunch of elite crops
[SPEAKER_02]: Crosses crossed into Wilson, but it ended
up being a Wilson hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe maybe maybe so the next one which
I thought was interesting is would you
[SPEAKER_03]: ever consider doing a Wilson F2 or F3?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it would be classified
as where it's like your Wilson cross to
[SPEAKER_00]: Oni's Wilson zero That's a good idea Maybe
that we haven't even thought of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next question we had submitted was
are you more of an Indigo or a Sativa fan?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm more of an Indigo person Yeah,
sure and if you had to pick Hayes or Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So next one was out of all your strains
What's the most potent to you and what's
[SPEAKER_03]: the biggest yielder?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've got Out of the biggest Fino out
of anybody that I've got I got the Chem
[SPEAKER_02]: Di95 was probably one of the heaviest
Yielders Chem Di95 Wilson and out of
[SPEAKER_02]: personally that I smoked I hate to like be
cliche or put cream on my taco But I
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked some Wilson F2 that really blew my
socks off Now a good answer a bit of a
[SPEAKER_03]: more random one to round out the fan
submitted one What's your thoughts on the
[SPEAKER_03]: new Aesop album?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Aesop rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Oh Man, I have bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't listen to Aesop rock like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That fool uses too many words for me,
dog I need to go pull up a dictionary.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no way in God Anybody could
recite a whole Aesop rock song and if they
[SPEAKER_02]: can Jesus Christ your ass is really
sitting there digesting that shit You have
[SPEAKER_02]: to practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a fucking hundred times That guy's
dope though, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aesop rocks cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should probably check it out No worries
and the final fan submitted question
[SPEAKER_03]: before we do the final five What do you
think are the genetics in cookies?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a it's f1 dirt There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what will always be told
Alright, so final five quickfire ones from
[SPEAKER_03]: me.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the best or most memorable weed
you've ever smoked?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm Shit this is Herbert man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm it's pretty memorable because I had a
really I'll smoke nothing but concentrate
[SPEAKER_02]: like to today at ego and I was just like
man weeds not cutting it like flowers not
[SPEAKER_02]: cutting anymore and I'm my buddy of That
who's my buddy now.
[SPEAKER_02]: He he had a buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like a man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should talk to him he saw me in the
cave and he let me hit his pipe and It was
[SPEAKER_02]: a server and I'm like, what the fuck is
this shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: He let that server fool and and I'm like,
can I grab some and he like literally
[SPEAKER_02]: points at a 365 he was right there Or
canopy I think his name is and I and I
[SPEAKER_02]: went home with an ounce and ever since
then like, you know I was smoking nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: but hash but I went back on flower on that
day and to this date it just so happens
[SPEAKER_02]: you're asking me about it because a Cali
kosher they grew a bunch of it and
[SPEAKER_02]: randomly I'm like, hey like I like that
strain a lot and they're like sure we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: give you some and like randomly they
fucking brought me a quarter pound of that
[SPEAKER_03]: shit lovely synchronous, so On the other
end of the spectrum was there ever a
[SPEAKER_03]: strain where like everyone You know was
hyping it up and saying it's the bees
[SPEAKER_03]: knees and then you finally try it and you
were like this isn't that good I Tried
[SPEAKER_02]: some piff s1.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit was terrible dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that piff shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to shut the fuck up and sit down
I don't care like it's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like it's nostalgic and it's
reminiscent, but it's far from good It has
[SPEAKER_02]: this place, you know, it's all for the
inclusion
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so the next one you're about to
get dropped off at a desert island and you
[SPEAKER_03]: can only take three strains with you You
got to smoke for the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they gonna be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh I'll take some skittles with me I'll
take some GMO and some Wilson fuck it
[SPEAKER_03]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right now flip side of the coin.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're about to drop someone You don't
like very much off on the island and you
[SPEAKER_03]: get to pick the three strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're stuck with what are you gonna
leave them?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gonna get some some super lemon
haze they're gonna get some Malawi Panama
[SPEAKER_02]: red and fucking What's it and whatever
soapy strain that was that I smoked that
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Cool cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So final question is if you could go back
In time to anywhere any place any time
[SPEAKER_03]: collect either seeds or a clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where would you go?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what are you getting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mmm shit, I would just for my you know,
just for the culture I probably go in
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexico and find some shit over there just
because I could speak Spanish to Figure it
[SPEAKER_01]: out over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Yeah, that's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We definitely need some more land races
from down there Yeah, that'd be dope Love
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
