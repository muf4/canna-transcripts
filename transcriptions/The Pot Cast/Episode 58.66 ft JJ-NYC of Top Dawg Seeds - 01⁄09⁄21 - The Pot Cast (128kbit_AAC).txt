[SPEAKER_00]: chatting genetics History all things
related to top dog and so so so much more
[SPEAKER_00]: so without further ado Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Guess it sort of just speaks to that
idea of like how sort of the hazy Longer
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering sativa stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like it's really got a home in
New York Yeah, well, you know in New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know people always you know wanted the
best weed so And they want stuff that's
[SPEAKER_01]: different that not everyone else has so,
you know get yourself with a product
[SPEAKER_01]: that's unique You're able to do that and
almost build your own customer base off of
[SPEAKER_00]: that Yeah Definitely definitely You know,
I was talking to Bob Hemphill recently yet
[SPEAKER_00]: again and he mentioned how grateful he was
that you had gifted him an old sensei star
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting that you had and he was saying how
much he loved it and It made me think you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, will we see any more sensei star
crosses from you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it one you like to smoke and breed
with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I had I was given a cut from a
friend of mine from Washington and I Think
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, he told me it was one of the
old-time sensei star cuts and it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: more Stretchy one, I guess I guess there
was a couple different ones that were
[SPEAKER_01]: around So, um, yeah, so he gifted me that
and I did a little bit of work with it and
[SPEAKER_01]: then I lost it unfortunately, yeah,
I gave it to Bob and My friend I think He
[SPEAKER_01]: brought it back to an f3 or something or
f4 I'm not sure I he I have some of that
[SPEAKER_01]: some of his Seed stock that he made with
that original.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that he had gotten that cutting
and then got some original sensei star
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and then started to F1 and F2,
you know went back with it for a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: generations so that's what he based it off
of that cutting and so yeah, I just got to
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting and you know, I crossed it out to
the star dog and I think a chem cro
[SPEAKER_01]: another chem cross I can't quite remember
but I did a couple breedings with it and
[SPEAKER_01]: then I lost it and It was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of I mean an old-school
Amsterdam Kind of peppery Yeah It was you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, it's only kind of remind me of the
star dog a little bit but without the
[SPEAKER_01]: chem, you know, but it was kind of peppery
and You know back in the day definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: was a special cut But you know if you put
it up to today's standards, I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: it would really Make the cut in most
people's book but you know if you're more
[SPEAKER_01]: of a nostalgia type of a guy and breeder
like Bob is then you know then yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's something that that's going to
interest you and you know, I think you
[SPEAKER_01]: know a lot of the stuff, you know You know
our our past is our future, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: referencing some of these older cuts and
older strains and You know trying to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: them back Revitalizing them and out
crossing them and you know Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I think you know, you know,
that's what I always say is our past is
[SPEAKER_01]: our future so I'm one of those guys that
kind of like that that looks back on on
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these older strains as They not
might not be significant to most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: people, you know on in today's world It
did mean something at some point for a
[SPEAKER_01]: reason so I still think that there's still
you know a lot of things that could Come
[SPEAKER_01]: out good out of those genetics and
especially something that's different
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to today's designer genetics
Yeah, great rundown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for giving us your answer to that
one one of our listeners asked a really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting question and they were
wondering when you're in the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: creating stardog for example and You maybe
grew out the seeds or they were tested by
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever means Did you find like the
quality and the potency to like surprise
[SPEAKER_00]: you at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think a lot of people would
probably agree You know, they've got to be
[SPEAKER_00]: up there with some of the best and
greatest seeds ever commercially produced
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have any idea like how big it was
going to take off or was it all a bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: surprise?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I was a little bit of surprise I mean,
I I mean I knew like the genetics that I
[SPEAKER_01]: was using were you know, we're special and
so But really they kind of took a life of
[SPEAKER_01]: their own like, you know I like I said,
you know, I when I first popped those
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, you know I don't know how many
maybe four or six seeds I might have
[SPEAKER_01]: popped because you know, I you know back
then You know, I was growing 99 plants for
[SPEAKER_01]: you know Production, you know,
and so 50 would be Vegging and 49 would be
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering So like so if so if I take you
know If I was going to pop, you know four
[SPEAKER_01]: or six seeds that means like four or six
Production plants weren't going to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to be grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wasn't able to you know do huge You
know seed pops for selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I first did that first,
you know seed pop and found the the Cory
[SPEAKER_01]: star dog I was you know, pretty impressed
on you know what it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so once I started to You know get that
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the first few people I gave
it to was was Joe B Because he had given
[SPEAKER_01]: me this chem four So I wanted to give you
know give him, you know something for
[SPEAKER_01]: giving it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, here's the quarry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Once the quarry got out there and
humble it kind of took a life of its own,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know and really started to become
really popular out there and Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean that's really the only way I could
explain it is it kind of took a life of
[SPEAKER_01]: its own, you know and and a lot of these
things happen that way where I might make
[SPEAKER_01]: some something and you know, it takes you
know, and I can test it like I just
[SPEAKER_01]: explained and I knew I had something
really good and started getting you know
[SPEAKER_01]: passing that clone around and until
people, you know got the clone and was
[SPEAKER_01]: able to grow it and finish it and the
people that bought the seeds and bought
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds and were able to grow them and
finish them by the time they get to them
[SPEAKER_01]: and by the time you get a final product
you're talking like a year later,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know by the time I first made it a
year or two later by the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it starts getting into people's
hands starts getting passed around starts
[SPEAKER_01]: making taking a life of its own then I
mean that's you know, so you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's basically like all my work has
always been like that like it's not like
[SPEAKER_01]: me telling you how great it is and you go
in and buying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's people buying it and telling everyone
else how great it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the times that takes it takes
time for that to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, it's happened numerous
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the only way that I can
really explain it to where, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you make something, you know, you can test
it, you know, your friends and all but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really the general public's
perception of what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess it, you know, must have to
have been a little bit surprising but
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I guess great to get that feedback
even if it does have a bit of a lag time
[SPEAKER_00]: before it gets to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I was hoping you could answer
for me was that I think it's undeniable,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, TresDog as a male has made a
number of killer strains out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interestingly enough, we really don't
see a lot of TresDog females out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one which I believe StrayFox has
a cut of one which he really likes and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe another one or two floating around
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you have any thoughts on why maybe
we don't see TresDog as much and how did
[SPEAKER_00]: you find the females?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the reason why that is because we
never, there was never really commercially
[SPEAKER_01]: like released.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some small releases but
generally like that was really made for to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a breeding male.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the times, you know,
I just made, it was just one breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I did the initial Afghan Chem D as
per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most of those seeds were sold on
seed bay and not a lot of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have some of those original Afghan
Chem D seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of that seed stock, I would pop and
find another male and then I did the back
[SPEAKER_01]: cross into the Chem D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it made the double dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the double dog became a little more
accessible and I let some of those seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of those seeds did get out and I
think on seed bay also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think those ones were, I remember
taking a picture of one of my original
[SPEAKER_01]: packs and it was just in a small little
plastic Ziploc baggie with a hand printed
[SPEAKER_01]: pen on the plastic itself there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was no label or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a pen printed on the plastic
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I said double dog and that
was where my original that's how those
[SPEAKER_01]: original packs were sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just unsealed in a little Ziploc
baggie with 10 seed, 10 or 12 seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might've said, you know,
a double dog, 12 seeds on it or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, then, you know, obviously I
took a male out of that and made the trez
[SPEAKER_01]: dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I made the trez dog, that was just
one breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a double dog male and I made like a
certain amount of those seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I still have some of those original
stock of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really at that point, I decided that I
was going to, that was gonna be it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was gonna be, this was gonna be my
male strain, the trez dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was very few seeds that that
we've released that I let go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cause I wanted, you know, cause that
was gonna be, you know, I wanted to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of feedback from it,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, I wanted to be that,
I wanted that to be exclusive from,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was my exclusive strain, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really that's like one of the reasons
why like no one else really has it because
[SPEAKER_01]: we, I never really worked it really past
that, you know, I had given, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've, I have passed some seeds off to
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has made some Chem D back cross threes
and I think some fours, but we've never
[SPEAKER_01]: released them or we've never worked any of
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, you know, we have them for future,
for future use, but yeah, it was never,
[SPEAKER_01]: the trez dog was never intended to be a
production, a seed strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really supposed to be my exclusive
male that, you know, no one else was going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's a brilliant answer as to why
we don't see much trade dog females out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, you know, and really if you
look at it, like, you know, the people now
[SPEAKER_01]: that are copying me and ripping me off,
you know, you know, they could only use
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds made from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they can't get that original seed
stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of segue into the next question
we had, which was from one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners, but I'll admit I too was
interested in this one, uh, sort of along
[SPEAKER_00]: the lines of what you just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the story behind goo from green
point seeds using Stardog?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like I've heard rumors that it
was like your cut exactly, or is it just
[SPEAKER_00]: from your seed stock?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the backstory there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I'm just going back a
little bit when I had my, my legal
[SPEAKER_01]: troubles and my absence of the internet
during, during that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And inception of, um, Instagram,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that was, you were talking like
2014, maybe I think 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I had, you know,
I had, like I mentioned, I had gotten to a
[SPEAKER_01]: jammed up a little bit there and I had to
close down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was absent from the internet for,
for a little bit, a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: But during that time, like unknown to me,
during that time, my stuff was blowing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I had gotten in trouble and I had
kind of dropped out of the scene a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, during that time, I was just
blowing up, you know, my seeds were
[SPEAKER_01]: blowing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were getting really popular,
but we were nowhere to be found.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, and that, that's when,
uh, green point, uh, they had gotten some
[SPEAKER_01]: of my original, uh, star dog stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they decided, you know,
since I wasn't around that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they made some kind of a statement saying
that I was retired and that they were,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, going to further on the genetics
and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this kind of took advantage of,
of the situation and I was kind of down
[SPEAKER_01]: and out at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I, you know, at the time I
kind of, you know, I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I rebelled with some posts and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't really much I could do
because I wasn't growing at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really just really, um,
you know, uh, gave me more incentive to
[SPEAKER_01]: get my shit together and to, and to
really, you know, and, and, and really,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, widen my perspective of the
possibility of this really being,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, something, uh, uh, something because,
you know, back, back then, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the only really big breeders back then
were kind of from Amsterdam, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those were, those guys were only
the real, those guys were really
[SPEAKER_01]: legitimate and, you know, they were,
you know, obviously working under,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uh, easier conditions that we
were.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the thing about,
you know, the difference between,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Dutch breeders and American breeders
is we have so much more passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, you go over to Amsterdam
and, you know, these guys are smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: spliffs with fucking tobacco in it because
the weed is too strong and fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we show up over there and
we're smoking bombs of fucking straight
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking diesel and they're looking like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, we're fucking crazy,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, uh, the Americans have
always had much more passion for,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, for stronger, the strongest weed,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, and, and basically the Dutch
is a, the Dutch have everything they got
[SPEAKER_01]: over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got from us originally,
you know, is just that they were,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, working, you know, not under
prohibition like we were.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really why, the reason why a lot
of those genetics wound up in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in Amsterdam, because they were able to
work there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, you know, so the, the
Americans always had a strong passion for
[SPEAKER_01]: the best of the best, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you know, when, when we,
you know, when I first was coming up and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing, doing what we were doing and doing
what I was doing, you know, I never,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you know, would, you know,
uh, try to compare myself to a Neville or
[SPEAKER_01]: a Sensi Seeds or a Shanti Bob or or any of
these guys, you know, because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they were just that,
you know, such a high level and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we were just, you know,
a bunch of people on the internet just
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to, you know, figure things out
and, you know, make our own way,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak, not knowing that,
you know, the genetics that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: working with were, you know, you know,
some of the best in the whole wide world,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and, you know, it's,
you know, it's just really kind of hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: explain, you know, the reason why that is,
you know, and some of it's just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: pure luck because, you know, we were only
given the stuff that we had access to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so we didn't have access to any
of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never would have been able to have it,
obviously, you know, so, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of places are kind of, you know,
you know, everyone, every place in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world kind of has their own kind of like
home strains that were popular at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time, you know, and that's all that they
know because that's what they grew up
[SPEAKER_01]: around, you know, so, you know,
like, you know, fortunately for us,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the chems were around and,
you know, not knowing that they would be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the strains that they are today,
you know, and going back to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the, you know, the older stuff
that I had seen, the hash plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: the ties and stuff like that, you know,
back then, you know, I didn't really have
[SPEAKER_01]: a really full grasp of the whole genetic
pool, you know, like I do today,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the, you know, the knowledge and
the experience just wasn't there,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so, you know, you see all these
different strains, you know, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, come out of Amsterdam and,
you know, and looking back, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how many of them are still
relevant today in today's world,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when back then they were super
popular, you know, so, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was never, you know, it's hard to
believe that, you know, we've built up,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a genetic diversity in the
States here that just kind of just lead
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, you know, and it's just from
people's passion for the flower itself and
[SPEAKER_01]: for taking risks and just traveling and
just, you know, you know, we, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: stand on the shoulders of giants,
you know, of people that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: initially, you know, went out and took
those risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hugely, hugely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when you were developing the Tres Dog
line, I'm wondering what, how are you
[SPEAKER_00]: making your selection?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you just selecting a male that you
felt best looked like the Chem D sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: each time and what would be your general
tips for listeners who are hoping to get
[SPEAKER_00]: better at selecting males?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, that's really, you know,
pretty much, you know, yeah, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: early on, you know, it was, you know,
and that was really, I guess, the concept
[SPEAKER_01]: of back-crossing, you know, was just
really trying to like tighten up the gene
[SPEAKER_01]: pool, you know, around, you know,
around the Chem D, you know, I've had,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a little bit of breeding
knowledge just from dogs, from pit bulls
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff and I used to study the breeding
lines and how they would, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: do things and how a certain dog would
become a line in itself and how that was
[SPEAKER_01]: done, meaning like a one male,
almost kind of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a strain, you know, like it's the same
thing with cannabis, a strain within a
[SPEAKER_01]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, so I had a little bit of
knowledge of that and a lot of it had to
[SPEAKER_01]: do with, you know, this going back to the
original genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and it's really just a
theory of back-crossing and stuff and also
[SPEAKER_01]: I had read a little bit, you know,
on the Mel Frank stuff and the concept of
[SPEAKER_01]: cubing and back-crossing and cubing and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I thought that would,
you know, be the best way to really just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, try to touch and brighten up the
gene pool of the Chem D.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and so, you know,
initially, you know, I would probably say
[SPEAKER_01]: there was no real selection when I first
took my first, you know, initial male and
[SPEAKER_01]: I just really, you know, it was just
really a donor male and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and just really, that's really the only
thing that was really donating was the
[SPEAKER_01]: male part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because my vision was to just to keep
bringing it back, you know, until,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a certain point and then
testing, you know, not really testing as I
[SPEAKER_01]: went along, you know, in the very
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so, I mean, once, you know,
once I got to, you know, to the trade dog
[SPEAKER_01]: and then that's when I, you know,
because I've used a lot of different males
[SPEAKER_01]: of that and initially, like, I would just,
you know, I had, I would do a breeding and
[SPEAKER_01]: then kill the male, you know, and so,
you know, so really, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and at that point, it really wasn't really
like my vision to continuously breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just because I had a certain clone
at the time that I wanted to preserve.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would just, you know, I would just
pop a new male and do it, bam,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'd go back to production,
you know, and then I'd get another new
[SPEAKER_01]: clone sometime and be like, well,
I don't have to keep a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'll just start a new seed to find
a new male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so that was really,
you know, the way I did it in the very
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning, you know, because I,
you know, I didn't really have a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, breeding experience and I was
just kind of learning as I go along,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, whereas now, you know,
I do a lot more selections on the male and
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for certain characteristics and
kind of like one good example would have
[SPEAKER_01]: been like the trade dog times the sour
diesel, which made the sour dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I did those, when I did that
initial creation, you know, my thing was,
[SPEAKER_01]: all right, you know, I want to produce a
sour diesel, you know, sour diesel line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was quite easy to pick the male for
the next batch because the trade dog,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it grew short, you know,
so any of those short phenos obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: would have been more trade dog leaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I wanted a more sour leaning one,
I was looking for a more stretchier sour
[SPEAKER_01]: leaning type of structure, you know,
so, you know, that's one way of doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: is like, you get two different opposite of
the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a tall plant and a short plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you want to breed for the tall
plant, but you use a short plant for the
[SPEAKER_01]: male donor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so you do that initial cross and
then just select for the tall plants going
[SPEAKER_01]: there, there onward after.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and then, you know,
you know, then there's another way of
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it where you actually grow out your
males and females.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, you see that the male
or the female that you like, and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: try to pick a male that's that grows
similar to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, so you would be like,
all right, you know, these things both
[SPEAKER_01]: look same, one's a male, one's a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you would know that that
male would kind of show the same
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics as that female,
but that's doing a little bit more work,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and that's really something that
people don't want to do nowadays,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and this is one of the things
that kind of makes me mad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not that, you know, I don't get
mad that people use my genetics and out
[SPEAKER_01]: cross them to other things, you know,
which I don't have no problem with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I don't get mad that people
are, you know, they cross, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they are going to, they want to work with
the chem dog or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they're going to work with the chem
dog or whatever, well, why don't you use,
[SPEAKER_01]: make your own male, use your own genetics,
your own out cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they want to do is they just want to
take my stuff that I work and cross it
[SPEAKER_01]: into a chem and make it their chem instead
of going and getting their own Afghan,
[SPEAKER_01]: their own Hindu Kush or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They out cross that they want to do,
make their own male, do all that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and a lot of that takes a
lot of time, you know, and that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: people do not want to do nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want to steal people's work,
make a quick cross, put it on Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: and try to make a quick buck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and so a lot of people,
they'll sell their stuff for half your
[SPEAKER_01]: price or whatever $50 a pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm selling my stuff for
double or triple that price because I put
[SPEAKER_01]: that amount of work in, I have years of
work in that cross and someone just takes
[SPEAKER_01]: that now and F twos it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so that's the stuff that I
don't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people want to take my stuff and out
cross it and use it for something
[SPEAKER_01]: different, I mean, I'm happy that they do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the people that just want
to, you know, kind of pray off for your
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then there's always the
argument, well, if you don't like it,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't sell regular seeds or once you sell
them then, you know, so there's all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different arguments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, just really on how you want
to, you know, conduct yourself and be
[SPEAKER_01]: known as, you know, if you want to be one
of those people and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's always going to be people that are
going to support them because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, some people, you know,
they just want to buy cheap seeds or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just like, you know,
going back to, you know, the rez dog
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, there's always going to be someone
out there that's going to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to support them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same thing with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's people that are always
going to support you and there's always
[SPEAKER_01]: going to people that are going to hate
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one thing that you got to come
to grips with no matter who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can think of anything in the world,
the best singer, the best soccer star,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always going to be someone that's
going to be like, you know, I don't like
[SPEAKER_01]: that person because of this or that or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could live with that just as long as you
have more people that support you than
[SPEAKER_01]: that don't like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some wise words right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was interesting about that answer was
how you are mentioning that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, each sort of breeding is like
its own unique offering because it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using the mail like one time only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that still the case or have you been
keeping mails more lately?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I keep mails now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of our last, you know,
I kind of learned because one of the trade
[SPEAKER_01]: dog, one of the last ones I used was one
of the purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: We called the purple, you know,
and that one, you know, everything that
[SPEAKER_01]: that was that mail was bred to came out
kind of purplish.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the sour dog, the original New York
City diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a few other strains,
too, that came out like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so after that, yeah, you know,
after that, you know, I decided that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's better for me to try to
keep one mail and to keep reusing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, since I'm not, you know,
growing for production anymore,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that, you know, that whole formula now
is, you know, is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, it's more about the amount of
different strains that I have and just the
[SPEAKER_01]: overall plant count overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I'm able to keep a lot more
different type of phenols.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think right now I have, I don't know,
maybe like four or five different mails
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm sitting on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be sort of relaxing nowadays that
you're able to do that as opposed to in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past, where it was maybe a bit more
harder to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another question we got from one of
our listeners was, how would you describe
[SPEAKER_00]: Stardog for someone who's never been able
to try it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it's got like, it's kind of
a, it's kind of piney, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cammy,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, it's very unique, you know,
and yeah, I mean, it's kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really a good blend between the Chem
4 and the Chem D, you know, so,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's a little bit of like
piney dirtiness in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's really what I'm looking
for, a piney dirtiness in a Chem D.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's kind of almost a layered,
a little bit of a layered palette.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really one of the things about
the Chems, because, you know, you can
[SPEAKER_01]: cross a Chem into something that's terpy
and still retain those terps and get like
[SPEAKER_01]: a Chem, a layered Chem flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that's really, you know,
what a lot of people, that are really into
[SPEAKER_01]: terps are looking for is like,
you know, you get that layered flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're getting multiple different
flavors in one hit, where you could taste
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem, you could taste pine, you could
taste fruit or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what makes a lot of these
strains really unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it sounds delicious, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was a bit of a cheeky segue
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as I'm sure you're pretty well
aware, Stardog has really become a major
[SPEAKER_00]: player in the UK scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's almost like it's the new
cheese in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm just sort of wondering,
like, how does it feel to have a strain
[SPEAKER_00]: that's become that critically acclaimed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, there are people who have had
popular strains, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're at that point, it's really to
a different magnitude, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's kind of funny because like,
you know, I don't really, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been to the UK once, you know,
for a brief time, so I haven't really
[SPEAKER_01]: spent a lot of time there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, it's really the people
of the UK that's kind of blown that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, someone, you know, wound up
getting some seeds and some cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget what is the cutting, the popular
cutting that was over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's someone's name I'm trying and it's a
particular type of cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, so, you know, I mean,
I just finding it's amazing, you know what
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just unbelievable, you know,
because, you know, it's just something
[SPEAKER_01]: that just took a life of its own,
you know, like it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just really hard to explain because,
you know, I didn't really have anything
[SPEAKER_01]: personally to do with that, you know,
like, you know, I sold the seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: somehow they got into the hands of someone
over there and it just took a life of its
[SPEAKER_01]: own.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, you know, and I know this has
been going on for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at least five or six years now,
you know, I've been hearing this and that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the star dog has just,
you know, taking over, has taking over the
[SPEAKER_01]: cheese as the most, you know, popular
commercial strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot of people, you know,
telling me how good it is and I have a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people telling me how bad it is because
it's being so commercially grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and some of it, they don't even know
if it's really the star dog or someone
[SPEAKER_01]: just putting the name star dog on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, like I said, it's just amazing
because it's nothing that I, that I can,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't take claim to that because someone
else did that and, you know, just going
[SPEAKER_01]: back to when something's that good,
that it just takes its life of its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't really say anything else other
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get some kudos, I think,
but I quickly Googled the name of it and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's called Manny's Cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Manny's Cut, correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Manny's Cut, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the more popular,
I think that's the most popular one I've
[SPEAKER_01]: heard of the Manny's Cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not familiar with the Manny's Cut
and I don't know anything about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, it's made a name for itself,
whoever Manny is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, hopefully if you ever head back,
someone will have a bag waiting for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But onto another sort of international
based question, a few different fans
[SPEAKER_00]: actually asked me to try to find out from
you, what's the, can you give us the
[SPEAKER_00]: lowdown on the Top Dog Thailand Endeavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think people have been
following it and are like, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: this seems very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's the backstory behind all of
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, yeah, I mean, we're really
interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always been really interested in,
in, in Thai weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I had, and I told you the story
of my experience with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, that's always kind of,
stuck with me, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, once we, you know,
I started seeing that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were, you know, starting a medical
thing and, you know, they were,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so we, you know, we,
we decided, you know, that we were,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, wanted to, you know,
to try to get more information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they actually had a, I'm trying to
think, what's the name of it now,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they had a CBD show in Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we decided to,
to go there and, and, and check it out,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and, and, you know, make new
contacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and so, a friend of mine,
me and a friend of mine, he's a Pantagru
[SPEAKER_01]: lion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was the one that actually,
gave me the, that Sensi store cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we decided to, you know,
take a trip over there and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: get our feet wet, see what, you know,
see if we could get into the market
[SPEAKER_01]: somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, we went over there and we were
able to, you know, establish some
[SPEAKER_01]: contacts, you know, start getting some
information and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my friend stayed over there for,
he stayed over there for a few months,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, he wound up going up into Chiang
Mai and visited a few farms and grows and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, and started collecting seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, really, you know, we decided that,
you know, we wanted to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: try to, on one end, try to start
collecting land-raised seed and try to
[SPEAKER_01]: start exploring some of the mythical Thai
stick strains that have been, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the ones that I have
experienced from personal, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: from, from myself experience, personal
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we want to try to find some
of these strains and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: bring them, you know, back to,
you know, the forefront.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because these things were,
you know, very, they have a place in
[SPEAKER_01]: history and for a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, a lot of that,
you know, we're finding out a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different things about, you know,
the Thai stick, a lot of it had to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: the curing process and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, as well as long with the strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, we want to, so that was one end
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is we wanted to, you know, bring back the
lore of the indigenous, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: land-raised strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the other hand, we wanted to
bring them up to speed with modern
[SPEAKER_01]: technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, from what, you know,
we experienced, there seemed to be a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Dutch seed companies are trying to
make influence over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think that we're better.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that we're better than the Dutch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, we want to make sure that Thailand
is going to be having, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the best strains available from America
and not get bamboozled by the Dutch
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're being targeted,
because they're an upstart, an upstart
[SPEAKER_01]: country.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know the difference between a
lot of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we want to educate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also, you know, we want to bring,
you know, modern medical standards there
[SPEAKER_01]: and as in testing and all of that,
you know, because, you know, they want to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, have a medical CBD program over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're having problems with strains over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of them, a lot of the
strains can't grow well over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not testing for CBD, high,
you know, a lot of them are got THC in
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there's a lot of stuff that,
you know, they're really on the ground
[SPEAKER_01]: level of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, they need to be shown,
you know, the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully, you know, we can help
influence them to, you know, to do things
[SPEAKER_01]: in the correct way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think, you know, there's,
you know, a huge, you know, they,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, of Asia because no one in Asia
is really, you know, taking the forefront
[SPEAKER_01]: for medical over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that China has some type of thing
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, in Asia itself,
I mean, Korea, South Korea, Japan,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's, you know, a lot of
neighboring countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I see, you know,
the prospect of, you know, of a lot of a
[SPEAKER_01]: good, you know, economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a lot of tourists over there
that, you know, so, you know, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about a future letting tourists
by, you know, cannabis or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so, you know, I see, you know,
a lot of future prospects there possibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we want to get in on the ground floor
on some of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, have some influence around the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I never really thought about the
Dutch getting into those markets,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it makes sense that they would be in
there nice and early trying to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: jump the gun on people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, the funny thing was I sat,
we sat in on a, you know, they did a
[SPEAKER_01]: discussion and stuff presentation and they
showed like all their target markets
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the funny thing was the number one
target market was excluded, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why wouldn't you want to target America
because you're irrelevant in the market as
[SPEAKER_01]: it is now, as most, you know, Dutch
companies are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, I mean, so now they have to go
into all these upstart countries to where
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't know any better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that it was purely just the
change in laws, which led to sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: decline of Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that it's maybe just,
you know, more factors than just that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of it, but I don't think,
I mean, their breeding techniques and
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge were, you know, very bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they were breeding for all the
wrong things, early finishers,
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy yielders, orange hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so after years and years of
bottlenecking and crossing the same things
[SPEAKER_01]: into the same things, into the same
things, you get what you got today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, it's a tough situation if
you're growing with Amsterdam genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping to get a good outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at one time they were the best in
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, if you go back to,
you know, the, the, the, the, the late
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville days, you know, and, uh,
and, and I say, you know, uh, the late
[SPEAKER_01]: eighties, 88, 89, 90, uh, and then going
into the sensey seed and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: probably good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up until about 95 or anything from sensey
seeds that had the original cellophane
[SPEAKER_01]: card pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was to see through cellophane with just
a card in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you had your, your, you used to
be able to get, I think it was 15 or 16
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds that they gave you originally in
that cellophane pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just had the card in it with the
Northern lights on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you would flip it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so, uh, and then, uh,
probably the lat the last best thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: they did was the Jack career, the original
Jack career.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I think that was what like 94,
95, somewhere in the mid nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was kind of after that,
that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they had changed, they changed their
packaging shortly after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the, the, the product was never
the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a friend that went out and got some
of the original Jack career in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cellophane pack and he brought it back and
he, he grew it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember it was like a 77 day plant,
but it used to, I mean, the, the top buds
[SPEAKER_01]: were your forearms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a heavy yielder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a really nice, um, hazy tip to it,
you know, but it was kind of, it wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: super strong or nothing, but it was,
it was really nice, like the original Jack
[SPEAKER_01]: career cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so, I mean, these guys,
uh, once they found out, it started to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce and they just started pumping it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, I mean, they just started over
producing it and I was like, Whoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, hold on now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting overburdened with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not moving anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, we got to cut it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, you know, I told them we can't
do this anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're like, all right, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, we have the rest of the pack of
seeds that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, all right, kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a few days, a few years down the road,
I'm like, Hey, why don't you, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: find that pack of Jack career and get that
going again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I can't find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that time I was doing the seed bay
thing and getting, getting the seed
[SPEAKER_01]: credits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, I'll get you another pack
of the Jack career.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got them the new, I got them in the
new packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was in, uh, it was in the
bubble and the box and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I give them, you know, a pack of
the Jack career and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, looking forward to him finishing out,
you know, he finishes it out, shows me the
[SPEAKER_01]: final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just so disappointing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just was nothing like the original.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a stringy fucking bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just so disappointing and just,
yeah, I mean, and really, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: to sum it up, that's kinda, you know,
how I feel about most Dutch genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are a few exceptions karma
and a few other guys that are out there
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the real thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, any of the old original
guys are just pretty much just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, going through the fucking,
you know, emotions and just producing
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, you know, for pretty much for
souvenir purposes, because they're really
[SPEAKER_01]: not worth much more than, you know,
the packaging itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I wouldn't, you know,
I mean, what, what seed, what,
[SPEAKER_01]: what, what strains of greenhouse are
relevant in today's, uh, on, on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you can go down the whole list
of all of them and, you know, what's
[SPEAKER_01]: relevant today and really a lot of,
of them are offering American genetics now
[SPEAKER_01]: and branding themselves such as.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Barney's farm have just come out
with like gelato wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well, interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to bring the focus back to the U
S, um, you know, the cannabis climate
[SPEAKER_00]: around the, sorry, the legal climate
around cannabis in the U S has been a sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of changing landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a bit of a sentiment nowadays
that, uh, both legally and financially,
[SPEAKER_00]: California is just starting to push
growers out of the market and even out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on the legal climate
in the U S and how do you feel about some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the newer places opening up and
becoming the hotspot, like say Oklahoma?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, I got kind of mixed feelings on
some of it because a lot of it is just
[SPEAKER_01]: geared towards money and corporate like,
like, like California, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, if you were a small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mom and pop operation, you know,
uh, they just make it so difficult for you
[SPEAKER_01]: to operate that it's just not feasible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the licensing costs,
the process of getting a license,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, a lot of places you have to secure a
location to get a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means you're, you're, you're going
to be renting out, um, a warehouse
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly for a year or two, even before
you could even start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, working there, you know, so,
uh, the, the, the, the startup cost on,
[SPEAKER_01]: on, on some of these, it's just,
it's just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have it set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so it favors, uh, big money in
corporations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, on the other hand, you know,
you have States like, um, Oklahoma and
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon where anyone with 3000 dollars can
go and set up shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, uh, there's not a lot of
money in those States, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so, um, what's going to happen in Oklahoma
is, you know, is the same thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: happened in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, once they got up into full
speed, full production, then license,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have 10,000 people that
are producing and trying to sell weed on
[SPEAKER_01]: the same spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, how many, you know, as far as I
know, Oregon and Oklahoma, any type of
[SPEAKER_01]: tourist attraction, um, the, the,
the, uh, household income is probably very
[SPEAKER_01]: low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're really stuck in a market where
it's oversaturated.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of money and everyone's
fighting over the same nickel,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, I mean, it's kind of fucked
up, you know, because they, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uh, the same thing in,
you know, is happening in New Jersey now
[SPEAKER_01]: and in New York, you know, they,
they, you know, they say they want to open
[SPEAKER_01]: it up for, you know, um, people that,
you know, it's been affected by the drug
[SPEAKER_01]: war and this and that, you know,
and then they start making up all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you got to be a resident for
three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: All your money's got to be in the bank for
three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, uh, and then you got towns,
uh, you know, uh, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a town that, um, we don't want,
we don't want a wreck in our town.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not, you know, we're not going to
allow it, or we're going to allow for
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses and, you know, the people with
political connections and money and who,
[SPEAKER_01]: or who knows how that licensing process is
going to be, how, how that's going to go
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, yeah, so a lot of people a lot
of people, uh, get, get, get shut out and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, even, you know, someone like
myself and who some may say has got some
[SPEAKER_01]: type of reputation or, or whatever you may
think in the game, you know, it really
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't mean shit to a lot of these
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, uh, you know, a lot of these
people are only interested in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in, uh, these are corporate people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, and they're only the only
thing they know how to do is count money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the, the, the corporate
structure is, Hey, if we made 10,000,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, 10 million this year, and we only make
8 million next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we lost 2 million in their eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, uh, I see it as more of a
commodity, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really going to be interesting on
how, you know, um, this all plays out
[SPEAKER_01]: because the way that I see it is if you
can't get in now, you ain't going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: in later, you know, and that's kind of
like what's happened here in Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: because, um, in the early days of medical,
uh, just anyone could have just gotten set
[SPEAKER_01]: up anywhere, you know, and then you know,
they, they, uh, you know, they brought rec
[SPEAKER_01]: down and, you know, they, uh, they made a
lot of rules and they forced a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people out for different reasons,
you know, uh, and then they can do it
[SPEAKER_01]: through zoning and through, you know,
if you have, uh, uh, a record and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: just a lot of these different things,
you know, that, that, that they do to,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, uh, to, to make it, make it,
you know, virtually impossible for a small
[SPEAKER_01]: time operator to get into it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, you know, really, uh,
geared towards big money.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these states seem, and,
and, and those are the states that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that have the money, you know,
that you will be able to make,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, some type of a profit,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the, the, the startup
costs, or in the millions, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, we, we are working class
people, most of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if we had millions of
dollars, quite frankly, we wouldn't be who
[SPEAKER_01]: we are now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there's a, you know,
there's a big gap in between, between,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uh, reality and perception and,
uh, you know, what people think the market
[SPEAKER_01]: is, is going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a sentiment I've heard expressed a
little bit more recently is that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of growing suspicion that national
legalization may not be too far off the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see that being a possibility?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, it's really politics and,
you know, unfortunately, politics in
[SPEAKER_01]: America is, is really fucked up right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's really, uh,
kind of like two parties, the Democrats
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Republicans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, most of the Republicans
don't favor cannabis legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the states that aren't legal are
run by Republicans.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that being said, our president is a
Democrat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at first it seemed like he was
signaling towards legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it seems like he's signaling
against federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, it's kind of caught in
the middle because originally,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, the drug war was started by executive
order by Richard Nixon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The president, and it could be ended by
executive order by the president Biden,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you wanted to, but no one seems,
and it could have been done by every other
[SPEAKER_01]: president in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, you know, I don't see them
doing it unless it's beneficial for them
[SPEAKER_01]: somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, for them to just keep things at
status quo kind of, you know, kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: protects them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of like the same kind of
issue of, of the immigration issue that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have here where they just, it's fucked up,
but they don't want to, they don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want to keep it the way that it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, go, and then the only
other way to change it is by an act of
[SPEAKER_01]: Congress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to do it by act of
Congress, then you need Republicans to get
[SPEAKER_01]: on board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the, the politics in this
country are so polarizing that it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's like living in two
different worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels very tense, very polarized at the
moment, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to ask all guests, what would be
some advice you would give to someone
[SPEAKER_00]: who's maybe hoping to start breeding maybe
now, maybe down the track?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think some good advice you'd
give to someone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, try to do something original,
you know, um, you can't really,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to make your own way and not
really ride off the coattails of other
[SPEAKER_01]: people's success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which you can in, in a certain way,
you know, if you do it the right way,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you want to do it in a way of creating
something new, not copying what's
[SPEAKER_01]: something old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could take something that's popular
and new and cross it into something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: totally different and possibly come up
with something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, uh, yeah, I mean, that's really,
you know, really the thing is just to try
[SPEAKER_01]: to be original, you know, and,
you know, like I say, you're our past is
[SPEAKER_01]: our future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people only look at the
status quo of what's popular today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm the kind of guy that want to
go back into land races, go back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: original store of things and start from
there, you know, start over again,
[SPEAKER_01]: or use that into some of the stuff that
into some of the new modern stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uh, the key is to create new and
not really try to, uh, replicate what is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some great advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you just referenced wanting to
dig into some land race stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed on your Instagram, you'd post
some Afghani seeds recently, and it made
[SPEAKER_00]: me wonder, are these some of the stocks
you might be looking to work with and what
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of land races in general would you
want to work with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, right now there seems to be a big,
um, search for a roadkill skunk,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so, you know, in my opinion,
you know, that's going to be found in some
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghan strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, you know, looking back on the
history of it all, uh, yeah, that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you really got to start,
you know, so, you know, um, really,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just like, you know,
like I was saying, you know, about the HP
[SPEAKER_01]: 13 and that land race strain, uh,
yeah, you have to, you have to go out and
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to, uh, search for stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to try new stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, you got to, you know,
do stuff that people aren't doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how you find stuff that's
special and unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you, you, you know, you find
something that's different and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uh, you just, you know,
you, you, you, you start, you start from
[SPEAKER_01]: there and start working off of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a step-by-step process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, really, um, you know,
with the amount of land race stuff that's
[SPEAKER_01]: available today, you know, there's Indian
stuff, uh, Hindu Kush, uh, Afghan,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and that's really, you know,
the base of, you know, all of the genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have today, you know, is just that
people, you know, they're, they're,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're too lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to put in the work,
you know, a lot of it takes a lot of time
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of effort, a lot of,
a lot of time you're, you're, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're, you're wasting your time,
a lot of wasted time, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so, you know, people don't want to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want to do what's easiest for
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just, it's easier to rip off someone
else's stuff and do, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: do some, some kind of cross like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so, you know, that's really kind
of what's separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people that lead, you know,
uh, compared to people that follow,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you're a, if you're a leader,
you're going to go out there and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to find your own stuff, you know,
one way or the other, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so much stuff out there,
you know, you just got to go out there and
[SPEAKER_01]: find it and, um, and yeah, and just grow
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I tell people to pop seeds,
you know, I mean, pop, keep popping seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cause that's where the next best
clone is going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Found obviously, you know, and where's
that going to, where's that seed going to
[SPEAKER_01]: come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that could be come from anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that's, that's, that's the
joy and the anticipation that you get when
[SPEAKER_01]: you pop something new, because you want to
see, you know, what, what it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and as in, especially if you
made it yourself, you know, then it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, then you have that much more
pride to put into it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you're just really, really
searching for something, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you just got to try to, you know,
um, come up with a game plan and just,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, have an idea on,
you know, what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of like what I'm saying about
this roadkill skunk stuff for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm searching for it and,
you know, I'm just going to have to try
[SPEAKER_01]: popping different land race Afghanis,
you know, until I can find something
[SPEAKER_01]: that's similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you may find the next chem
something fuely or you don't know what
[SPEAKER_01]: could come out of some of this stuff,
because you know, that's been the
[SPEAKER_01]: foundation for all this stuff that we've,
we've, we've had for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you know, there's been a lot of,
um, um, unstable situations over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, um, you know, I don't know,
you know, um, you know, how, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's affected, you know, uh,
indigenous, uh, farmer generational
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers who, who traditionally farm from
seed crop, the seed crop, the seed crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: the seed crop and produce hash from those
seeds, you know, from that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that hash actually is what,
uh, provides for their family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there was always great
family pride in their prop, in the product
[SPEAKER_01]: and production and the product that they
would bring out because that's what kept
[SPEAKER_01]: their family alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was something that was always kept
in the family generation after generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after you break that cycle,
you know, where are you then?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, after all the, you know,
the fighting and, and all this stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the years, you know,
um, you just got to think to yourself,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how much has that affected some
of those indigenous strains and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and, and, and, and, and has some of
them been lost forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that can just, you know,
you can just look back at the seed
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the hash production and how that
is, because that's how that, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what all of that at the end,
you know, produces the hash and
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghanistan was always known as the one of
the best hash producing countries in the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it became that into
becoming just a commercial grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there's a lot, you know,
unless you're, you know, on, on the ground
[SPEAKER_01]: and got intimate knowledge of the region
and, you know, and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, um, which people do,
you know, there's a lot of English people
[SPEAKER_01]: that are able to, you know, that are
Afghani and Muslim and are able to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, travel back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the country, to the homeland,
where if you and I went there and they
[SPEAKER_01]: seen our white asses, they would behead
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you know, uh, for us traveling
into those regions would be, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, very dangerous and, you know,
and something that I wouldn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't want to do, you know,
but, you know, uh, I, I believe that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, those genetics are possibly
still out there, but you got to go out
[SPEAKER_01]: there and get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A comprehensive answer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we're on the topic of,
you know, advocating for popping seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we always do, I'd like to know how
many seeds do you pop when you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: to search through a line to try to figure
out what's inside it?
[SPEAKER_01]: As many as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, you know, it's kind of hard,
you know, um, you know, when you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: working, you know, uh, not in a commercial
facility, so, uh, you know, you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: pick and choose, you know, kind of,
um, the direction on what projects you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, space is always a concern,
uh, because I mean, obviously,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, uh, you just can't,
you know, there's just not enough room for
[SPEAKER_01]: all plants, but, um, like right now,
um, I'm popping, um, some sour diesel BX
[SPEAKER_01]: three F twos, and I think I got about 20
of them going right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, ideally I would like to do
a lot more than 20, but that's probably
[SPEAKER_01]: about the limit that I could do in,
uh, in, in the confines of the space that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working, working with now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, when we, um, we're doing
these big, uh, Fino seed hunts in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the warehouse, you know, we're popping
200, a hundred, you know, uh, we're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: a big, um, big seed pops and Fino hunts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like I explained earlier,
most of that is for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, for hash and for flower production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, luckily I'm able to,
um, um, work with some of those selections
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, that we're working,
uh, out of the, um, warehouse with,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um, me personally, you know,
uh, when I'm doing the seed thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I explained earlier, I'm doing about
20 of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so what I'll probably wind up doing is
running them, um, selecting, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or two possibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, breeding them, I would cross
them and then I would, um, find the,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, the, the Fino that I thought best
resembled the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those would be my next generation
of seeds that I would work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you've put in many of the blanks I
had there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A question we got from, um, one of our
listeners is, can you tell us a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about the bubble gum chem that you used to
have and have used in the past?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the, the bubble gum chem, uh,
originally was a tree dog bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, that was the original cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I had gotten the bubble gum cutting,
but I don't even remember where I
[SPEAKER_01]: originally got it from, but yeah,
it was definitely the real deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bubble gum, uh, fruity, uh,
really a crystal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, it was, it was, it was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, uh, I brought it out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a friend of mine, motive, um,
I gave him some seeds and he did some F2
[SPEAKER_01]: work with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me some of those seeds back,
which I, uh, which I sold some of them and
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I haven't really done much other than,
uh, other than that with the, with the
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble gum chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I do remember seeing some of those
F2s on his page as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all ties together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't really a strain that I
really plan on working.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was like one of the things
where I'd explained earlier where I got in
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the, the cutting and I just wanted to
make a, a cross with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I pretty much, that's what I did with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and that's, and, and so that's
what I do a lot of times, whereas a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: times I will have a breeding, um,
direction that I'm going with,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak with like the sour diesel,
like I explained, but if I have a sour
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel mail that I'm using to further that
line, and then I have a bunch of clone
[SPEAKER_01]: only.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I have ready to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll throw the clone onlys in with that,
with that breeding and do a one time
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sometimes those breedings are,
um, you know, they're just one time deals,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like what you were talking about
the OG skunk or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nothing that I really kind of,
um, was going to further.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of a pile and chuck one time
deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times the, uh, some of these
things, uh, take a life of their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes people find some really
special things on some, in some of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, yeah, you know, you know,
it was just something that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I did at the time and it was nothing that
I really intended to work any further than
[SPEAKER_01]: what it was, uh, kind of like what Bodie
does.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does a lot of one time pile and chuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I, I, I do some of that
stuff, but then on the other hand,
[SPEAKER_01]: I do do a directional, uh, line breeding
in, in, in a place where I want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little bit of a combination of
the both, the way I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so would you ever consider doing any
feminized breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I mean, I've kind of thought about it
and.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and really getting back to the
initial reason why I started breeding was
[SPEAKER_01]: for preservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you can't really have
preservation and, um, without a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can, I guess, go from S one to
S, you know, keep asking all the way up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, it's always been about the
evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess of, of the plant itself and to do
breeding that's going to further the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic pool, uh, in time, if,
you know, kind of like bettering each,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're trying to do something better each
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in theory, over a period of time,
you should have something that's you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that, that's evolved into a superior
product, so to speak, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I guess, I guess that would really,
we really be talking genetic, genetically,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, where we're over a period of
time that, that, yeah, you would have
[SPEAKER_01]: something that would be superior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I forgot to ask you earlier,
but I would be really interested in your
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective on was.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your first impression of OG?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm imagining you were probably
growing chem at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden OG came out,
you know, did that sort of change the game
[SPEAKER_00]: for you or was it still business as usual?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, well, it was kind of business as usual
for, for us because, uh, it wasn't readily
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was something I could
definitely appreciate it and wanted,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I mean, we just didn't, we didn't have
access to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think like the first time I
was able to get it, I was able to get like
[SPEAKER_01]: an ounce or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was really tightly held,
like anything really good back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to really get like full general access
to something like that was just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kind of impossible because it
was just locked, you know, it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: held down and locked down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so tightly that it just would,
wasn't, you know, wasn't readily
[SPEAKER_01]: available, but you know, I, I mean,
as a connoisseur, I thought it was
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, give me, give me more of
it, give me more of it.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes me sort of wonder on that
same sort of vein before you guys had chem
[SPEAKER_00]: dog, what, in your opinion, was the best
smoke on the East coast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, we're really kind of,
you know, going back into, there wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really a lot of named streams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then, you know, like anything that
you would get from Amsterdam would be
[SPEAKER_01]: considered something super exotic,
early pearls, the early skunks,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, silver pearls, uh, the, I forget
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a couple of other ones and,
um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, back then we thought that was
the shit because we just, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we just never saw something like that
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really, I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean, there was a whole bunch of different
things that were around, but not one
[SPEAKER_01]: particular thing that I could be like,
you know, cause you know, something would,
[SPEAKER_01]: something great would, would come around
and then it would disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because the thing was,
there wasn't a steady, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: flow of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of stuff that was kind of,
you know, kind of, you know, this stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: got smuggled in and like it made it
through one time and that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, unless it was being locally
produced, you know, once, once we started
[SPEAKER_01]: locally producing everything, then things
became more production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when things were being smuggled in,
it was just hit or miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would be your recommendation of
one of the top dog strains for a more
[SPEAKER_00]: newbie grower and also what's your
personal favorite strain you've ever made?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, well, right now, what I have
available, like right now, the dirty taxi
[SPEAKER_01]: seems to be really popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're really looking for a really
kind of a dirty chem kind of chem D,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, kind of a tip, uh, that's what I would
recommend the dirty taxi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we have a lot of different stuff out
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's been selling out the,
the sour diesel back cross fours,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously has been really popular,
really good representations, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: of the sour diesel, uh, money has just,
you know, made some new I 95, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I X's off of his keeper mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so they've been flying off the shelf,
um, the pith, the black pith.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so really, it really depends on your
own personal taste and what you're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, I've tried to,
you know, cover, you know, all the bases
[SPEAKER_01]: of, you know, a lot of my, uh,
personal favorites and try to give people
[SPEAKER_01]: some kind of a representation of that,
you know, so, you know, a lot of it really
[SPEAKER_01]: comes down to your own personal stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have, uh, you know,
like the, the I 95 stuff is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of OG stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've kind of tried to take in a
little bit of the best of everything in
[SPEAKER_01]: some type of form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, so, so yeah, I mean, it's,
you know, a lot of it comes down to
[SPEAKER_01]: personal preference, but, but,
you know, like, like I was going to,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, like the star dog, you know,
you know, you know, for a first time,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, can't go with the star dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, there's no seeds currently
available, but the good thing is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that, uh, there's going to be,
uh, they're going to be harvested soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just did a remake of the star dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did, uh, yeah, the Corey Haim in cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we did the guava in cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we did the, um, original New York city
diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was the three cams,
which was a re one of, uh, a really,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, popular strain, which, you know,
w which was originally kind of a pile and
[SPEAKER_01]: Chuck, which, you know, uh, you know,
cause we just had the original New York
[SPEAKER_01]: city diesel and, uh, you know,
cross to the star dog and not really
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking, you know, uh, it would be as,
you know, as popular it was because,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, basically you got all three
cams in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got, you got the tree dog,
which is chem, you know, chem 90,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, chem D, you know, and then you got
that cross to the chem four and then,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you got trade dog, uh, uh,
trade dog 91 in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a good blend of a four 91 and,
um, chem D in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, that was, you know,
another good one, the three cams that will
[SPEAKER_01]: be, uh, which is being remade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You brought it up because I always saw
that three cams and thought that looked
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, kudos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also brought up I-95, which is an
incredible strain in its own right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you see some people who
have got some pretty wickedly devotion to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever anticipate the I-95 would
become such a success and what was sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: the background on its inception?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it come to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, that was, that was a
money, Mike creation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, I believe we,
we made that in like 2014, 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we brought some seeds out here to,
uh, Colorado and we had, uh, gifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: We originally gifted some to Tara Rojo,
uh, who, who was working in, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: working for mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he was the chief of staff at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we gave him some and, uh,
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then we, we, that was the
original, uh, release of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that original cross was star dog,
uh, legend.
[SPEAKER_01]: OG was the male times, uh, to the triangle
Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I mean, I don't know what that
combination did, but it just really opened
[SPEAKER_01]: up a new box of the way that, I mean,
the way the crystals and the formation of
[SPEAKER_01]: the buds and everything, it just really
gave it hybrid vigor is really what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, because what really came out of
it, really, you couldn't find in any of
[SPEAKER_01]: the parents by themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I mean, it's really got kind of
an OG tip to it, and it's got that
[SPEAKER_01]: stretchiness to it, but it's got more of a
cheminess, I guess, as a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: body and stuff to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the indigo of the star dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very, very unique special
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, a lot of people have tried to
copy it and tried to make it as their own,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was never really put into full
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was releases of it, but it was
never really commercially released across
[SPEAKER_01]: the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the packs that were released,
people were just finding such phenomenal
[SPEAKER_01]: phenos out of it that the strain kind of
just took a life of its own once again,
[SPEAKER_01]: and people just started blowing it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably been more copied,
I'd say, probably than the star dog,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the star dog was more readily
commercially available in releases,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas the I-95 really wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had that initial release of it,
like I said, in 2014, 2015, and then it
[SPEAKER_01]: wound up blowing up over the first few
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we really didn't really realize
the magnitude of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had a limited amount of original
stock that he released, but I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that he still has quite a bit of that
original stock that he's sitting on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, he's just recently done a remake
of that from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, is this something that,
once again, one of our strains just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's what other people did with them and
made them popular, because we never really
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of pushed, we don't really push any
of our strains on people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like we release them, and people buy
them, and then they decide how good they
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the questions I was interested
in asking you was, the chem genetics in
[SPEAKER_00]: general are sort of thought of as having
some degree of sensitivity to stress and
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat prone to a little bit of
instability if they're stressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're breeding with it, do you just
have to accept that there will be a small
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of instability to a degree,
or do you believe it's possible to make
[SPEAKER_00]: chem hybrids that are, say, as stable as
any other strain, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think a lot of that sensitivity
stays present.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it depends on the conditions of
the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you have unstable conditions
in a grow, then yeah, that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: affect some of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the genetics are really
sensitive, like the sour diesel and the
[SPEAKER_01]: 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even some of the cushions,
you could say that about the same things
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all about environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think cannabis adapts to
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if it's in an environment where
it's going to be stress and it thinks it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to die, obviously, it's going to go
into self-preservation and start to herm
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that can be true.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true with any strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's a built-in mechanism
that's in cannabis regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, some strains are going to be a
little more sensitive than other strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, in the end, what's key is
having a stable environment, not having
[SPEAKER_01]: light leaks, not having big temperature
swings, having your pH right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of little different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go down a list of things that
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens is people have an
unstable environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pop a packet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like half the pack turned male and
the other pack hermied on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your genetics suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I get that all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've argued and I've fought with these
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I just reached the point where
I'll just give you a new pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it really comes down to breeder
error.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a grower error, a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're quick to point the finger at
the breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll say, well, I had a pack of
your stuff and a pack of another stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other pack didn't herm,
but your pack did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's just so many variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are in cannabis itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you add that to the variables of
the conditions it grows in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just don't know what it's going to
turn into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, it starts with the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a stable environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have everything that's tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you shouldn't really have too many
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you're using sensitive genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's always going to be those cases
where something's going to herm out
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the genetics or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to do your homework on the
people that you're going to be buying
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds from.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of reputation do they have?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long have they been making the seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: For how long have these strains been
around?
[SPEAKER_01]: After a while, you have a track record.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gain a reputation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not what you say about your
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what everyone else says about your
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of speaks for itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really got to go into depth and do
a lot of research in what you're buying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually, you get what you pay for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're going to do research into
someone and you know they're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: good genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, they're probably going to cost
you more than your usual pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: $150, $200, $300.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you buy a $50 pack of someone that's
knocked off someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, you might be able to find some
really good stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the other hand, yeah, you might get
fucked and it might get a hermy bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's really, you know,
the way that I've always looked at it is
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like I've always tried to buy my
seeds from the source, from the original
[SPEAKER_01]: source, or as close as you can get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so that's why I went to Fancy
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've bought other greenhouse and Mr.
Nice and all these other name breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: I buy from the source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you know what you should be getting
and the reputation behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're just buying some random
cross or it's a crap shoot and you get
[SPEAKER_01]: what you pay for in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So true, so true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've just got a few final fan
submitted questions before we do our final
[SPEAKER_00]: five quick ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: One I'm definitely interested to hear
answer to is do you know any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: origins of the Nigerian silk?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, I was given the Nigerian as a
clone only.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my, from what I remember,
it came from a group of people up in New
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul's New York, who were a bunch of
skydivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, I think the cutting came from
a girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from from what I read the story that I
was told that I guess someone had taken a
[SPEAKER_01]: trip over to Nigeria and brought back
these seeds and they were grown upstate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now how true that is, I don't know,
because I didn't I didn't know the
[SPEAKER_01]: original people, the skydiving people,
I didn't know any of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was my friend who I got the cutting
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can only go by what I was told.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's as far back as I can go
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know that there's been I know,
I know that Neville had released some
[SPEAKER_01]: Nigerian seeds at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there might have been a few other
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, I remember first seeing
the Nigerian from the weasel.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was growing it back in the mid 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember getting it once or twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember him saying how it took too
long and it yielded too little and he cut
[SPEAKER_01]: it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once I remember, you know,
and then once once I was able to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting, yeah, I jumped on on that
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, just like I would with
any elite strain that I got, I tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: make some type of representation and seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, that's really, you know,
what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and that's what I've always been
trying, you know, I've been doing all
[SPEAKER_01]: along and just, you know, I've just been
kind of fortunate on the way things have
[SPEAKER_01]: been working out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's more information than I
knew on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one was, have you ever been given
any breeding advice that was particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: memorable or left an impact on you?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, not not particularly from one
person, because I've kind of learned
[SPEAKER_01]: everything myself going along.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously, you know, I've I've
read, you know, publications from D.J.
[SPEAKER_01]: Schor, Mal Frank, you know, Ed Rosenthal
and, you know, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've tried to do as much research that
I could do as possible, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: other than, you know, really meeting,
you know, Neville or Shanti or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, one of these, you know,
skunk man and having, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of these guys, you know, telling you
something, some type of secret other than
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, because you never get that,
you know, you never get the chance to meet
[SPEAKER_01]: people like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you did, I don't think they
would tell you their breeding secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, a lot of these things,
you kind of kind of just, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: learn as you go along, try to do as much
research as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a lot of books out
there, you know, and now with the Internet
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything, you can kind of get,
you know, a lot more information that that
[SPEAKER_01]: used to be out there that you can get now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely grateful for all the
amount of information that's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question was for you
personally, what are the most rare seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: in your collection?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of a hard question because I
have so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have seeds from all around the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and I guess, you know,
probably, you know, more of the land race
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of stuff, I would say, you know,
because, you know, a lot of this stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you know, I just made,
you know, I made it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so, you know, really,
[SPEAKER_01]: I really can't, I really don't have an,
you know, I'm trying to think,
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't have a specific answer that
I can give you because I would say it's my
[SPEAKER_01]: whole collection in itself, you know,
because I can't point to one particular
[SPEAKER_01]: thing and say, like, that is, you know,
the creme de la creme, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, because everything is,
is so different and special in its own
[SPEAKER_01]: right and deserves its own space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, and there's such a,
and the thing about cannabis is such a
[SPEAKER_01]: wide spectrum of different varieties and
which give you different effects and just
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I mean, I mean, the thing that
would be most valuable is something that I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't get, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if I can get, if I could have
something that I can't get, I would say
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be the most valuable thing,
but, because most things you can get,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially, you know, luckily,
like, you know, someone like me,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if there's something that I
really want, I mean, I can make a post
[SPEAKER_01]: about it and I'm pretty sure, like,
someone out there, you know, would offer
[SPEAKER_01]: me some kind of a trade or something like
that, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't always work like that,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I mean, I guess the thing that,
you know, people want the most right now
[SPEAKER_01]: is that roadkill, that original roadkill
skunk, that Mass Super skunk, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, rancid, you know, skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, you know, I mean, so,
I mean, that's what, that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's looking for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, and that's really why,
you know, I, you know, getting back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: land race stuff and, you know,
so I would have to say probably some of
[SPEAKER_01]: that land race stuff, because you just
don't know what the potential of something
[SPEAKER_01]: could be in there, whereas a lot of this
stuff, I already know what it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so that's, that would probably
be the answer is kind of like the unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, if you have something
that you think has potential, but you just
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know what it is until you actually
get into it, you know, whereas you might
[SPEAKER_01]: have a bunch of sheet stock that you made
and you already kind of know what it is
[SPEAKER_01]: and you already have, you know,
stuff that, you know, clones or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that's, yeah, that's what I
would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strong words.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dig it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So onto our final five quick questions
before we wrap this one up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first one is what is the best or most
memorable single sort of hit or smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: session you've ever had?
[SPEAKER_00]: What left the biggest impression on you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I told that, that, that story
earlier about the tie, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was that, that, that was probably one
of the most memorable smoking sessions
[SPEAKER_01]: that really made an impression on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I, you know, broke out
this, this, this tie weed out of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in the dead, dead show parking
lot, you know, when there's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: eight, 10 people in a circle and,
you know, and we're smoking and people are
[SPEAKER_01]: dropping out like flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that was, you know, that,
that told me that that weed was killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the other end of the spectrum,
was there ever a time when everyone around
[SPEAKER_00]: you was really hyped about this new strain
and everyone's talking it up and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: finally try it and you just really weren't
impressed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess like the Girl Scout cookies and,
you know, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, there's been,
I mean, there's been a lot of strains like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just, you know, being on the
internet for so long and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you, you get caught up in the hype that
people put out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of like how I explained,
you know, the lore of certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I mean, you know, and kind of
like a perfect example would be kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like the Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was something I was,
you know, really, you know, really excited
[SPEAKER_01]: to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I finally got to grow it out
and smoke it, not that it wasn't that bad,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it wasn't that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can kind of see how it had its time
and place in history at one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by the time that I got it,
I already had other strains that fucking,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that crushed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there's a lot of things out
there that, you know, that you hear about
[SPEAKER_01]: and are hyped up and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you finally get into them
and then you're just like, that's just not
[SPEAKER_01]: all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's kind of how I feel
with, you know, a lot of the designer
[SPEAKER_01]: strains that, you know, that are coming
out now and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, the Skittles,
you know, when I finally got to try the
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittles, I mean, it had a nice,
you know, nice taste and all to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, at the end of the day,
I mean, it probably tested out in the low
[SPEAKER_01]: teens in THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you put that into concentrates,
now that becomes a whole different
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, on one hand, I can say,
yeah, I didn't like the flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of sucked, but it, you know,
it had a nice flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you put that into concentrates,
now, you know, now you're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates where you're concentrating
the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really at that point, it's only about
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so now you're taking something
that is not really such a great flour and
[SPEAKER_01]: now making it into a concentrate product
that is exceptional for some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it's, you know, it's,
you just don't know what, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what will become out, what can become out
of a strain, should I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do a desert island situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could only take three strains with
you onto a desert island, what are you
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take the Chem Day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take probably the Black Haze
Pith and probably the OG, a good OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so that, I mean, that's,
you know, so really that would be kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, I got a really good heavy
indigo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a really good Haze Sativa and then
the OG could kind of be like a nice little
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrid, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I think that those three would
be my choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, three really nice picks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could get behind those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now to be a little bit devil's
advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to drop someone else
off on the island and you don't like this
[SPEAKER_00]: person very much, but you get to choose
the three strains you leave them with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to leave them with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if I don't like them very much,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to, you know, I guess you'd have
to give them the blue dream just because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I guess I'd have to give them,
you know, the Girl Scout cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to give them something to,
something just to give you just enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just don't get, it just doesn't get
you quite there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're almost there,
but almost not quite there, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I guess, you know, I just have to
give them a skunk one, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: because what can be more generic than a
skunk one nowadays?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess that those would be of my
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some really good answers there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So final question for the interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could go back to any place and time
in history, where would you go and what
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds would you collect while you were
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: It would definitely have to be back,
you know, in Afghanistan, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely during the Silk Road time,
you know, there was a time, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is really, I believe the
inception of manry seeds because in
[SPEAKER_01]: England they used to run tours,
you know, and they used to run train and
[SPEAKER_01]: bus tours to India and it would go as far
as Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you know anything about the history
of the Silk Road and the routes that it
[SPEAKER_01]: took, you were able to basically,
you know, travel in a lot of these Muslim
[SPEAKER_01]: hash producing countries, you know,
where hash was, you know, originally from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I mean, you used to be able to
just travel freely across Iran,
[SPEAKER_01]: Iraq, Afghanistan,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the Hindu Kush, India,
Nepal, Morocco, all of these countries
[SPEAKER_01]: were very friendly to backpacking hippies
and adventurers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of these countries were legal
back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're talking early 70s,
late 60s, you know, before the drug war,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it was really during that time
that Nixon really forced a lot of those
[SPEAKER_01]: countries to go illegal because we were,
you know, we were funding a lot of those
[SPEAKER_01]: poor countries and we just basically told
them either you make it illegal or we're
[SPEAKER_01]: not giving you any more money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, a lot of those countries
were just forced, you know, to go illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, over, you know,
generations, you know, it just a lot of it
[SPEAKER_01]: has become taboo in some of these
countries like Thailand, for instance,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cannabis is pretty taboo with
the general population over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same could be said in a lot of
Asian countries, you know, most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: modern Asian countries should I say,
you know, you can go to Vietnam and Laos
[SPEAKER_01]: and that in those places and, you know,
the culture still is alive, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, and that really dates back
to, you know, them just using cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp for general use and medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've been using, you know,
this stuff for centuries and had been
[SPEAKER_01]: until, you know, the United States came in
and told them they couldn't do it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, hopefully, you know,
all that stuff will, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: will be coming back in the future as we
get over the stigma of illegal cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's harmful and it's a gateway drug
and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a fantastic sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, thank you so much,
JJ, for coming by and for sharing all your
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge and your experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have any comments or shout outs
you wanted to make before we wrap things
[SPEAKER_00]: up?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I appreciate you having me on and
yeah, I just appreciate everyone's
[SPEAKER_01]: support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if it wasn't for everyone
that's, you know, supported me and helped
[SPEAKER_01]: me over the years, you know, I wouldn't do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be, you know, the person that I
am now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want, you know, to thank
everyone that's, you know, that's ever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, ran a pack of seeds or,
you know, made any type of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: shown any type of support.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, it's nothing that I ever
really imagined it's blossomed into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just really consider myself very
lucky and, you know, and consider,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just to be in a very special,
special spot, you know, and I just want to
[SPEAKER_01]: thank everyone because if it wasn't for
them, it wouldn't be possible.
