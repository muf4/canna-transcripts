[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty, gang, we're back for another
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on this episode, we're joined by one
of the true OGs from the Australian
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis scene, one half of the Wizard of
Oz, and a very highly requested guest
[SPEAKER_04]: indeed.
[SPEAKER_04]: A big welcome to Wally Duck for coming on
the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_04]: No worries, my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Question we normally ask people to start
off is, what have you been smoking on
[SPEAKER_04]: recently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave up about two years ago,
and I share a lot of weed still,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I enjoy seeing people's reactions to
it, but yeah, I don't take it all myself
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 years of bonging, took its toll.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh God, I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's some serious passion there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's interesting you bring that up,
because I think there's some people in the
[SPEAKER_04]: community who would probably really
struggle to sort of identify with how that
[SPEAKER_04]: must feel like.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you said, 40 years to be so involved
and to sort of give it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you find that like really,
is that like the hardest thing you've ever
[SPEAKER_04]: had to do, or is just one of those things
that you sort of got on with and did?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, it was really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: After so long of doing something,
I was a wake and bake guy too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was up at 5.30 every morning having a
few bongs, coughing my head off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you got me curious now.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the rocket fuel for the day?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping it was something sativa if it
was early in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost always, almost always sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my go-to for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there anything specific that was like
the go-to morning smoke, or it just sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of varied with what was on offer in terms
of harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I tell you what I really liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some Lao that I grew for a while
before I stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was by far my favourite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like zero to a hundred in three
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gently took you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it let you down gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no lag afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still got as high, but it was easy on
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And definitely the way to start the
morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, you've caught me out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not familiar with Lao.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just quickly tapped away on Google.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the one from Loud Seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we got it from one of our friends from
the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lives out in Udon Thani in Thailand,
beside Lao.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he rated it as some of the best sativa
he's ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he sent me some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew a fair bit of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept it cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just kept pumping it out for a
while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I have to own up for being a real
goose.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you said Lao with like a D on
the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: You meant Lao.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the Southeast Asian variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was the variety like?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's more like what people might
think of a typical Southeast Asian,
[SPEAKER_04]: like a Thai, Cambodian sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or how would you describe it in flavor and
effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, it reminded me a lot of Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just didn't seem as potent off the bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't just smash you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, it was a bit gentle on
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I enjoyed about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting older.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't need that zero to a hundred and
three second kind of gear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, no one needs to be smoking like A5
or C5 first thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And something I've always been interested
in is I've always heard speculations
[SPEAKER_04]: around the true lineage of Kali Mist.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've heard people even throw like Lao
and Cambodian sort of names in the mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever had any experience with the
infamous Kali Mist and any sort of ideas
[SPEAKER_04]: around what the genetics might be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, we tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew some here and I really liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lineage, no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was familiar to me, that's for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite likely did have some Southeast Asian
in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, before I forget,
out of all the sort of Southeast Asian
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties you've tried, what are some of
the most memorable ones to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it'd have to be Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first weed I ever smoked and
we smoked a fair bit of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was just Thai sticks when I
started and that actually made me sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I smoked bongs,
I was throwing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I went back for more.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's funny you mentioned that because
before you even said it, I was sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: thinking to myself, you know, you hear
these stories of people getting sick off
[SPEAKER_04]: the Thai sticks and some of them have even
gone so far as to throw the idea out there
[SPEAKER_04]: that like maybe they had some sort of
opium on them or, you know, whether it's
[SPEAKER_04]: wives' tale or not, have you ever heard or
thought anything about those rumors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had big debates about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for, you know, inexperienced
people that are not used to that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: weed, it was really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I threw up a fair bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I went back again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real men go back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, before I forget, I just wanted
to ask you, I heard from someone,
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember who it was, so apologies,
whoever told me this, but they said that
[SPEAKER_04]: when you're dealing with people who have
lots of pain, a lot of people think,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, you know, give them an indica,
that's pain killing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then they were like, that's actually
not true.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're probably actually better to give
them like something really sativa because
[SPEAKER_04]: the way it like is stimulating and
creative, it's actually better to be
[SPEAKER_04]: distracted from the pain than to sort of
have something that's like an analgesic
[SPEAKER_04]: for the pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever thought anything along those
lines?
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever thought like maybe sativas
are actually better for pain killing
[SPEAKER_04]: properties than people sort of let on?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or what's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know about pain killing part
of it, but my mum, she had pretty severe
[SPEAKER_00]: lung problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to give her a hash a lot to
make cups of tea with and coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she ended up vaping it too,
but it was mostly sativa because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, she said just the way it makes
you feel the happiness, the euphoria,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what was getting her along.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said there was nothing else to live
for apart from, you know what I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: being a bit happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think indica would have done that
for her.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have helped her with the pain,
but as far as your wellbeing, your sense
[SPEAKER_00]: of happiness, that sort of thing,
I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativa is great for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thanks for sharing that sort of
personal story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to loop back a question, you
mentioned the first thing you smoke was
[SPEAKER_04]: Thai.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other question we normally ask people
first is tell me about your first
[SPEAKER_04]: experience with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Paint me a picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: How did it go down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Joints with my brother-in-law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was about 14 and I was just sitting
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My sister said I wasn't allowed to smoke
any weed till I was 16, but my
[SPEAKER_00]: brother-in-law obviously had other ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he passed me the joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't even do anything to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I smoked two and I was still sober,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said he wasn't going to give me any
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I better get up and go and do
something, you know, to activate myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: get it going, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I stepped into the kitchen, which was a
step down and it hit me then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just, I was in a different
place altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fantastic actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the most delicious lamb roast I'd
ever eaten that night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please for all of our international
listeners, I've been told on good
[SPEAKER_04]: authority, not many people eat lamb
outside of Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eat some lamb.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so bloody good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you can't go wrong, can you?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my favorite meat.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, my partner will kill me because
she swears up and down pork's better,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I'm like, no, lamb for life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so at that time, was there still like
a commercial Thai stick import being
[SPEAKER_04]: brought in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of, it stopped not long after
that, but we had another, up to about,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like 84 or early 85,
we had some stuff they call golden Buddha.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was golden Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember it clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say it was stronger than the Thai
sticks.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's seriously strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, there's been ongoing
discussion for forever, but you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you've grown a lot of these sort of
Southeast Asian varieties yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel like you were ever able to
replicate the flavor and effect you got
[SPEAKER_04]: from the import or like the terroir just
really can't be replicated in that sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: I lived in Melbourne back then,
so we didn't have much chance of trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: replicate, you know, a tropical variety
outdoors and we were growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So up here though, up in Queensland,
North Queensland, there was stuff that was
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar to those Thai sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some a few years after I'd first
tried weed that my mom sent me actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember riding my push bike and I
think it was the fastest I'd ever gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: from A to B, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just imagine that little Wally duck just
fanging it down the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, I mean, up North, in like far
North Queensland, do you feel like the
[SPEAKER_04]: conditions are similar enough that you can
essentially replicate sort of,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, those Thai varieties?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I live is exactly the same latitude
as where they grew a lot of that Thai
[SPEAKER_00]: stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 17 degrees, which is the same as
Udon Thani, which is where a lot of that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff around those provinces came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you can definitely replicate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down the road, there's a climate that's
exactly the same as Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dry, a little bit arid, hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the average temperature is like
about 29 all year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's not like that where I live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a bit too much coastal sort of
influence where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sometimes we have a nice end to
the monsoon season, but other times it
[SPEAKER_00]: just keeps drizzling on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, the wheat doesn't like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, before we go too much into the
Australian medicinal scene, out of
[SPEAKER_04]: curiosity, are there any operations up
there that you're aware of taking
[SPEAKER_04]: advantage of these conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there was a bit of hemp being grown,
but it was pretty haphazard the way they
[SPEAKER_00]: were doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know whether much was,
well, it might have been just trial crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they trialed some hemp up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was just for fibre.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But otherwise, no, I'm not aware of any
weed being grown up here for any legal
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's interesting because I think as
much as it might be sort of left of field
[SPEAKER_04]: and maybe not marketably viable at the
moment, there is a huge demand
[SPEAKER_04]: internationally for these Southeast Asian
varieties grown in that actual sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: latitude as near as close to the actual
origin as you can get.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was thinking maybe that's the
answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, unless Thailand steamrolls ahead
with all their sort of plans and actually
[SPEAKER_04]: starts exporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they probably will.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like a few dollars, those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think you had mentioned to me in
a prior conversation that you were keeping
[SPEAKER_04]: an eye on the Thai scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any predictions or hopes for
how that turns out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see it return to what it was,
but I think it's going to take a bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: searching for them to get that original
stuff back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been over 40 years, so I don't hold
out hope that they can find exactly the
[SPEAKER_00]: same stuff initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have to do a bit of
selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you just made me realise that,
of course, the Thai government doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: have really sick Thai seeds in a seed bank
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just going to go there and assume
that what they've got is probably the real
[SPEAKER_04]: deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me wonder, do you think that
those varieties were lost just over the
[SPEAKER_04]: years and just non-selective breeding,
or do you think it was more like the sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of strain hunters going in and giving out
feminised seeds sort of thing that caused
[SPEAKER_04]: it to be lost?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think it was just time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people on Facebook, Thai people,
they grow all sorts of different weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think they know to keep them
separated a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they probably crossed them and
that, but they're not silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that they've got something
special in that stuff, so I think they do
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's lots of different weed there,
but the bulk of it seems to be the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: available on the street, for instance,
is I think Laos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone seems to agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's compressed brick sort of stuff,
and everyone seems to agree that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: likely from Laos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it's quite good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's interesting because when you
talk to a lot of Australians, I guess the
[SPEAKER_04]: ones I'm talking to aren't necessarily
super plugged into the cannabis scene,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they smoke weed at least every now and
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my friends who have been over there
would sort of say like, oh, you can score
[SPEAKER_04]: it at a pub or whatever, but it's nothing
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm guessing that's not the stuff you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it varies with quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some that was so sticky that when
you poured it into the bowl or wherever,
[SPEAKER_00]: it still moved around by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen stuff do that before?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, wow, like static.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They called it dancing tie, they called
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was pretty potent stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it compared with the tie
stick, but it was still quite good weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, just as a purely hypothetical,
if you had been contracted by the Thai
[SPEAKER_04]: government to go over there and to just
get it all sorted for them, would you be
[SPEAKER_04]: thinking, I need to go around to different
farms and collect some different stock?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or instead, would you be like,
you know what, probably going to have
[SPEAKER_04]: better chance just asking some like old
forum heads for like their Thai seed stock
[SPEAKER_04]: instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably some of the older seed,
but it's probably growing in Laos as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only next door.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed would have absolutely ended up
there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they still grow plenty of weed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you can grow it in your
backyard, like always have been able to in
[SPEAKER_00]: Laos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been no restriction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow a few plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one cares.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, I'd heard some people say that
like some of the parts of like that whole
[SPEAKER_04]: golden triangle in that area, because they
like over the years were so heavily
[SPEAKER_04]: populated by like militia and stuff that
they probably were less polluted,
[SPEAKER_04]: the genetics, so to speak, that were
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you know, they were probably
focusing on like, you know, opium and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'd always got told that they were
still fucking with cannabis around those
[SPEAKER_04]: areas as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know anything about that or not
specifically?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that where I go, I visit Udon Thani
quite a bit whenever I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people I hang out with,
they don't like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of Thais, they really frown upon it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like the farmer types,
you know, that get into a bit of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardworking guy, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: He finishes his day, he goes home,
he relaxes with a few bongs.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so interesting to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I mean, not like it's a
revolutionary statement, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: like a lot of Asian cultures in general
sort of view weed as like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it makes you lazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not good.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I think they'd think it's a bit low
class to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just a low class farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sort of work a guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that makes sense, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the impression I get from the Thais
I hang out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to them about it and they
said, no, you're not coming here and doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not around us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you say that in general,
they're sort of more into stimulants or
[SPEAKER_04]: just like alcohol or like nothing?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess it must be an interesting
experience for you to go over there now
[SPEAKER_04]: when you're not smoking or consuming
compared to back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you're probably seeing and doing
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go there for the food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've eaten Thai food.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can only imagine how good the food
you've had is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lifestyle it's, it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even without weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's get back on track.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we had a nice little, little detour
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me a little bit about your first
grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember the strain you were
growing or do you remember like what sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of technology you were using?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it outdoor?
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was outdoor and it was just bag
seed that my older brother-in-law
[SPEAKER_00]: collected and it was late harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess it was probably more sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bit of purple stuff amongst it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bit of hermaphrodite and really tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew it huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been Ash Wednesday fires
around Melbourne there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So must have been 1984, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was long time harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took forever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't really the correct stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not like we could pick and choose
back then like we can now, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the OG trim.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jail took forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember it back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mustn't trim much of it to like we do
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We must have been a bit lazy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I don't remember lots and lots of
trimming then.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like maybe I'm, maybe I was meant
for back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I feel like as time goes by,
I trim less.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm just like, eh, I'm smoking it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do it at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, so what was the progression then
from like, you know, sort of first grow to
[SPEAKER_04]: like being really in the thick of it and
being like, yeah, like I really like doing
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did hobby growing cause I liked
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't until probably the late
nineties, early two thousands that I got
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly serious about it and started to
grow a fair bit of weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And were you still down in Victoria or had
you moved up north by then?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was up north by then.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was, I was worried about the laws
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The laws have always been so strict,
you know, but I threw course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me a bit about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I'm sure there's a lot of people who
aren't aware.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what was the legal climate like say
in the mid to late nineties for a cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it had improved at that point,
but earlier on, I guess probably in the
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties when Joe Bajolki Peterson was the
the premier, they were, they were giving
[SPEAKER_00]: you life in jail for a production of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know why they did that,
but so you didn't want to get caught even
[SPEAKER_00]: with just a few ounces of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd go to jail for a fair while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it did change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think at some point, I know I got
caught so a number of times in fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think eventually it actually lessened
than, you know, it was less than down
[SPEAKER_00]: south and I don't know why, but the party
and political party of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: the laws changed, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not so bad these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been caught a fair bit of weed and
I'm still here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can make it through, we all going
to make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at the time, let's say like,
let's, let's start at like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the late eighties, early nineties when it
was like, you know, quite illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm guessing you weren't looking online
for friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were like, I'm just keeping to myself
and staying out of jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or what was it like?
[SPEAKER_00]: I never even came online until it must've
been early 2000, 2001, 2000, 2001,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found this actually a lady in Africa
and she was selling weed online,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I never thought it had happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I didn't think we can buy it,
you know, but she said, look, it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not give it a go?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, yeah, all right, I'll give it a
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, and it arrived.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I did a little bit of business with
her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I traded seeds with her and she sent me
hash and weed and, and it all got here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, it was good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I mean, you know, outside of Durbin,
you don't really hear about a lot of South
[SPEAKER_04]: African weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think she was in Cape town maybe,
but, um, and she had a variety of weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way it was a bit average, but the
stuff I grew from it was pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew some decent, some Swazi,
uh, it was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such a, a really nice high on it,
uh, euphoric.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, that feel good stuff,
which is actually my go-to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pure Swazi back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a treat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm jealous.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so before, let's, let's wind back to
just before you got online, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's say it's year 2000.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you know anyone else who was growing
or you were really sort of like on your
[SPEAKER_04]: own, doing your own thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was just locals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's, there's always been a growing
scene up here where I live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's been pretty popular for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so locals just sharing knowledge and
sharing seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it was just bag seed too,
mostly whatever we could get, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a bit of a hit and miss thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, out of curiosity, was there
ever a sort of a definitive point where
[SPEAKER_04]: you feel like Indica's were introduced?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know, you hear the Californian
guys talk about like, they were like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it was all Mexican and Sativa
and then the hippies brought the Afghanis
[SPEAKER_04]: in, in like the late seventies or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you ever remember that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Happening for far North Queensland?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I would have been down South,
but when I was a young fella, I,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I would have been, I don't know about
15 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, um, we, we grew that Sativa,
like I said, and I hadn't seen any short
[SPEAKER_00]: fast flowering sorts of stuff at that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, there was a news report from,
uh, Mildura where they found a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of, uh, weed and the plants were three or
four foot tall and just one huge bud,
[SPEAKER_00]: no branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'd say that was Indica at a guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess you probably hadn't really
seen anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was really surprised actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we grew like after that,
you know, bits and pieces and there was
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely hybrids amongst it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it wasn't all Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started growing indoors and we were
successful and some, there was taller
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was shorter stuff, you know,
there was a variety of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm certain that quite a bit of what
would have been hybrid stuff, hybrids of
[SPEAKER_00]: those Indicas and the Sativas we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, but there, I don't remember any
specific point where that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was probably too young.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like you were sort of at that
generation that bridged, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like the old and the new world sort of
stuff, which is really cool to get your
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, out of curiosity, were you aware of
any of the international seed banks?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm sure like, the seed bank and
Sensi seeds and stuff in the mid nineties
[SPEAKER_04]: were doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you know about them or you were like,
just like, no, we just work with what we
[SPEAKER_04]: got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got scum when I guess it was,
would have been in the nineties,
[SPEAKER_00]: early nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, people started growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'd been a real drought between the,
uh, imported stuff and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, Australia having to look after their
own cells with weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, the price of weed went to like
$750 an ounce at one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like probably for about a
year before, you know, everyone got
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, I guess, and decided, shoot,
we got to get our gear together here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, and yeah, that not long after
that, that's when we saw our first skunks
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, and Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought a fair bit of it because,
uh, I've had some Colombian prior to that,
[SPEAKER_00]: some Colombian gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest, the, the look of the
skunk reminded me of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high didn't, but the look of it,
it was golden looking, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was pretty nice looking stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it that, you know, cause there's
obviously that never ending debate about
[SPEAKER_04]: roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess I'm wondering, do you remember
there being like a particularly acrid
[SPEAKER_04]: skunkiness to it or was it more the sweet
stuff that you hear about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've never smelled a skunk,
but, um, that first stuff we got it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it permeated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it really, you couldn't keep it in
your pocket in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't take it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was strong smelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I don't know whether it came from
seeds from Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually certain the first stuff we
tried called, uh, it was called Cal skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that didn't come from any seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure they had friends in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a little bit different to be
honest, but, um, yeah, the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I don't, I don't know
about roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to smell it to know that,
you know, so.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I, when I was in the States a few
years ago, I, uh, I managed to drive past
[SPEAKER_04]: the dead one and pull over and smell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's largely, it's largely like just a
really acrid rotten garlic smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, like ammonia and garlic,
like makes your nostrils flare and that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like sometimes how you'd smoke a
strain, you'd exhale and it really coats
[SPEAKER_04]: your mouth and your nostrils flare.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get like a bit, almost like you
got like something sour in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like that's sort of what the skunk
thing does, but that's interesting to
[SPEAKER_04]: hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it sounds like you had some
pretty OG stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, especially if you could really see
that Colombian in it, which is,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is neat, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, what were your thoughts on the NL?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we've had such a resurgence of
NL over the past 15, 20 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you look back fondly on it or do you
just think, oh, you know, it's just
[SPEAKER_04]: another one of the strains at the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I didn't rate it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked the skunk to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think the Northern whites was as
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought a fair bit of it, but,
um, no, I didn't, uh, I preferred the
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk to be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was novel for us just to have those
sorts of things after what we had had,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So continuing on, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You've, you've just come online.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the first thing that happened
online?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it discovering one of the big forums
and you're like, oh, wow, like there's
[SPEAKER_04]: this whole community or, or was it more
like you discovered some local people via
[SPEAKER_04]: some other means?
[SPEAKER_04]: How did it all go down online?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I met a guy on, um, I think there
was a forum called Sweet Leaf or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I met that, um, African lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and I had, I had duckswood seeds
and I wanted to know more about,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, where they come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'd never seen cannabis like that
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that's the reason I went on the
forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, then when a few of them saw it,
they said they'd never seen it either,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, one thing led to another and,
um, I was on Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me pull you back before we jump into
Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause everyone's so fond about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We, we had a lot of viewers ask about your
ducksfoot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess, you know, you could boil it
down to one or two sort of questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's asking in different forms,
but it was sort of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: first off, how'd you get access to the
ducksfoot originally?
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend showed it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He described it a couple of times to me,
not very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he just said it was a strain with
three finger leaves on it, which I,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really didn't pique my attention
very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when I saw it, I thought,
whoa, it doesn't, it didn't even look like
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, particularly the first stuff we
grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it took him a fair bit to get it
off the guy that had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I think the guy ran into trouble,
had to give away a box of seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we ended up with some.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, from that we only had a few
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we grew, we only ended up with
one ducksfoot plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I think though, the other ones,
the non-ducksfoot ones, they'd already had
[SPEAKER_00]: some, they'd been crossed with that
already, I'm pretty sure, because we just
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed one of the miles with the
ducksfoot and we ended up with more
[SPEAKER_00]: ducksfoot and normal leafed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, that's where it stemmed from
initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I just thought it was so novel
that, uh, and I didn't want to lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just saw it as, you know, silly Aussie
backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, we're going to probably lose it if
we're not careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm best to try and spread it around so
that that doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: A man for the people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess sort of, uh, as a follow-up to
that, what percentage of those offspring
[SPEAKER_04]: were coming out with the ducksfoot
phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's probably about 50% close enough
to, it took a few generations to get it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, completely all ducksfoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I neglected the other traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was no, you know, I didn't know much
about breeding cannabis at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still regard myself as just a hobby
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just do it for a bit of fun and to make
ourselves some seeds, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's no, no interest in selling
seeds, to be honest, um, just to share a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of cannabis, make, make ourselves some
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so it took a few generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time I made something that ended up
on the market, I was a bit embarrassed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be honest, how that I'd lost some of the
important parts of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, by that, do you mean like the,
like the flavor or the effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the flavor, the buds look better to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people did say they got some stuff
that was more similar to what we had
[SPEAKER_00]: started with, but we saved a bunch of the
seed or I got my friend to, and I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: that was safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd asked him, you know, make sure you
keep that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, he had a status.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's freezer and, um, he ended up
giving it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I thought, Oh, look, I've probably
messed this up a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go back and get the originals and
we'll try again.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pretty disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave them to his ex-wife's boyfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who does that?
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy banging your wife, your ex-wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a turn of events.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would have thought?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, um, interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in terms of the original, um,
what, what sort of flavor and effect did
[SPEAKER_04]: it have?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was varied a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of coffee, sometimes a little
bit hashy, really strong aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like super strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I would have rated it up there with,
um, skunk permeation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really, really, you can smell a
plant from a long, long way away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, I got some other web stuff from,
uh, from Hawaii, uh, Hawaiian webbed
[SPEAKER_00]: indica as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a trade with a Hawaiian guy
because, um, it seemed like his stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, was lacking the traits that mine had
and a bit vice versa, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought we'd trade and, and see what
we come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, he didn't say his stuff was
indica, but it was, uh, it grew completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different to mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was no branching, small, fat stemmed,
uh, pungent little plant and, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I made a cross with that in
duck's foot and that smelled even
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that stuff was, uh, you couldn't
hide it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard, I heard of people getting
busted with little tiny buds in their car
[SPEAKER_00]: because it just stunk.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that sounds really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, you sort of, like,
I mean, you gave me the perfect segue into
[SPEAKER_04]: the next question, which was that one of
our listeners had asked, do you know
[SPEAKER_04]: anything about whether the duck's foot
originally comes from Hawaii?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because a lot of people have sort of said
that over the years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that it comes from one spot
or maybe different places simultaneously?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just a common mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just a common mutation and
they're not necessarily related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't sure for a while, but I asked Sam
about it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, he found some 20 years before
I was doing, uh, when he started initially
[SPEAKER_00]: reversing cannabis, they found some web
leaf stuff that, uh, he said he didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really see a use for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they never kept it, but, um,
I think it's just a trade in cannabis to
[SPEAKER_00]: see if it can appear sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, I think that sometimes the
duck's foot can get grouped into this
[SPEAKER_04]: category as, cause I'm not sure if you've
been following closely, but there's sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of two other well-known plants now that
have like, you know, sort of these very
[SPEAKER_04]: altered phenotypical appearances being the
Australian bastard cannabis, which you're
[SPEAKER_04]: probably very familiar with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, as well as the super freak,
which is a more sort of new creation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's got like a very hyper serrated
leaf, which makes it look essentially like
[SPEAKER_04]: a fern.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I guess I'm sort of interested
because those two strains I just
[SPEAKER_04]: mentioned, ABC and super freak,
they're not regarded as necessarily the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the be alls in terms of smoke quality and
effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more of like a tool to help like try
to hide the crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I've heard from you sounds like
the duck's foot really did sort of stand
[SPEAKER_04]: on its own in terms of the effect and the
flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that sort of your impression?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly that hybrid we made,
that was amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smell was so strong that pruning it
would make you nauseous after a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't really trim a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made you feel sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like fumes coming off the stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd still write it as some of the
strongest weed I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really, really potent stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did that one ever make it out into the
masses at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I guess I've lost it through getting
busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did try and back some up,
but that was lost as well too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some things are just not meant to be,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Australian bastard cannabis recently and,
and that freak stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I dunno, I didn't smoke any of
the bastard stuff, but my friends smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: the freak and they said it was quite good,
but, uh, it was just a little bit of low
[SPEAKER_00]: yielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, amazing looking plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Hey, I'd be curious to know,
did you ever smoke it back in the day?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause people always used to say that back
in the day, it was like, it gave,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was like the worst high gave you like a
headache.
[SPEAKER_04]: And did you ever experience that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The bastard cannabis, you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I never smoked any of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to think it was hemp and,
uh, by what people report, it sounds like
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember just reading the word Bindi or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they would call it Bindi.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like, I guess it was like the
old equivalent of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the Beasters, like, you know, like the
shitty regweed or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I'm, I'm glad you haven't,
uh, you know, had to smoke that in the
[SPEAKER_04]: words of skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've only got so many breaths in this life
to fill my lungs with, and I'm not going
[SPEAKER_04]: to waste it on some shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're sort of jumping back to the time
line.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the first strain you ever bred?
[SPEAKER_04]: And was it intentional or was it an
accident?
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to make seeds for ourselves out of
the bag seed we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of it was any good, we,
cause we needed more seed every year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just like filial breed at most
times, like just pop the bag seed and
[SPEAKER_04]: breed the brothers to the sisters,
or you sort of out crossing it to
[SPEAKER_04]: different stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: With whatever we had at the time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, just a bit of pardon the pun,
but just potluck what we came up with.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I was talking to a friend the other
day and cause he had just recently started
[SPEAKER_04]: taking clones of like everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, this is the way to do it,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's, it's annoying and it takes
space, but trust me, it's good to have the
[SPEAKER_04]: clone of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was sort of saying to him,
you know, think of all these legendary
[SPEAKER_04]: clones throughout history, you know,
whatever, you know, chem dog, OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever you want to think of.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, and I'd always say, think about
how many chem dogs have existed throughout
history.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're just never cloned or we're just,
you know, haphazardly made through sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of, you know, breeding one thing to
another.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, I guess what I'm sort of getting
is are there any plants you remember from
[SPEAKER_04]: your, like, you know, from the history
where you're like, man, I remember this
[SPEAKER_04]: one plant we grew.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so special.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, you know, we didn't keep a
clone, but like, if, if I had it,
[SPEAKER_04]: it would stand up to modern elites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Oh yeah, there was a few of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some pretty cool African stuff from
that seed that girl sent me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them were, one was that it
smelled so disgusting that I actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: I killed it and I couldn't even give it
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was that disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smelled like a stink bug, you know,
stink bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't even give it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought I'd, uh, I just chucked it in
a box and threw it on top of the cupboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought one day when we're out of
weed, we might want to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, months down the track,
we got it out and it was actually quite
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smell of dissipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave some to the guy that I'd
offered it to him for nothing and he
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he came back later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyway, he said it was some of the
best weed he'd had.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said to me, and, uh, he, uh,
I said, so you could have had the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: lot for nothing, but you wouldn't take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm going to keep it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's, that's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember, cause a lot of people might
hear that and think, how could you like
[SPEAKER_04]: consider giving it away?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still weed or whatever, but it's
like, I remember one time I was at Bodie's
[SPEAKER_04]: house and he's like, Oh, smell this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called arse.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, really?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, yeah, it's like American
skunk selection, but like smell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it proper smelled like an asshole.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had some in this bong and I'm going
to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, I'm like hesitantly bringing
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, am I about to like vomit?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, cause if this tastes like it smells,
I'm going to vomit and thank fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't translate the smell at all,
but I can only imagine what you went
[SPEAKER_04]: through.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have been fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not licking your lips type of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, um, I guess sort of at the point
when the duck's foot that you said,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you felt like you'd lost some
traits, but it was sort of going out to
[SPEAKER_04]: market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of people still really
viewed that as like a really worthwhile
[SPEAKER_04]: tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: People still looking for that seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have any idea at the time that it
was going to go on to become this sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: legendary stock that like people are
hunting for like, you know, wild right
[SPEAKER_04]: now?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a few people still sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it on some Facebook pages and that
sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely still out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's what, that's what I think
is really interesting is like,
[SPEAKER_04]: people are really looking for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's sort of funny cause it'll,
it'll tie into when we talk about some of
[SPEAKER_04]: your strains later on with like the MBS
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I feel like there's a similarity
between your ducks foot and a lot of Tom
[SPEAKER_04]: Hills lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's these old lines that
people are really hunting for now cause
[SPEAKER_04]: they're like, they recognize the value.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of these older lines have just
inherently within them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess you're sort of saying at the
time you weren't really aware it was going
[SPEAKER_04]: to have this ripple effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It did.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, like I was just trying to save the
stuff because I just thought there was
[SPEAKER_00]: some importance with that leaf and it
might be useful to people, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to hide their plants and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I'm sure it probably helped a few,
a few people probably grew stuff where
[SPEAKER_00]: they weren't able to before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for that stench.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The camouflage aspect's undeniable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take me a little bit forward now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, maybe it was happening at the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you first meet Moon Unit and what
sort of got you first thinking about the
[SPEAKER_04]: idea of, you know, the wizards of Oz?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just on the forums on ICMAG and he
posted some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoidfuel, I'm pretty sure it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: His Zoidfuel, you've heard of Zoidfuel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've contacted him and with him being
an Aussie, you know, I wanted to know more
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got some seed out off of him and
I grew some, it was amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe that just an average
Aussie guy could make something so good
[SPEAKER_00]: out of a few land roses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an excellent effort.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not many of the people that breed cannabis
actually do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: They always start with someone else's
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas he made it himself.
So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with non-European or American
genetics, it was just like Ozzie Bushweed,
[SPEAKER_00]: P&G Gold and some of that Chinese indica
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Incredible stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I guess you guys just sort of hit
it off from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, well, we decided we'd try and make
a few things that people might like and he
[SPEAKER_00]: did it all and it wasn't me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just sent him some seeds and spoke with
him on the phone and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was more his work than mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I feel like, you know, you
contributed pretty well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how did you feel about it all?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when you're releasing the seeds,
were you sort of thinking like,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's going pretty well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we should keep doing this or like,
yeah, what was your thoughts at the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we were pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a few dramas though.
[SPEAKER_00]: The MBS that had Hermes in it and we
weren't able to shake them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was lovely stuff though.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave it to some medicinal patients back
then because even though medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis wasn't a big thing then,
it was starting to take off and it gave
[SPEAKER_00]: you the munchies severely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy, he was dying of AIDS
apparently and he'd lost the will to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't eating anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he was down to like 90 pounds or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the guys that we gave the stuff
to, he gave him some MBS and he reported
[SPEAKER_00]: he put on like 30 pounds in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like eight, 10 years later,
he was still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: He reckons it saved his life that week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I believe you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, you know, without,
excuse me, you know, without trying to get
[SPEAKER_04]: too sentimental, like, gosh, that must
make you feel like it's all sort of worth
[SPEAKER_04]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I said medicine was new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought that was a bit fancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a bit fancy for medicinal weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a way for us stoners to,
you know, to legitimize what we were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I get what you mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you sort of just touched on is a
concept that I actually first heard from
[SPEAKER_04]: our buddy Todd.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he, I don't know if he coined the
term, but I sort of looked into it
[SPEAKER_04]: afterwards and he said this term,
hippie guilt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like what you just touched on,
like this guilt we feel around the fact
[SPEAKER_04]: that like, we just like this plant and we,
you know, as you said, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like we give it the name medicinal to sort
of try to legitimize what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, the reason why we do that
is because we inherently feel a bit guilty
[SPEAKER_04]: because we're made to feel that what we're
doing is bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if we can say it's medicinal,
well, now it's actually good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you ever feel like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you ever feel like, because I
certainly feel that way at times,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, as in like, on the one hand,
I know that clearly what I'm doing is
[SPEAKER_04]: fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: The laws are wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't determine what's right or wrong
ethically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that growing a plant is not
inherently wrong, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_04]: you do feel a bit bad because there's like
this stigma in society and culturally,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not as accepted as we might like.
[SPEAKER_04]: How have you wrestled that sort of dynamic
of, you know, being essentially a real
[SPEAKER_04]: famous guy in a scene that you can't tell
any of your friends about for the most
[SPEAKER_04]: part?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, I felt the same thing,
but I tell you what, I read something
[SPEAKER_00]: recently or heard someone say that all
cannabis uses medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I thought about that,
I thought, well, yeah, it is, even if we
[SPEAKER_00]: just, you know, lifting your spirits,
do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like I said, my mother was doing,
you know, that that's medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're all using it for a medicinal
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, when I stopped smoking,
the, the realization that I had been using
[SPEAKER_00]: it medicinally for a whole bunch of things
that I didn't even know I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All cannabis uses medicinal in my opinion
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I tend to agree, you know,
like, um, I think it's somewhat vogue for
[SPEAKER_04]: people to have reasons for why they're
using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like yourself at a certain point,
I just tried to move away from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, I'm not going to say I'm
using it for X condition or Y condition.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to say I'm using it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just improving my quality of life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all that needs to be said
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent, a hundred percent.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to jump back onto the topic,
you know, you're talking about some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: work you did with Moon Unit and the MBS
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: How, how did those strains get received
domestically?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you feel like you were getting any
traction within the Aussie community at
[SPEAKER_04]: all, or it was mostly going to overseas
people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there was never really an official
release of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We generally just shared them,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, and I do recall some American
people came down to the Mardi Gras and
[SPEAKER_00]: someone shared it with them there and they
reported it to be pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was well received.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we smoked a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always a good testament.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, was there like a somewhat
active Australian scene or did you really
[SPEAKER_04]: feel like it was just the two of you out
on an island doing your own thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like no one else was really on the same
level, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we even, I went to a Sydney cannabis
cup at one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, I think it was two years in a
row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I went to one of them, this
redheaded guy, he was crazy guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I, when I went to first visit him
was, uh, on our, on our way to the Mardi
[SPEAKER_00]: Gras.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so the, the guy was to,
to visit him and we're all going to hook
[SPEAKER_00]: up and then we go to the Mardi Gras.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wanted to enter a whole bunch of
these stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew in this factory and, um,
I've not long been busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was a little bit cautious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that I was heading there to
go and spend two nights in a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, he didn't end up going,
we went to the, me and his friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Rodwell went to the, uh, the Mardi
Gras.
[SPEAKER_00]: On our own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, we entered his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I entered some hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there wasn't a, uh, uh, uh,
section for hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I'm not sure they, they said it
spoiled it for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the people, because they smoked
the hash and then the rest of the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't do anything for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't care if we won or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't the, you know, it was just
about entering, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that's what that Mardi Gras is
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not to be taken seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we won, you know, that that's not what
it's about.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually, it was a really great
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, we had a great time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, did you, did you bump into any
other growers while you're in Nimbin,
[SPEAKER_04]: for example?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sure I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it's a bit of a blur though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess sort of the picture I'm getting
is that like, it wasn't like you bumped
[SPEAKER_04]: in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Into another Wally duck equivalent where
you're like, Oh, Hey, you, you're like
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of doing your own thing in the way
that we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't meet on the second time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I told, um, a couple of American guys
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them met me there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, uh, he ended up being the,
um, uh, one of the IC, uh, tech guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, did the forums and,
um, they thought it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had been coming and staying in
Australia for at least six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there was a bit of an eye opener
for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought we had a great kind of
lifestyle, a good outlook on life and that
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely any of our, uh, American
listeners who are wondering if life in
[SPEAKER_04]: Australia would be good.
[SPEAKER_04]: The answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've invited heaps of people and they've
all really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, some of them, uh, particularly a
Finnish guy said, it spoiled them forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to come back and they're not
satisfied living in Finland anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I can't comment on Finland,
but I can definitely say as much as I
[SPEAKER_04]: enjoy spending time in the States,
um, I'm always very happy when I touch
[SPEAKER_04]: back down on Australian soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like when I see the Australian
native plants, I'm like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: all right, I'm home.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so moving the story along,
you know, was there a definitive moment
[SPEAKER_04]: where sort of you and moon unit,
sort of split ways or was it just sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: like a slow fizzle and you both just sort
of went your different pathways in life?
[SPEAKER_04]: How did that progress?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we kept in touch, but he got busted
and, um, I haven't spoken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I might've spoken to him after
that, but I can't, I don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a phone number for him
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep meaning to try it, to see what he's
doing, whether it works or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, he's, he's in New South Wales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gather that, um, being busted there
wasn't very good for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, don't know whether he went to jail or,
or what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, and, uh, so yeah, that was
basically the end of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to get in touch with him again.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, not that I've looked particularly
hard, but I, I guess it's probably safe to
[SPEAKER_04]: assume he dropped off after that for just
obvious legal reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him, him and, and Kanga Teva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think sometimes, um, you lose
interest after you get in that much
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, you figure you, you better put
your energy in another direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's possibly what both
those guys have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still speak to Kanga a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I think he's lost interest in
weed after being in jail for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really tainted it for him.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can, I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, while we're on the topic of Kanga,
like I'm guessing you were around when he
[SPEAKER_04]: was pretty active and during the time when
he was busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to do a collaboration
together, but, um, yeah, that quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: ended.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, um, did you have any thoughts?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you know, there's a lot of rumors
around the Kanga bust and people link it
[SPEAKER_04]: to Gypsy Nirvana and various other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have any thoughts on how that went
down or you just think it was probably
[SPEAKER_04]: just, you know, like a loose lip sort of
thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I think someone found their plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how, but, uh, that's what I
seem to recall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think he thinks anyone died being
in either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was just luck of the draw and
bad luck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, while we're on the topic of Kanga,
you know, the strain that always gets
[SPEAKER_04]: referenced is the, the Malin Bibi madness.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like it's one of those strains
where it's just got, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so much mythology attributed to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just so hard to find verifiable
information about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your thoughts on Malin Bibi
madness?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you ever try it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it is as good as people
sometimes make it out to be?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do you stand?
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard about that stuff when I was like
15 and a guy was a brother-in-law's friend
[SPEAKER_00]: was heading up North from where we were.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were in Melbourne to get some,
I gave him a hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, get me some.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a hundred dollars for me when I was 15
was a fair bit of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must've been pretty good weed,
but, uh, everyone seems to think that
[SPEAKER_00]: everything from Malin Bibi ended up being
called or NIMB in the area ended being
[SPEAKER_00]: called that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, would the plate with the real,
uh, Malin Bibi madness, please stand up
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had heard that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the story made sense, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like as soon as the name came out,
every dealer in Mullum's calling their
[SPEAKER_04]: weed, Malin Bibi madness.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, um, from what you saw of what
Kanga was doing, you must've sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: thought, Oh, well, I guess given how much
he's messing with it, like it must be
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sent some to Neville and Neville
said to him that it was as good as the
[SPEAKER_00]: haze he had had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gather it was pretty good gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't, I didn't smoke any of Kanga's
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kanga's pot, but, um, it seemed to have a
pretty good reputation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I'm sure it was just, you know,
killer outdoor sativa, like largely like
[SPEAKER_04]: what you were probably growing for the
most part was probably, and that's the
[SPEAKER_04]: other thing I try to remind myself is
like, you hear all these stories,
[SPEAKER_04]: but back in the day, like good weed was
hard to find.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people probably remember things like,
you know, really well as like,
[SPEAKER_04]: yo, that was the best weed I had in
forever, like sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd agree with, uh, um, that nostalgia
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say that a lot of, a lot of the
weed we were getting was shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then suddenly we'd have something good
and it would waste us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because our tolerance was down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hadn't had anything good for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I think there's a lot of truth to
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, while we're on the topic of
Mullen Madness, I've always wondered
[SPEAKER_04]: myself, and maybe you can chime in to some
degree, maybe not, or good if you can't,
[SPEAKER_04]: do you think Mullen Bibi Madness is
different to Old Mother Sativa?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I feel like as much as people maybe
try to talk about them as different,
[SPEAKER_04]: different, they, they maybe are just the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know to comment on that really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen both of them and they're
obviously both satiricals, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, relationship, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There, there seems to be, uh, rumors that
Mullen Bibi was tied across with
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbian.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I'd heard that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Interesting.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, I, I definitely heard that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought, cause that's also one of
the rumored genetic combinations of,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, Callie Mist.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I was like, well, that would make
sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that was meant to be a really good
sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like it would make sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: A similar genetic combination could make a
good, good sativa, but, uh, interesting,
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I, I don't know if you know the
answer to this, but when we were talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about the Zoid fuel and, um, the Aussie
bushweed, was that like old mother sativa
[SPEAKER_04]: or like a different Aussie bushweed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was just sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I know, there was a fair bit of
that around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mullen seemed to think that it was,
uh, a bit, it was, must've been strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he said it was a bit paranoid in
inducing, you know, a bit scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, that's, that's what he liked
about, uh, the Chinese Indica that he
[SPEAKER_00]: added to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he said that was like anti-anxiety
sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it leveled, it leveled the high
out a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tend to agree that, uh, Zoid fuel
was real, uh, you know, feel good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, it gave you that nice,
uh, buzzing in the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I would write it similar to,
um, MDMA actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was similar to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was a really psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I don't know, just a buzz in the
head and a euphoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, I'd say it was quite similar
to that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a testament to the power of the old
world strains, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people say, and unless you,
at least you were smoking with stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: was scary and paranoid, it wasn't that
strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I, I disagree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can still be fun, you know,
and happy and uplifting and be very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very strong, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and in terms of like the Z99 cross you
guys made with, um, your C99, can you tell
[SPEAKER_04]: us a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you just send the seeds over to Moon
Unit?
[SPEAKER_04]: Had that one go down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I sent, uh, some, I was F5,
C99, I think something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and then he just, uh,
he sent me back samples of different
[SPEAKER_00]: females that he'd used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, we must have had a similar taste
in weed because we both selected the same
[SPEAKER_00]: one without talking to one another.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it actually, uh, it was similar to the
Zoid fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must have taken traits from that
because it had that nice little buzzing
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of in your head type of high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, we, we still grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've still got Z99.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we still grow that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You read my mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause the next question was a question
from one of the listeners who said,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, please pass on my thanks to Wally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Huge fan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of his work.
[SPEAKER_04]: He sent me some Z99 to test out years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got to be honest, I did a pretty
pitiful job of doing it outdoors at the
[SPEAKER_04]: time, but I'm really curious to know if he
has any more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I can do a better job this time
round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, I have a bunch of Z99 seeds and,
um, I still make seeds because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: still a, people are still growing cannabis
out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we got to, we got to use this
opportunity now, if anyone was interested
[SPEAKER_04]: in getting some of your seeds,
what's, what's the best avenue for them to
[SPEAKER_04]: make contact?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I haven't really sold any on that
guy that has trouble receiving funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was my, always my problem,
you know, I don't know how, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and I did, was going to do a
collaboration with another Aussie guy
[SPEAKER_00]: recently, uh, Mr. Dots and, um,
he had the same trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was he going to receive the funds
without disclosing his address or,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, interesting stuff, interesting
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'll put you in touch with,
uh, some friends of mine who, who run a
[SPEAKER_04]: seed bank in Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: They might be able to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: This chat just became worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, in terms of your seeds,
would you largely say that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: knowingly or unknowingly they're sort of
bred for Aussie conditions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I know that like, you know,
being Queensland native, myself,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of strains really struggle with the
heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, do you think these might be good
candidates for people in those
[SPEAKER_04]: environments where like heat is a factor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're, we're definitely testing that out
by just growing them here ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's largely why we make them for our
local friends to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because you know, there's never enough
good weed around us there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and we've got a great climate and when
I didn't have any weed, I'd, I'd want,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd want to go and find some.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was always just shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I thought, well, if I could make
enough seed to share with the locals,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, then when I run out of weed,
there's going to be something decent to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, around with any luck anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that's what I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, I get a lot of people visiting
me these days for that very thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, we, you know, I do benefit from
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned that because I always said
that was, uh, that was my initial
[SPEAKER_04]: motivation for making seeds as well was I
just thought if there ever came a time
[SPEAKER_04]: where I wasn't able to grow for myself,
I just want to be able to know that I
[SPEAKER_04]: could buy some decent quality off someone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I think, I think it does sort of
help you get there, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a foot in the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had shared some seeds with someone
and they've grown some good stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: the chances of you being able to acquire
some often is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a business proposition.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And out of curiosity, uh, you know,
cause I, I think that Instagram and the
[SPEAKER_04]: internet in general has done a lot for the
cannabis community, undoubtedly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it feels like in Australia,
there's a newly emerging sort of scene
[SPEAKER_04]: that's a bit more, how shall you say
online, not just in like the internet
[SPEAKER_04]: sense, but as in like we're coming online,
we're all linking up, like we're all nodes
[SPEAKER_04]: in a network and we're linking with each
other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like there is slowly beginning
to emerge a clone sharing scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think it's really there just
yet, but I think in the next few years,
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll really see it come to fruition
where, you know, cause often people come
[SPEAKER_04]: on the show and they say, Oh, you know
what, like what's, you know, UK has
[SPEAKER_04]: cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: What does Australia have?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, Oh, there isn't really a one
thing that Australia has that gets passed
[SPEAKER_04]: around per se.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I feel like in time that might happen
as clones get traded.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you noticed the development of like a
sort of cannabis scene or a clone sharing
[SPEAKER_04]: scene per se?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I hope that's beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to say we're probably like the
last cab off the rank using the internet
[SPEAKER_00]: for these sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of Aussies are very paranoid people
and they're shy away from technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know, I've got friends that don't
even have phones and half of them don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know how to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've never, dared to go on a
cannabis site.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a bit funny given,
you know, people like you and I,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, we're out there on there and
nothing much happens to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, it increases our knowledge
and our network basing and friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been beneficial and these guys are
missing out on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hugely, hugely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've, the amount of messages I've had over
the years from people who are like,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know, I want to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't want to get busted.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was sort of thinking if they were
going to be busting someone, like they'd
[SPEAKER_04]: probably go for like a big fish.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your secrets to not being busted?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just like, Oh, just like,
don't sell hard drugs or like associate
[SPEAKER_04]: with people who do hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's sort of my only rule.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, if you do or sell hard drugs,
I probably won't really want to hang out
[SPEAKER_04]: with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's always kept me really safe,
you know, because I pretty much just hang
[SPEAKER_04]: around with other growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good rule.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: While we're on the topic, what's your
thoughts on the Australian legal climate?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, obviously in the past few years,
we've seen the ACT legalise two plants per
[SPEAKER_04]: person, per household, with an upper limit
of six plants per household.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, three people pulling their
plants together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel like that's a step in the
right direction or are you sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: thinking like, Oh, it's, you know,
it's a bandaid for a bullet wound.
[SPEAKER_04]: What can you do with two plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it might be a start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're not allowed to possess
seeds, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds are still illegal for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have two plants, but where are
they going to get the seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, I got an uncle who lives
in Canberra and it was when I was talking
[SPEAKER_04]: to him, he sort of painted how
logistically challenging it is because I
[SPEAKER_04]: was like, Oh, you know, I'll send you down
this sick clone I've got.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, why?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's definitely better than
whatever you got.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, Oh, yeah, but like,
then I can't keep a clone of the current
[SPEAKER_04]: one I'm running.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I can flower one out and keep one
clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's like, that's all I can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I realized very quickly,
I was like, you can't like, you can't grow
[SPEAKER_04]: anything new because if you even pop one
new seed, you can't keep a clone of the
[SPEAKER_04]: other thing you were running.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, so that's gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, it really does paint you in a
corner, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're law abiding like that guy,
I've never really been like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look, I only ever abide the law
myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think that I'm maybe a couple of
plants over the count at the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess the question then needs to be
asked, what to you would be an acceptable
[SPEAKER_04]: medical system?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that in an ideal world,
you know, we can grow as many plants as we
[SPEAKER_04]: want, and we can go nuts and have fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think would be like a
realistic proposition that you would be
[SPEAKER_04]: able to get on board with while also
recognizing like, you know, like they're
[SPEAKER_04]: not going to give us infinite plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what's the happy medium in your
opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just what they did in Thailand recently is
a bit of an example of what they,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, six plants you can grow at home,
treat yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think Australia is crazy where
only the doctor's allowed to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine because you have no idea because
you're an idiot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to whack in at what
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's wrong with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't, you don't have to pay
anyone to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why should we have to go to a doctor and
get a bloody script to get stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we know we've studied it and we know
what's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to treat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know where to get the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't we?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'd like to be able to see
people doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not idiots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what's good for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, you know, that's the sort
of thing I'd like to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm worried that, to be honest with
legality here, that we could end up in a
[SPEAKER_00]: situation where growing a few plants is
worse than it is now, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that could happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real, real issue where,
you know, the government's mates are all
[SPEAKER_00]: making money selling pot, but you can't
even grow a few yourself because you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: bloody big trouble, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remembered when they legalized those two
plants in ACT, I said to my buddies,
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, you watch, they're going to come
out now and say, now that we've legalized
[SPEAKER_04]: it, anyone who's genuinely needing
cannabis will do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And anyone who grows more than that is a
dirty criminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can't grow tobacco,
obviously, because that's really frowned
[SPEAKER_00]: upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And possession of large amounts of
tobacco, that's a federal offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in big trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in worse trouble than if they found
you with a pound of weed, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm worried about what
might happen with weed in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, let's say you want to grow for
everybody else, but you don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: license and you get caught doing it,
then you're in deep shit, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, it would be, it would be super
concerning if that happened, didn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially because yeah, Australia has got
such a hard on for like tightly regulated
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical dispensing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I mean, on the one hand,
it's good, I think, that Australia has
[SPEAKER_04]: that grip on the pharmaceutical dispensing
because it's stops pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_04]: industries from like bribing doctors and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But on the other hand, it gives that
point, you said, where it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's so many checks and hurdles that
you have to go to a doctor to grow a plant
[SPEAKER_04]: that you know is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're so tight with some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that they want to do things
properly, but the rest of the world's done
[SPEAKER_00]: 350 studies and they've come up with
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got to, you know,
we've got to do exactly the same study and
[SPEAKER_00]: we come up with the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, gosh.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish we could go back to like back in
California when they had the two 15 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I think that model is the dream,
but sadly I'm not convinced it'll ever
[SPEAKER_04]: happen in Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, yeah, where people can just like
grow at their house and go to a dispensary
[SPEAKER_04]: and sell their product to a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then like, like what medical was for
the longest time in sort of California,
[SPEAKER_04]: that would be the dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but yeah, who knows whether it'll
actually happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean on the tail end of the legality
side, you mentioned earlier, you got
[SPEAKER_04]: busted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any chance you'd be willing to
tell us a little bit about what happened
[SPEAKER_04]: or what sort of punishment you faced?
[SPEAKER_00]: I broke that rule that you mentioned
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that's what they were doing,
but that led to me getting busted and
[SPEAKER_00]: twice quite a lot, quite large amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both times and I'm still in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even as far as like legal growing and
that went, I probably wouldn't be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that for quite a while yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they shut us down for quite a
while, at least five years, maybe it might
[SPEAKER_00]: be 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mentioned that to someone the other
day who's got some legal stuff going on
[SPEAKER_00]: down South and said that I probably
wouldn't be even allowed into one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, well, they're not guarding
you on the way through the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no one checking your ID or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go in, have a look around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I don't think I'll be a
candidate to grow legally for quite some
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I was thinking about it myself when
you mentioned that to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought maybe in the future it will
become more possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've interacted with a few of the legal
grows in Australia and I know that the
[SPEAKER_04]: majority of them are being operated by
people with virtually zero cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: experience, but just have been able to get
the financial backing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of those companies are producing
very lackluster results that even they
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves are acknowledging is not good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think maybe in a few years,
once they've lost enough money,
[SPEAKER_04]: they'll be like, maybe we should get
someone in here who can actually grow
[SPEAKER_04]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think they would eventually come to
that conclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's frustrating, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm talking about this for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping that you get a call because it
would be a shame for your talents to go to
[SPEAKER_04]: waste in that respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd definitely do it, but there'd
want to be some reasonable money in it
[SPEAKER_00]: though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they make pretty good money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen the price of medicinal weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when it first came out and it
was like 900 an ounce from the pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think now you can get reasonably good
quality for about 500 an ounce from the
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmacy, but you're sort of like for a
legal system.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hoping the price point might've.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially since you can go down the road
and get something better, cheaper,
[SPEAKER_00]: black market.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next question I had for you,
and this was something I was really
[SPEAKER_04]: interested to ask you was, I'm always
asking myself more than anything,
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to be regarded as someone who
helped progress the Australian scene in
[SPEAKER_04]: some form or another.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I thought I should ask you that
exact question.
[SPEAKER_04]: What to you do you think is the most
impactful thing the average person can do
[SPEAKER_04]: to help progress the scene?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that maybe for example,
it's like getting online and networking
[SPEAKER_04]: and just like trying to like, you know,
like build that network or do you think
[SPEAKER_04]: like, for example, for a long time,
I've always told people just keep pheno
[SPEAKER_04]: hunting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when you pheno hunt, you find new
special plants and it makes the scene
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what do you think is the best thing
someone can do?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's got different skills,
don't they?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got different stuff to give.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are way better at talking than
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are just gardeners and they
want to be left alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever they're good at, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: More, you know, wide spectrum than I
expected.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess maybe I can make it a bit more
specific for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think is the most impactful
thing you did for the scene?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just become involved, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've shared a lot of seeds and connected
people together, that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that helps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely, definitely, definitely,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, as a curiosity, what's your
thoughts on pheno hunting?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you the sort of person who's like
always keen to crack some new seeds or are
[SPEAKER_04]: you pretty content just running from
clone?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do you sit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I think it's exciting cracking new
stuff all the time, don't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's the spice of life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like and it's an interesting one
because it then goes next into this
[SPEAKER_04]: conversation of like, some people don't
like the fact I say this, but in
[SPEAKER_04]: Australia, at least, I always say that I
recommend people have a day job and don't
[SPEAKER_04]: grow for a living because I feel like
whenever I meet someone who's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, you know, I would really love to grow
something new, but I've got this strain I
[SPEAKER_04]: grow and I have to yield 4p in order to
pay the bills and, you know, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_04]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, oh, you've sort of backed
yourself into a corner with your hobby
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's no longer your hobby.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's now paying your bills and thus you
don't have that freedom to maybe pop some
[SPEAKER_04]: Zoid fuel or something new that maybe
doesn't quite yield as much, but in the
[SPEAKER_04]: long term could be like really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've always felt like that's been a
good bit of advice because the people I
[SPEAKER_04]: know who do really good pheno hunting and
really have fun with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: it doesn't pay their bills for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like maybe it gives them a bit of pocket
money, but like it's not the primary
[SPEAKER_04]: income source.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your thoughts on that sentiment?
[SPEAKER_04]: Feel free to totally shoot it down if you
don't agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, maybe we need some guy that just does
that, you know, and he gets some,
[SPEAKER_00]: some money out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone pays him for his, uh,
you know, his success, his additions to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to everything because he's doing a job
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's looking for something for all
these guys that are doing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the big jobs and, um, he should be
included as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's another job, you know,
like being a, uh, paying breeders to find
[SPEAKER_00]: us better stuff, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the, the pheno hunter guy and,
uh, he should do well too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually, I say that to people all the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I say, look, just for simple numbers,
if you grow a crop and you make $10,000
[SPEAKER_04]: off it and I pop new seeds and because I'm
like pheno hunting and some of the phenos
[SPEAKER_04]: are shit and don't yield much,
like maybe I only get like $5,000 worth of
[SPEAKER_04]: crop, but I get a few new plants that are
special.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, could you not make the argument that
whatever plants I found are sort of worth
[SPEAKER_04]: $5,000, like that was the opportunity cost
for me to find those plants was like
[SPEAKER_04]: forgoing that crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people get really uptight
when they hear that because they're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, you're implying that a clone's worth
five grand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if I'm saying a clone's
worth five grand per se, but I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely saying in that theoretical
situation, someone foregoed a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: yield to find that new plant, which maybe
wasn't optimized in the setup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, what's your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't he get a percentage of what the guys
that are growing it are making,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 5% or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could, you know, cut him in on the
deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like a reasonable sort of like
middle ground, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that with the guys with seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a, an arrangement, you know,
some like to pay straight up front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some like to give a percentage of what
they get or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it works as long as we're all
getting something and we're all happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy should be cutting them as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually a really sort of a even
keeled middle ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hadn't, I hadn't thought about that too
much, but yeah, that would be good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess it inherently sort of promotes
like unity and, uh, like collaboration
[SPEAKER_04]: just by virtue of how you're doing the
transaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all working together toward,
you know, the guy at the end is smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: his stuff saying, wow, I'm glad they chose
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then that goes back to your phenome.
Yeah.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and you know what you've said is
really true.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I've been thinking about this a
lot recently and I've, I've decided to
[SPEAKER_04]: give out some of my closer guarded clones
because I thought it's all well and good
[SPEAKER_04]: for me to think this is the best shit on
earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I'm only cropping a couple of
ounces of it every few months,
[SPEAKER_04]: like who's ever going to get to taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all about that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, we've got some cuttings years ago from
overseas, which we never thought of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, at first I thought we should
guard them tightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, eventually I thought,
well, I'm going to lose them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, like I thought with the ducks
foot, I'm going to lose this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do do that, if I share and let other
people reap the rewards, the benefits or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, then when, when I lose mine,
which I will, I can get it back off
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, that's exactly what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, that way we met, I managed to
keep one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it must've been at least six years
ago that we got those cuttings and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the one I got, it's still running and
everyone's really happy and I can get it
[SPEAKER_00]: any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be pretty selfish just to keep it to
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've got it and you can't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, canvas is supposed to be
about sharing as far as I remember when I
[SPEAKER_00]: first started.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I'm, I'm slowly treading the
same path you did years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, that's cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be interested to hear what's your
thoughts on the Australian cannabis scene
[SPEAKER_04]: in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if you're on Instagram much,
but I guess from sort of what you see on
[SPEAKER_04]: the forums, I would largely describe the
Australian cannabis scene as quite similar
[SPEAKER_04]: to the American in terms of like the
trends, you know, like OG and cookies and
[SPEAKER_04]: all that is, you know, sort of popular
over here nowadays with the younger
[SPEAKER_04]: growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your thoughts on the scene from
what you see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've seen that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I not long ago on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me a minute to work out how to use
the darn thing though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like Facebook where you join a
group and there it all is, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, they're like a bunch of
kids with new toys, aren't they?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noted at the moment, they're all
trying those new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I've got Bruce Banner or
I've got cookies or, and, um, I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's cool to see, but, um,
um, I'd like to see more of them growing
[SPEAKER_00]: some stuff from like ACE seeds,
for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, those survivors of those guys bring
out, they're awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad there's someone doing that,
that there's a market that they can,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, make some money out of and,
and produce stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when I spoke to him,
he, he sold me a Louis, uh, he sold me on
[SPEAKER_04]: the Cali China.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, Oh, send me some now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm like with a few of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did grow some crosses a guy made with
some of their stuff and, uh, it was
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to see that on and that there's
enough people around, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing that sort of stuff that,
uh, it's, it's becoming more popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It even seems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, hugely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like Hayes, you know, someone said
it the other day and it made sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they said, whether it's really
related or not seems like since Neville's
[SPEAKER_04]: passing the demand for Hayes is definitely
feels more apparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a reemergence lately,
hasn't there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of discussion on the
forums where I go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit heated mind you,
but I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you talk to Australians about,
you know what, I'm going to actually
[SPEAKER_04]: rephrase this.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you talk to international,
about Australian weed, a lot of them talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about, you know, uh, Nimbin, the Emerald
triangle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think of far, do you think of far
Northern rivers, New South Wales as the
[SPEAKER_04]: Emerald triangle of Australia,
or do you feel like there's actually a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of other areas that produce a lot and just
don't really have the namesake?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess I will add the caveat that,
you know, I haven't been to Nimbin in a
[SPEAKER_04]: number of years, but whenever I do go
there, I'm largely unimpressed,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, slash disappointed, you know,
where, where do you stand on it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you think Nimbin gets hyped?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I was pretty disappointed with the
stuff they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need some more input, more,
more seed, you know, better stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a not bad climate there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I'm sure they got a name for a
reason initially, but yeah, I think those
[SPEAKER_00]: days are gone and they really need to step
up a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was a kid, uh, up here,
where I live was pretty famous for the
[SPEAKER_00]: best weed in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, North Queensland heads, everyone loved
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, if you had a bag of that,
you'd sell out in minutes sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was pretty popular stuff and,
um, strong, you know, but I, I think
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the, uh, lack of imports,
you know, when the import market died and
[SPEAKER_00]: no one could make any decent seed,
they couldn't inbreed it well or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, um, the market kind of collapsed a
bit and, uh, they ended up with a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like, and maybe that's what's
going on down in them too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need new input, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I definitely agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: They need some new seed there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it's pretty stagnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to have some friends around here
locally that, um, they grew some stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: from India and, uh, it was kind of like
brown bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't brown from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being ruined.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I ran around there and they
smoked out a big chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was bloody awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually put a lot of weed in that chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must've been like seven grams or
something in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like all the fire came out of the top
of that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you puffed on it was huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I was sitting on a chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to go and sit on against the wall
because I felt like I was going to fall
[SPEAKER_00]: off my chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was that smashed, you know, and I asked
them about, uh, seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said they had to go back to India
every year, uh, because they tried making
[SPEAKER_00]: their own and they failed every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said they couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just better to go back to the
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I guess, uh, in breeding some of
those things, just unless you're
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledgeable or whatever, or you've got
enough plants or it just doesn't seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it's not a lot of people,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, uh, we might move on to some of
the fan submitted questions at this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, from a fellow Aussie bin chicken,
he asks, uh, for the Z99, would you
[SPEAKER_04]: consider giving it a modern twist in like
a sort of a hybrid reformed, or would you
[SPEAKER_04]: just want to bring it back as you have it
now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did recreate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also gave it a modern twist and
crossed it with, uh, East Coast sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sour Z99.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, that was pretty well received by
the guys that have grown it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like, you were ahead of the game on
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew you haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that question was coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but that's like, that's the perfect
cross as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like sour to the Z99 is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did use that sour a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some XAML too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard of XAML, Xamal, XAML.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The mythical LSD effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty good pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so I, and it's, it had a really
weird smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of like tea tree oil,
charity tea tree oil strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty robust sort of aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I did the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I crossed it with sour diesel because why
not use that thing when you've got a day
[SPEAKER_00]: and, um, it was super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was, it was a great cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I crossed it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got like a double sour XAML.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I've had some guys send me
pictures of these huge big colas they've
[SPEAKER_00]: grown with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're reasonably happy too,
it seems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's a good answer to that
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so the next question we got was from
my buddy, Goodie Garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he wanted to know, as far as,
you know, is there any difference between
[SPEAKER_04]: duck's foot and another strain that they
call Mongi madness?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought Mongi was ABC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I might've heard that term used as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe it is ABC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's one of the guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he said he originally was the guy
that bounded off some old people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I seem to recall reading and he,
Hey, I think he did a bunch of crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: with it because I think he said it was,
wasn't very potent, but I, I recall him
[SPEAKER_00]: saying he did up the potency, whether that
happened or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote to him once because there seemed
to be an interest in it and I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: get some to spread it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think he was concerned with people
making money out of something that he
[SPEAKER_00]: hadn't made anything out of or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would have just given it away,
but I can understand where he was at,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, uh, why couldn't he just do it and
make some money out of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I remember me and Gene, you know,
a famous breeder who's been on the show
[SPEAKER_04]: said, you know, just like, just get one or
two steps of a project under your belt and
[SPEAKER_04]: then you can let it go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if like your fear of someone
trying to rush to market happens,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're already one or two steps ahead of
them, you know, like, so, or do a deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with them over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to them and say, look, do you want to
give us a little bit of something or
[SPEAKER_00]: another?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: CoLab is the way to go for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next question, sorry, go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they could send me some money if they
wanted to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next question we got was from our
Patreon listener, Felix.
[SPEAKER_04]: He says it would be great to hear Wally
talk a little bit about the grail haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's start there.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your thoughts on the grail haze?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that something that Neville was doing
with Kanga or?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what steps he ended up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think someone sells some of that,
that seed still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, and I'm sure it must be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I tried some, um, cross with,
uh, it was a mullum cross with tie and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a dispute over what tie it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I won't get into that, but,
uh, it was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did remind me a lot of tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that golden tie that I mentioned
earlier, uh, it reminded me of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I've seen that poster.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're referring to, I think it's its own
cattle of fish, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: With that tie.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the follow-up part, Felix asked was,
what are your thoughts around why we're
[SPEAKER_04]: seeing the resurgence of interest in the
long flowering sativas and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the real trippy sort of weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: People are finally coming to their senses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just so hard to grow for everyone
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I've seen some LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows recently with sativas and I think
they're getting a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really starting to, you know,
look a bit more like, like you'd see them
[SPEAKER_00]: in their, in their home setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it's pretty promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe it's not far down the track
and they'll be able to get the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors that you can if you grew them in a
tropical place.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, one, one could only hope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so, and I, I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, as someone who's growing some sativas
under some LEDs at the moment,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're, they're actually doing a really
good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, uh, we're going to have to talk later
about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to, maybe we can, we can do our own
little collab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got these, these strains I'm running at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're called Azazel and, uh,
there's a lot of different genetics in
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's made by a cool breeder called Always
Be Flowering, but it basically,
[SPEAKER_04]: one half of it is Ace Seeds Genetics,
Purple Haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's tie across to the Purple Haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the mother.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the father is like, uh,
granddaddy perps, chem dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like new school meets old school,
but they're very sativa leaning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, I'll get you some photos,
but I'll also, maybe we can talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: some seed stuff later, but, um,
we'll put that on the back burner for the
[SPEAKER_04]: moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next question we got was someone who
was wondering, it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you still hold any of what you would
consider your original C99?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they were sort of saying,
you know, like there's so many different
[SPEAKER_04]: C99s on the market now, be it Brothers
Grimm C99, the new Brothers Grimm C99,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's like a, a Fast Bud C9,
like, you know, there's like a million
[SPEAKER_04]: C99s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you still have the one that you think
is the original and what to you is the
[SPEAKER_04]: best one?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's, that's long gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was so many years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I did get offered some recently
by a guy and I think it was original
[SPEAKER_00]: Brothers Grimm stuff, maybe, you know,
down the track a few generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I would, I, I told him I'd take
it because even though I thought that that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, uh, that stuff that you built
tolerance to it reasonably quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, um, we're still delicious pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially that pineapple like we spoke
about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, but no, I don't have any C99.
[SPEAKER_00]: Z99.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to send you some of the
new C99 F2s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I've got a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friend made them for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was interested to know what day would
you harvest C99?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what I found to be the most
interesting thing about the whole C99
[SPEAKER_04]: story was when I went to, I actually spent
some time in Colorado and went to the
[SPEAKER_04]: Brothers Grimm facility and they were kind
enough to let me come there for a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the most interesting part about it all
was Rick, Mr. Soll said, Oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like we used to say, you know,
day 49, day 49.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and you could harvest it on day 49,
but you know, now that we understand how
[SPEAKER_04]: to grow wheat a bit better, it's probably
like 58 to 62.
[SPEAKER_04]: When did you have a C99?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just thinking that as you were
asking the question now, I think 60 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we used to harvest some at 49 days
because it was ready enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the high was better if you waited
a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny you say that because that's
exactly what Mr. Soll said.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, you know, like the smell and the
flavor and the effect was there at 49,
[SPEAKER_04]: but at 60, it was like stronger.
[SPEAKER_04]: It lasted longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so yeah, more enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't that you got a flavor at day 60
that wasn't there at 49.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's why people thought it was
49, but yeah, just the effect,
[SPEAKER_04]: the legs on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just way better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people pull stuff early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down in Adelaide, they grow a lot of stuff
and they pull it at eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one guy said they, uh, they made a
mistake once and it went 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so much better, you know,
but they can't afford to wait 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were still always pulling it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it was Jack Herra.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been Jack Herra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but they still didn't learn and then
do 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I said this to someone the other
night on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, I can't really think of one plant
I absolutely love that finishes quicker
[SPEAKER_04]: than nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, some guy, one of the guys on the net
said he wouldn't even smoke anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: flowed under 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Puritan.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so the next question we got was,
um, I would love to know about some of
[SPEAKER_04]: Wally's favorite pure sativas or just
narrow leaf drug types in general,
[SPEAKER_04]: particularly within the Southeast Asian,
you know, any specific ties or,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, I'll just sort of let you answer that
so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, like pure sativas, what,
what's up there for you in terms of what
[SPEAKER_04]: you rate as high quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like most of them, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I've grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have grown some pure Colombian and it
was pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of a bit different to the tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, even in its growth, it's got wider
than it did tall ties get quite tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, I think what you grow up with
tends to be what your favor is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's what I found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tie was typically my go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I'd happily try all the rest of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did like some of that Indian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, that was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what, what sort of Indian it
was, but I think they were going to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern part of India.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could have been similar to that
Kerala is a Kerala.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been similar to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't know though.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably a fair bit of weed in
India.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really interesting to hear that
that sort of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've stimulated this thought in my
mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone says that the weed you grew up
with is what's most memorable to you,
[SPEAKER_04]: but there's sadly a whole generation,
maybe even two generations of young
[SPEAKER_04]: Australians who all the weed they know
literally is, uh, like PGR riddled.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beast is equivalent.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a lot of people say,
oh, you know, it's, it's Vietnamese gangs
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know, you hear lines like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what they're doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel like there's any way we can
change this at all within the Australian
[SPEAKER_04]: landscape where it's just like going to be
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think legalisation is the only way
they're going to change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's those Asian gangs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see all the time, a bigger,
bigger and bigger bust of greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen on the news and we'd like to
put a stop to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Busting them hasn't stopped them has it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's every, every other week.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another one, you know,
and wouldn't they rather see the money
[SPEAKER_00]: going to Aussie pockets?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but yeah, with the PGR stuff here,
we did get some, we bought some weed from
[SPEAKER_00]: Adelaide for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so it was that Jack Harrah,
which we really quite liked, but then they
[SPEAKER_00]: grew this other stuff they called,
uh, Himalayan, Himalayan Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was that you've probably heard of
it as large buds, really big orange hairs
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't get you high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got you low.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just that strain they use in all the cash
cropping facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of, uh, young people, they actually
like that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their interpretation of what weed
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That, that's all they've ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: How sad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like that, that was what,
so the day I decided to start growing weed
[SPEAKER_04]: was the day I had a weed sample that
wasn't that bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I, some, one of my buddies was like
real, real technologically advanced.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in 2010, he, um, he gave me this bud
and he said, Oh, that's granddaddy purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's imported from California.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, Oh yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've smoked weed before, you know,
like I've smoked Aussie weed and I tried
[SPEAKER_04]: it and it was just, it just changed my
life.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like it opened my eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, wow, you can grow weed like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The boys around here, my son, I've got a
son who's about 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, their memories of the weed is the
weed we used to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, Oh, that diesel member, that diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a lucky boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where he was a teenager stealing my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't believe that Ash and the Weedy
used to steal and thinking about other
[SPEAKER_00]: people who had nothing in this boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're out there getting, uh,
acid off a bear, you know, bear from the
[SPEAKER_00]: great pool dead, the manager, they're
getting hit acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard the name yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're getting a weed and hash off
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of what an upbringing these guys
are having.
[SPEAKER_04]: God, the stuff of legends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually just talking to a mate the
other day and I said, I think one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: purest acts of love you can do as a
cannabis grower is to be able to leave
[SPEAKER_04]: your children a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I always think about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like whenever I have a guest on the show,
and they're like, Oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: some seeds I got off my dad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, Oh, I wish I had some seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got off my dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My son would say, well, give us a bag now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll, I'll start with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next part of this person's question
was, you know, they're asking about the,
[SPEAKER_04]: like the favorite sativas and narrow leaf
drug types.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said, I'm probably going to
butcher the pronunciation here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just bear with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they basically say, do you have any
details on the Hmong Hill tribe tie?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it actually from Hmong or is it Hmong?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how you pronounce it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard it's just actually a fancy name
and it actually came from a guy called
[SPEAKER_04]: Prof 77 who lives in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know, is it actually a land race or
is it just from someone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's absolutely from Prof 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went and visited him twice in central
Thailand there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked his wife recently,
he died.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked his wife, but she didn't go
into much detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said that she got it off her father,
that tie, and their family grew weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was basically what I got out of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't even know where the Hmong part
of it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never said that to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have said it to one of the guys
they gave it to, which was Kanga's friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I never heard Hmong mentioned,
but that seed is, I've shared that with
[SPEAKER_00]: someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent that to someone and they've done a
remake of it and then share it with other
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where that seed come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've probably still got some of it
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's originally from Prof 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to hear them mentioning the Prof
77.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the important part, that the guy
that shared it gets a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kudos to our listeners.
[SPEAKER_04]: My listeners are only scholars and high
quality intellectuals.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but that's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to our fellow historians.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've just made me wonder though,
when you mentioned you might have some
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds left.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to ask, because I love asking
breeders this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of all the seeds in your library,
what are the ones like your most excited
[SPEAKER_04]: about or feel are like the most rare seeds
you have, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've still got some of those loud seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must have like about 10 different label
type stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all just getting older.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this several tens of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm worried that one of them, I don't know
how many of them can be struck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I just keeping them just for a memento?
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be growing those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sad to see that happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't take very long, does it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember some of the first seeds I ever
made five, six years ago are now starting
[SPEAKER_04]: to be fully dead because I sadly wasn't
keeping them in the fridge and stuff like
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get to a point where you're like,
I sat on them to the point where it was
[SPEAKER_04]: deleterious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people with their collections and
they're really proud of what they've got,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't know if they know whether
they're going to ever grow the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: From 1908, I've got this stuff,
but is it ever going to grow?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like everyone's waiting for the fake
embryonic seeds to develop or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we'll have to see whether that
actually happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next question we got was another land
race.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to butcher it, but I'm hoping
you are going to understand the question
[SPEAKER_04]: better than I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get the vibe, you will.
[SPEAKER_04]: They say, can you ask, is Wally familiar
with Kampuchean land race honey?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's Cambodian Kampuchea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's that psychoactive
honey, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have heard of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe if you feel like you know what
they're talking about, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish it was that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely dry some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder what those bees are eating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's one of the flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's like an atropine type drug
in there, so you essentially get what we
[SPEAKER_04]: would call an anti-cholinergic reaction,
which is, I've got to admit, I remember I
[SPEAKER_04]: spoke to a very senior EDT doctor one day
and he said the most insane hallucinations
[SPEAKER_04]: I've ever seen a person having was from
that anti-cholinergic sort of effect,
[SPEAKER_04]: not from LSD.
[SPEAKER_04]: LSD makes you trip a bit, but an
anti-cholinergic delirium, people will
[SPEAKER_04]: jump out windows chasing dragons full on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's what the honey is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that flower get you high or is it the
bees?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I believe in the same sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: That like, you know, scopolamine from
Datura and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's that same sort of vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tried Datura?
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some seeds and I'm too scared to
touch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've got a growing out the back
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried it when we were kids and it can
be a little bit scary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I just remember the guy who gave me
the seeds, Mr. Bob Hemphill.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out, lovely guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was just like, oh, just make sure
you're wearing gloves when you touch them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like even just touching the seeds,
like you can get high off, apparently,
[SPEAKER_04]: like it just goes through your skin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember in PNG when we were younger,
they, they reckon that where the Datura
[SPEAKER_00]: grew around the houses there, that you
should probably rob those places because
[SPEAKER_00]: they sleep really deeply.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I guess over there in PNG,
they're using it like, I don't want to say
[SPEAKER_04]: medicinally, but like they're purposefully
ingesting it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just a kid, so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hey, tell us, tell us about your PNG
adventures.
[SPEAKER_04]: We forgot to touch on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My father got a job over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even remember what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a seaman.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like sea search and rescue,
harbor master.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sold lighthouses at one point,
which I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever come across a lighthouse
salesman?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bit of a niche one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent a couple of years there and in the
darkest parts of my life, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're feeling really down,
that's, that's the things I look back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to every day after school,
the school was across the road from the
[SPEAKER_00]: beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd wander off to the beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was low tide and we'd just spend hours
walking amongst the coral, looking for,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're actually looking for sharks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and my friend, I don't think we ever
found any, but plenty of octopuses and
[SPEAKER_00]: crabs and, you know, all the different
shapes and colors of coral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really sad to know that that
where we were, it was at Port Moresby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just not like that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been told it's horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't want to even swim in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, you know, so that was like 1974
to now, which is a fair while,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's totally ruined they reckon,
which is a bit sad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, are you familiar with the
geopolitical landscape there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I heard just, I mean, it sounds like
you were sort of talking about like the
[SPEAKER_04]: waters and the general environment,
but I've heard it maybe isn't even
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily particularly safe at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you, do you keep tracks on that at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm not sure how safe it ever was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was always, they used to walk
around with those big bush knives,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, those big bush knives.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, like a machete sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're like children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so happy and happy go lucky,
but you don't upset them because if they
[SPEAKER_00]: got angry, you know, that could be pretty
dangerous people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_04]: The diff, like it's amazing the different
culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cultural differences.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I remember when I was doing some
volunteering at a school, helping tutor
[SPEAKER_04]: some refugee students, just to try to help
catch them up to sort of the same level
[SPEAKER_04]: as, you know, like what someone in year
four in Australia, you would sort of be
[SPEAKER_04]: expected to be at that level or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember they were telling me,
cause there was a few of them that had
[SPEAKER_04]: like, were from P and G and they had like
a lot of scars on their arms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, Oh, what's that from?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were like, Oh, you know,
like in my culture, like we often settle
[SPEAKER_04]: like family disputes with just like small
knife fights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You reckon it's true as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they're pretty brutal sometimes and so
strong and the injuries that I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: them and get inflicted by or with and they
barely even notice it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'd be crying my eyes out or
whatever, you know, at that point,
[SPEAKER_00]: but these guys are big, big chunk of meat
comes out of their leg and they know it's
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tough people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Strong culturally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The different cultural perceptions of
pain, like in some cultures, like pain is
[SPEAKER_04]: like a good thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like religious experience on this,
but there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thanks for the experience on the P
and G and it ties in well, because one of
[SPEAKER_04]: our listeners wanted to know that they had
read online a while ago, many years ago
[SPEAKER_04]: that you were selling P and G.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think P and G has had a bit of a
revival in terms of its popularity.
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you describe that strain?
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you say like, you know, it's largely
like the other sort of Southeast Asian
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties or what makes it unique for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I ever sold any.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a mate that was over there to try
and collect some seeds, but they were,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've still got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I ever got any to strike,
but a friend of mine has grown some since
[SPEAKER_00]: that he got directly from P and G and they
were all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, I don't, but I did grow some when
I was younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of my first indoor experiences
and it was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really fruity, sticky, top,
top glass weed, P and G gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, you know, things that stick
in your memory are the ones that things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can still almost remember the smell
of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd absolutely grow that stuff again,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have seed banks or do you know
what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have ways of keeping stuff to
be able to get that stuff again from when
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be pretty hard pressed to get it,
I should think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you've made me realize that,
yeah, you don't think about the logistics
[SPEAKER_04]: of like, yeah, they don't have little
baggies over there or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It all sort of plays into the picture,
doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're just growing what they can
and, you know, remaking seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did talk to a guy that studied P and G
cannabis, Ben Thomas, I think his name
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke with him for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: He thought I was like a qualified
scientist or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted me to do a journey over there
funded by the government to go and study
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, which I said, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to do that, but I'm not the guy
you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a bit of a stoner guy,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to.
[SPEAKER_00]: He put out a paper at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it online somewhere, I'm pretty
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he thinks it was, they did some tests
and it was one of the strongest sativists
[SPEAKER_00]: that came in at like 16% TAC, which for a
land race sativa, that is pretty high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's special.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to have to go look for that
paper after this chat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have a read of it, but that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next question we got was throughout
your sort of growing journey, did you ever
[SPEAKER_04]: struggle with anxiety related to the law?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, were you ever particularly concerned
about the law coming and busting you or
[SPEAKER_04]: was it just something you were never
particularly mindful of?
[SPEAKER_00]: All the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always worried about, I suffer
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and like we talked about earlier,
sometimes cannabis can help relieve that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but sometimes it exacerbates it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I was, I used to have dreams that
I was getting chased all the time by
[SPEAKER_00]: police.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it was crocodiles,
but I still think it was police,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just that idea in your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had plenty of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't seem to have it so much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still dream a little bit about cannabis
and, but not about getting caught or
[SPEAKER_00]: chased or big fields of it anymore.
So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the, the final fan submitted question
we got from our Patreon fans was,
[SPEAKER_04]: do you like ABC in terms of the effect?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that ABC could ever be a
viable commercial variety, or do you think
[SPEAKER_04]: that it's potential lies purely in the
like discretionary slash camouflage sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of aspects?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see why they couldn't do what
they've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Freak Show, I'm not even a hundred
percent sure Freak Show isn't related to
[SPEAKER_00]: ABC because we grew a few and some of them
look very similar, the sort of leaf that
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason why you can't cross that
to a really potent variety and make some
[SPEAKER_00]: F2s and then select some, you know,
freaky looking leaf ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely no reason why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then have your camouflage,
you know, UK can hit it too, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend wanted to make, I think he's
halfway through making some freaky bastard
[SPEAKER_00]: ducks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: The trifecta.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something for us to all keep our eyes out
for.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're now moving on to what we call the
final five questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So first question, what is the best or
single most memorable experience relating
[SPEAKER_04]: to cannabis you've ever had?
[SPEAKER_00]: That isn't an easy one, is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been so many.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've done it for so long that I
couldn't really pinpoint one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just used to love getting really high
and, you know, forgetting my worries,
[SPEAKER_00]: load off, load off your mind, you know
what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have a bit of a, when I went to
Thailand, the first time I actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might have been the second time I
smoked weed there, but I got freaked out a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a combination of jet lag
and low tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I smoked this stuff and seriously I
was spiraling down this dark tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this isn't a good experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a bad one, but I had to be,
you know, really mindful that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: actually just cannabis and it's all right,
Wally, you're going to come out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only, that's how strong some cannabis
can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really mind altering some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's one of the things that's
missing in modern cannabis actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: that aspect, you know, it's more about,
I don't know, more body and that head,
[SPEAKER_00]: that trippy sort of, you know,
hallucination-y sort of out of spiraling
[SPEAKER_00]: down dark tunnel stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's missing these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a pretty wild ride.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I was losing the plot and I kept
having to say to myself, look,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's only pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it when you got to like back
yourself off the ledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the other end of the spectrum,
what's the least memorable or most
[SPEAKER_04]: disappointing strain you ever tried that
maybe was hyped up?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, I mean, hopefully it's not
the answer, but I mean, earlier on we
[SPEAKER_04]: spoke about the Northern Lights,
you know, everyone raves, but you were
[SPEAKER_04]: like, Oh, it wasn't really our thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's something that for you was like,
didn't really live up to the hype or was
[SPEAKER_04]: just flat out really disappointing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I did a Tesco once.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Sensi Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really early days when I first come
online and got to know Gypsy and he,
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow I ended up with this Tesco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure it was Sensi Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called Gorilla's Gusto.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't, and I even had like about five
of them to choose from and I just thought
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just rubbish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't think it made a,
I don't think they released it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure other people must've found what I
found.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how, I think someone had sent
it to him and said, Oh, this is the best
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should try that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But their version of best stuff ever
versus mine just wasn't the same at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: God, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing the downfall of Sensi in front of
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do a desert island situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So theoretically, back when you were
ingesting, I'm going to drop you off on a
[SPEAKER_04]: desert island with just three strains of
cannabis for the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_04]: What three are you going to take with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure I'd take that Lao stuff
that I was talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I'm going to have a,
a hybrid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made some with mango haze,
Lao cross with mango haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mango haze is one of my favorites,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so probably take that with me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess there's days where you want to
dribble on your shirt and lay on the couch
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe take a bit of indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't grown a lot of indicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've recently grown a bit of sour bubble
of bogs though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, bog sour bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very indica-y looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't smoke it because I'm not smoking
anymore, but it's got to have like some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the largest leaf I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a big palm leaf and not very
vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just grew small.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you flouted, it didn't really stretch
out or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how ratio of indica it is,
but it looked pretty bloody indica to me
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the fibers I was growing,
you know, in the hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a hundred percent indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To dribble on your shirt a while and
relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be euphoric all the time,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So second last one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who is the one person from all of history
you'd love to sit down and pick their
[SPEAKER_04]: brains about cannabis, alive or dead?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'd probably, I had met Sam already in
an embarrassing situation, to be honest
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think he'd be the guy I'd want to
talk to more.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'd tend to agree with you on that
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think our buddy Jingles has a lot of
interesting info for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So final question for our chat today.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could go back in time to anywhere,
any place to collect either some seeds or
[SPEAKER_04]: some clones, where would you go?
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got a time machine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take you wherever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'd definitely go get some of that
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like some of that first import stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'd like to go into my own
timeline and go and get some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: webbed hybrid stuff and the old duckswood
that I had too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the stuff I had when I was younger
too, you know, memories.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think that pretty well brings us
to the end of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Were there any general comments or shout
outs you'd like to make?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a general shout out to the community
who I've been a part of for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the people I've met through forums
and that, they just give you a refreshed
[SPEAKER_00]: vision of how good people can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generous and kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some bloody good people out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can definitely back that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a lot of really good people
looking to help each other out exist in
[SPEAKER_04]: the scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't get bogged down thinking it's all
profiteering.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I've got messages from people to just
say, are you okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you feeling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you good?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fancy someone putting out a bit out of
their day just to make sure you feel okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some good people in the cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
