[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a really nice looking cup of
coffee here, so hopefully, hopefully we're
[SPEAKER_00]: both good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my second favorite thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome to the next episode of
The Podcast, a cannabis podcast for
[SPEAKER_00]: budding enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode, as always, was brought to
you by 420 Australia, your premier store
[SPEAKER_00]: for lifestyle and apparel, as well as
Organic Gardening Solutions, your number
[SPEAKER_00]: one stop for all things organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, CTN Now, you know,
best in the game, germination and
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfaction guaranteed, not just the
former.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this episode, we're speaking to the
rare and mythical gooey breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavily requested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty, so a big thank you and welcome
to the infamous gooey breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate this opportunity to
visit with you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to do a little curveball
first question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you currently smoking on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, mom gooey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just loaded a fresh bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that like just typical or is it you've
been experimenting a little bit lately?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that I the way that I smoke is I
this is really hard to explain,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I always use gooey as a reset because
gooey for me is really strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always been strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's going to be 35 years old this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a good gauge because then I
can go off of that onto the test plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that I do because with so much I need to
have a constant that I can say,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I like this because I like everything
about mom gooey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it's such a popular strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess before we jump into kind of the
vault of mom gooey, let's go all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it like when you first
experienced cannabis and what was the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis scene like back then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was introduced to it at a very
tender young age, and I still remember
[SPEAKER_01]: that day very vividly.
[SPEAKER_01]: A friend of mine had saw his older brother
doing it and laugh and enjoy himself and
[SPEAKER_01]: have a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he thought it'd be kind of fun to bring
it over to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my friend of mine that I hung
out with all the time and this guy we just
[SPEAKER_01]: call kind of cohorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went ahead and we took one of the
old style plastic bubble pipes and and
[SPEAKER_01]: some matches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of this stuff and he had had
quite a little bit for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't believe he took what he took,
but I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that much about it,
but it seemed like a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, we put that in that plastic bubble
pipe and smoked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't really seem like there was doing
that much, but we were at the top of this
[SPEAKER_01]: huge grassy hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember just running up and down
that hill, just go up to the top and roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold down laughing and laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then later on, we kind of understood
that that was that was the initial
[SPEAKER_01]: feelings.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I I was an Air Force brat,
so I moved around a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, I realized that,
you know, I kind of needed to make sure I
[SPEAKER_01]: could have it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And gosh darn, this stuff has seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was 13, I thought, hey,
you know what this has seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why am I looking for it or why don't I
just grow it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I come from a agricultural based
family out here in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we went ahead and I would get seed
and mix it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time I was 15 or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing pretty good, I was living in
Nebraska at that point, and it grows wild
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured out real quick that you could
just kind of hollow out a patch of the
[SPEAKER_01]: wild, throw in the good seed and just let
it go through nature's course and come
[SPEAKER_01]: back at the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was seeded with the hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: But who cares?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was better than nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and then moving to England after that
had two years of not being able to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: anything because you can't grow much in
England outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then, in the 70s, it seemed to rain
half of the time after the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was rainy and dreary and I
didn't have much luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but there were some integral parts
before then that made up gooey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we can we can touch on that
if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's those are the those are the
basic beginnings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within that are the beginnings of the
gooey mom that is so popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as in you were collecting the seed
stock over that time period?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what the fun here's the fun part
about gooey that I've told this over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go on to Breed Bay, I'm sure,
and find it at other places, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was a short interim time before
going over to England, where I was in New
[SPEAKER_01]: York City and I was there for a long
enough period of time that I was able to
[SPEAKER_01]: acquire some of the local fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during that time, the founder of High
Times had smuggled in this gold Colombian
[SPEAKER_01]: pot that nobody had ever seen gold pot
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were having a real hard time
getting rid of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they developed this magazine called
High Times to help sell that pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the centerfolds of one of the
very first issue or the subsequent second
[SPEAKER_01]: issue was this huge room full of this 700
pounds of pot with a girl laying on top of
[SPEAKER_01]: it smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some of that pot from some friends
of mine in New York at that time who were
[SPEAKER_01]: started seeing this and thought,
OK, this is interesting and good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that that turned into the Colombian
gold portion of mom gooey that started the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole thing, because then soon after that,
the golds became popular and I had got a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of local gold and that went into it,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the seeds that I tried to
take over to England.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to hold on to what I had until I
got back to the United States and to
[SPEAKER_01]: California, because that's where I came
back to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it started developing gooey at that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went through other additions and it
went from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the Colombian gold first hit New
York, it was like no one wanted it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, because you were saying they were
having trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, they'd never seen gold pot
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was odd.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and they were having a hard time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, dealers didn't want to see that
everything was brown back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's this gold stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's what's been what's been done to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's you know, it was just a it just
wasn't turning over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they developed High Times magazine
just for that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can look that up and it's all true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the very beginnings of gooey,
you know, very beginnings of the gooey
[SPEAKER_01]: mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been people really love her.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have to tell you that I get more
requests and compliments on that one plant
[SPEAKER_01]: than virtually anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's hard, hard to say, because
there's some really pretty stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: folks have really enjoyed, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nothing gets in like mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so that's what it's a very important
thing, because those are all old school
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all made up from stuff that just
doesn't exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what makes it so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you started to make gooey,
was it like an intentional transition into
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding or were you just kind of making
seed for yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, I was just making seed for
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, of course, you know,
I started to get a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: educated and I started to understand more
that manipulation was within my grasp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I did find something that was out
of the ordinary or something that really
[SPEAKER_01]: turned me on that I wanted to add,
I realized that I could, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: build it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm very blessed to be able to be very
picky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and so I learned that I
could focus in on what I needed and how to
[SPEAKER_01]: find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Luther Burbank really helped along
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luther said, you know, choose one trait
and, you know, shun all the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's basically how I breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you did first start making gooey and
you kind of started to get more a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: cluey about what you were doing around
that time period, did you know of anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: else who was trying to do it on that same
level, like like trying to take it real
[SPEAKER_00]: seriously?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like were there any other breeders or you
just kind of really isolated?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in my own little world,
as far as that goes, I add I'll tell you,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a funny story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a point where I was in Arizona and I
had two plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can only have two plants in this one
spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really hairy in Arizona and I
was really scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And due to the heat and all that stuff,
it's very challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I ended up losing one of the plants
and it turned out that it was probably the
[SPEAKER_01]: male that I lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I only ended up with this female and I
kept waiting for seeds to come about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I was just used to seeded pod,
didn't know anything about any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this thing just kept going and going
and going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, when I picked it,
it was just this beautiful seedless plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that I just thought, wow, this is very
unusual and there's no seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like this a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then I thought I invented Sensemia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, oh my gosh, you know,
what a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I did some more reading, of course,
and then found out that no, this has been
[SPEAKER_01]: going on for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Chinese has done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so anyway, after that humbling
little revelation, I went ahead and built
[SPEAKER_01]: on that and said, well, this is really
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right about that year or the next year
after that, Sensemia became the really big
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the thing and it took off from
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was right at the very beginnings of
when the seed banks were starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: advertise and get out there from the
Dutch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was right in that time.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did this revelation hamper your breeding
efforts at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like on the one hand, you're
making GUI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no, I have more seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I just found out what it was that I
had done, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now I now I could do it
intentionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, now I knew how to control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's just like any other
learning process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a simple thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: In retrospect, you know, duh.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're 15 and you're the only one
who's growing it intentionally,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's it's it's it's a little really
interesting thing that really started me.
[SPEAKER_01]: My my my father looked at me once and he
said, you know, why is it you want to know
[SPEAKER_01]: so much about pot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, can't you do something,
you know, more constructive?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, I bring that up to him now and I
said, you know why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, pan of.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're you're you're drawn to
what you're drawn to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this happens to be what God put me
here for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm trying to do the best I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the work speaks for itself,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go back, if we go back to the MAM
GUI for a moment, though, how did you get
[SPEAKER_00]: the other parts of the puzzle?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the the tie and the Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a lot of questions about the Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, tell us because you say you got
it from the source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what's the backstory behind that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, well, here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known a lot of friends in the islands
for all my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was turned on to this gentleman who
in 1972 developed what he called Wally on
[SPEAKER_01]: Maui.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a beautiful strain,
really, definitely Asian genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: but with a twist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he he never really could tell me
exactly what that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the other twist was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in it, it was obviously now and in
looking back at it, it was obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: either a Pakistan that had been brought
onto the islands or it was an Afghan.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those two, I lean more towards the
Pakistani just by the way mom stacks from
[SPEAKER_01]: it, because that's a lot of where she
picked that up from when most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic that are in GUI are heavily sativa
and they were tall and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sativas in stature and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after the Maui is introduced,
because that was the second to the last
[SPEAKER_01]: component that was introduced into that
with the tie being the last.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really kind of set the structure in a
very tight and completely changed way from
[SPEAKER_01]: what I was used to for the years before
when breathing in with the Colombians and
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really I saw the change after I
really like the change because it didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: take away from the, you know, the central
point, but it just made it made the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: so much easier to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It quickened it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: GUI's GUI's got a six from six and a half
weeks on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be picked and it varies a lot in
the medicine that it produces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you get radically different
stages, and this is one of the benefits of
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant, because early on it's good for
some ailments and late stages,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's good for completely different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all from the same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually need to outline that more
online and kind of help people to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that it's been lauded as a
wonderful strain for nerve pain and for
[SPEAKER_01]: migraines, things like that that are I
really look forward to expanding on that
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge out there and getting folks
tuned into that so that they can help
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really excited that today I just got a
hold of some very old pure GUI seed that I
[SPEAKER_01]: had made prior to let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think these are 2009 and that I have two
different stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get to go back and I get to revisit
it because I've gone through all my stocks
[SPEAKER_01]: and good old North Star.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had them, you know, in their cold
keeping spots to keep them fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's returned those to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking forward to being able to
offer people the old school pure GUI seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: which everybody just absolutely loves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can give you the description of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are the stages of GUI that are using
the old S1 skunk one as the cubing
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did you choose to use the skunk as the
male?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I did that because the skunk one
contains some of those sativa strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: the same exact ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: When skunk one was made, it's not an
indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a combination of several things and
occipable gold is one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to use that as a, you know,
reinforcer for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just seemed like the best choice
because when you know that these wildly
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy genetics pools that are out there
now, that if you can trust something,
[SPEAKER_01]: even back then, I realized, you know,
I need to trust this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the best place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've grown that strain for years
before I because I just enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, no, this is going to be
good because I know both strains very well
[SPEAKER_01]: so that I can separate what I'm looking
for and still, you know, keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: components that I think are beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says online that the stock you use
was from SSC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've spoken about them a lot on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the breeders regard them
really highly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: SSC was a really, really good company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really, really say that they were really
professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed everything, you know,
early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was into them when they first started to
go ahead and sell in high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was all over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found that they were excellent,
excellent in the quality that they put
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could trust it to some extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some things that, you know,
in retrospect that I would go,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But overall, I would just say,
you know, kudos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: They benefited the world, really,
as far as that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, interestingly, I've never really
heard anyone with who didn't like their
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love to know what did you think was
a bit missed from them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there were a couple of things like
the purple rain you could never get.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all I think they must have had it
like once and then you never were able to
[SPEAKER_01]: get it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a little bit of germination problems
with a couple of their lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I got to hesitate as to
which ones they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to really muddy their
reputation with something silly like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there were a few times where some of
the seeds I got, I questioned and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, but that was, I ordered a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody deserves a swing and a miss
now every now and then I hold no brudges
[SPEAKER_01]: at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just as a final little question on
them specifically, what was the favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: strain you grew out from them?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm just gonna have to say the
skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it really just had overall what I
really enjoyed about a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you could get phenos that were a
little bit more sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get phenos that had a little bit
more hashy flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the profiles were all basically like
really tight and really well done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just found that to be a very
consistent line.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing with the afghan one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice, really dark leaves,
wide, beautiful, perfect indica structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really quality work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting because we don't
actually see, as far as I can tell,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of afghan one pop up in your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something which is never really
interesting?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a reason for that because I
gravitate more to the sweets and that
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, those things that just stink the
place out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my breeding was always for
clandestine use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I lean towards that sweet smell
because it doesn't tend to permeate the
[SPEAKER_01]: way that the pure indicas go.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just, you know, you could smell them
a block away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so that basically is,
and I'm just a sweet pot kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just, that's where I go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's always fun to try other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing I've noticed when you go
into dispensaries nowadays and stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything smells like everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why Canada Exotics goes and
tries to split that up and to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: savory flavor, you know, of whatever I'm
trying to express the flavor and make it
[SPEAKER_01]: really unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been very lucky to be able to
achieve some of that for folks because it
[SPEAKER_01]: really does make a difference to set the
brand apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't taste like ordinary pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that gets people's interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are more into flavor than they used
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just on what you said there,
it's an interesting point you raised about
[SPEAKER_00]: the differentiation of the flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that cannabis has the ability
to produce any possible smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, given the right genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's just say that I think that the
cannabis can go a very wide range.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that it can go to any smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, it's demonstrated,
you know, everything from sweet tropicals
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got a potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how people see with science
being the way it is now and with them
[SPEAKER_01]: extracting these terpenes and then go
ahead and putting them back on and
[SPEAKER_01]: copulous amounts that muddies the waters.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for straight up breeding, I think that
if you find a flavor, you can amplify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I let's just put it like that,
because that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use some strains as amplifiers for
another flavor that's not like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a totally different flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe I want to bring it out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are certain strains that I use to
do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they act like loud speakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just look for those phenos
that the target taste is predominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just use that and bring it
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you kind of say that your primary
attribute you breed towards at the moment
[SPEAKER_00]: would be specific flavor, or is each
project a little different?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are tons of projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm dealing with a company in Colorado
that for legal reasons, I can't give them
[SPEAKER_01]: any details.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this company has asked me to develop a
line for them for mechanical harvesting,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're developing a mechanical
harvester to do things on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have discovered that,
of course, if you have a specific type of
[SPEAKER_01]: structure built into a plant, that it
makes a difference in how the machines do
[SPEAKER_01]: their job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've been asked to develop a very
strict type of plant that accomplishes
[SPEAKER_01]: this for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they've just have gotten the second
series of prototype target plants to see
[SPEAKER_01]: if they work for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first couple were just what they
wanted, and then they just wanted to add
[SPEAKER_01]: some different components, namely purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted them purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some really kind of specialized
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do that type of thing a lot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of where I think there's a
couple of different things that are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be crucial for people to keep in mind
in the coming years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the industry is going and targeted
skills and industries like that are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be more apt to be around longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good old days of people just being
able to grow and do what they want and
[SPEAKER_01]: make do with what that are basically going
to go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's only going to be the people that
really I think have a long history or are
[SPEAKER_01]: highly skilled at a specific part of the
industry that are going to be around for
[SPEAKER_01]: the duration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big money is going to eat a lot of this
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the things that we target is
these specialized portions plus going on
[SPEAKER_01]: the exotic and because that has mass
appeal and we're hopefully going to target
[SPEAKER_01]: the mom and pop who want to grow six
plants in the backyard here in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to capture that market as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have several different avenues that
we are exploring besides the seed
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seed industry is really just my own
specific little thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because it's what I enjoy doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy manipulating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to that end, what I'd like to try and
do is do more professional breeding for
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry on request.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know whether you guys know about
BPS or not, but BPS is the Black Platinum
[SPEAKER_01]: Society and is probably the most expensive
seed bank company in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an invite only.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can't just join.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to be invited to join.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it and it's all private.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only thing I can say is,
is that probably some of the largest names
[SPEAKER_01]: in the industry are members.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got that to deal with in this as
well as all the specialized breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the other things that we're into and
going into are also pretty interesting as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can keep going and going and going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you better stop me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, if we just jump back to a
little reference you made a second ago
[SPEAKER_00]: about how exotics in general are on the
rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what's really interesting is that
the majority of your work would widely be
[SPEAKER_00]: considered really exotic, really tropical,
that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's just a matter of time
before the masses really pick up on your
[SPEAKER_00]: strains and run with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you referenced, it is the
current hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's, I'm hoping to actually get
ahead of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to work to get ahead of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we target in is I like to target the
very high end of the scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to look at liquor,
I'd like to be the high end liquor person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be that Rolex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always strived to be that way
because it's important to me to be there
[SPEAKER_01]: for the customer and give the customer the
ultimate that I can give them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because like I said, I'm so picky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been a real curse, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really allows me to be able to focus
in really tightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that couple of that, with the
microbreeding that I do, it allows me to
[SPEAKER_01]: move in advance on these things really
fast in relation to other people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing different styles of breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm hoping to get ahead of all of
this because our company plans involve
[SPEAKER_01]: really getting into where this industry is
going, at least in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I envision within the next few years,
you're just going to see large scale
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that is going to wipe out the
mom and pop specialty little stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: people adore so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to see that happen to my
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as a result, that's where we want
to try and partner with large scale
[SPEAKER_01]: producers and keep the brand on the high
end for people to be able to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spoken to a few different breeders
about this exact subject you're tapping
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess one of the sentiments I've
heard expressed from a few different
[SPEAKER_00]: people is that there's always going to be
a demand for the ultra high end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the presumption is that a lot of these
big corporations are probably not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be putting out the absolute best of the
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that in mind, do you feel like a
black market environment for that will
[SPEAKER_00]: always be kind of inevitable and there may
be a spot for these people who look as
[SPEAKER_00]: though they might be wiped out if they
were willing to go black market type
[SPEAKER_00]: thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always going to be that component.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's still a component in
California for moonshine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people that still make moonshine
in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even to this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no reason to think that this is
going to quell it to the full extent that
[SPEAKER_01]: they want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I do feel is that our industry
has the ability at this early point to
[SPEAKER_01]: manipulate it to the point proper
perspectives and keep everything in line
[SPEAKER_01]: with the way that we want the industry to
evolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's just incumbent upon
individual producers to show up to their
[SPEAKER_01]: best game, make sure the customer is taken
care of, make sure that everybody plays by
[SPEAKER_01]: the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think that it's because you're
only going to be able to manipulate it so
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: The government's going to do what it's
going to do and the state's going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: what it's going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to be light on your feet and
be right on your feet when you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you're going to have a component.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are going to have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, overall, you can still have
this wonderful legal exotic at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's done right and done fair and done
beneficially to the society.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we're going.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would be your advice in terms of
how, as a community, we can get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of goal that you're describing,
whereby, you know, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: self-regulation and the mom and pops
haven't been forced out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be your plan for us to get
there ideally?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that the people need to
speak up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to make that call.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call to their representatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to make sure that their voices
are heard as far as that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to see people edged out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think that you're looking at huge
money and you're looking at people with
[SPEAKER_01]: deep pockets who don't give a damn about
the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: All they see is the green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those people have a way of edging into
this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am very, very cautious of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the way around that has been
shown just in the political climate that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're seeing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're seeing a resistance to that kind of
thinking, that kind of controlling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that just needs to
transpose on over into this industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to keep our voice heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to keep them understanding that
you're talking about monumental shifts in
[SPEAKER_01]: local economies in some areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what the economy is based on around
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to disrupt it to the point that
they're talking about disrupting it is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be a detrimental thing for a lot
of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be very scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that needs to be worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That needs to be taken care of and
considered when they're doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the local municipalities and stuff,
they have to come together on all this and
[SPEAKER_01]: find a way to work with these people and
the subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's just how it has to work
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting there, it all depends on how
organized the voices are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, and I've railed on this for
years, don't come off like stupid stoners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't portray yourself in the hippie garb
of the old days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come off intelligent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't be the one with a bong in your
hand when people are interviewing you on
[SPEAKER_01]: television for a particular issue or
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to project a new image.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it needs to be one that society is
going to accept.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to have really long hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, it got beaten into me that,
you know what, people judge you by what
[SPEAKER_01]: they see.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't judge you by your character.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I finally ended up cutting my hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what pop smokers need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to cut their hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good metaphor.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it is really true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, just with that word of wisdom
in mind, if we could just jump back to a
[SPEAKER_00]: different topic we spoke about,
I just want to touch back in on something
[SPEAKER_00]: you mentioned a fair bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were talking about how you harvest
gooey at different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got different medical properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something which I had recently noticed is
the gooey cross C99 crosses that Duke
[SPEAKER_00]: Diamond did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those phenos, particularly one
that a friend of mine has grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: is quite high in CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a bit of a surprise to me
because it doesn't seem apparent that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a ton of CBD in either of those
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or am I wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the gooey CBD rich?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, especially early on.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're looking at, yeah,
yeah, you're looking at a wonderful array
[SPEAKER_01]: of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets kind of racy at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a little racy early on,
but it really hits the pain at that point
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then as it progresses, the couchlock
and the sedative qualities really come
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I noticed that if you let it go a
really long time and then age it or let it
[SPEAKER_01]: age for, you know, six months in a jar or
something like that, yeah, the CBD is
[SPEAKER_01]: really predominant and very nice and very
palatable too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor changes to this rich malt iness
that's quite intriguing and totally
[SPEAKER_01]: different from fresh gooey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fresh gooey is really sweet and tropical.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cured stuff is a lot more complex and
I enjoy it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, no, you've got a lot of really
good stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that what I always recommend
to people when they're growing gooey is
[SPEAKER_01]: just start picking, you know, early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see about an eighth of the hairs
on there, pick it and try it and see what
[SPEAKER_01]: you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as it goes and you get half of
them are gone, you go ahead and try it
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because usually I'm used to describing
this to people maybe who have never grown
[SPEAKER_01]: the pot before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the pistols as a gauge for them so
that they don't have to think too hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I usually use a loop or a
microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think something which is interesting,
which you just said, there is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just start picking the buds off
at different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to do that, you'd have to be an
organic grower, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, all you're doing is
gauging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, it's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, of course you can make it
better, but you're not looking for that
[SPEAKER_01]: right then.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I'm a very purposeful person and
everything that I do as far as what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get done, I'm looking for an
exact thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that point, I'm looking at what the
effect is because it's a little harsh or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever is not the focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I expect that you can move on,
you know, focus on what you need to focus
[SPEAKER_01]: on and not try to judge the thing at that
point, because you can go ahead and flush
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, I would think that you
would already start to be flushing it at
[SPEAKER_01]: that point anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, only because, you know,
six and a half weeks, you're almost there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of nutrient regime do you use?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I grow every way you can think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm very stingy because what I try to
do is develop strains to not need a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you put even mom gooey,
if you try to give her too much,
[SPEAKER_01]: she'll reject it and be really pissed and
you'll be very upset.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I always target to try and
have strains use as little as possible
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm thinking of the customer
nutrients are expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try and make them go as long as you
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's I always try to breed towards
responsive plants that don't need a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot of gripe for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, people people are so used to,
you know, pumping their plants up and was,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if it's bred properly towards
that, you don't need to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not real good about getting that
info out, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I need to do more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it certainly seems like a good
try to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one would think, but I get I get a
lot of grief for it because I think people
[SPEAKER_01]: just think that it's going to produce
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not necessarily true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, too, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to, you know,
get huge, thick things, you can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you need a huge, thick plant in order
to have it come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get from this little
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen I've seen gooey mom with that 13
feet tall with a top bud larger than your
[SPEAKER_01]: head and with bottom branches as large as
a man's thigh and six feet out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can get huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, people, they expect certain
things and, you know, they go into it with
[SPEAKER_01]: preconceived notions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we try and educate as much
as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes you you're surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think another thing which just popped
into my mind is you mentioned that the tie
[SPEAKER_00]: was the last thing you crossed into the
gooey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that the end result of the
gooey does have a lot to do with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, does the tie account for a lot of
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it doesn't account for a lot of it,
but it accounts for the I think the
[SPEAKER_01]: specific type of high that this plant
gives you.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, all I look at, I look at resin as a
vehicle, and that's why I wanted to build
[SPEAKER_01]: really resin plants with really large
glands, because, of course, the epidermal
[SPEAKER_01]: layer is where the THC is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wanted more of that epidermal
layer on that gland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the bigger the gland, the better
off it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in targeting that, you can go ahead
and then build in whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got this huge vehicle of this
huge these huge glands to work in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I did that and the tie is an
interesting story and it's a fun story.
[SPEAKER_01]: This tie had washed up on the shores of
Northern California in these aluminum
[SPEAKER_01]: canisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was dumped off offshore and got
discovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were able to get some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had this most exotic chocolate tie
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some really amazing sticks that
were with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the best stuff were these flaky kind
of brownish cinnamon, reddish cinnamon tie
[SPEAKER_01]: that had the chocolate flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also had this really bright
strawberry note to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the tie that we used in GUI
on the very last portion of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just really finished the flavor off
and gave it that little psychedelic edge
[SPEAKER_01]: that I love so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that tie was it was just a is one of
those things that you remember all your
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be able to smoke GUI and to be able
to go, oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you just mentioned the big
trichome glands, which is interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of people, you know,
kind of the more knowledgeable sources
[SPEAKER_00]: have traditionally said that your more
equatorial sativus tend to have thinner
[SPEAKER_00]: glands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you find it to be like a bit of an
uphill battle trying to make them thicker
[SPEAKER_00]: or did it come easily?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you see, that's where you see that's
where the Maui came in, because the Maui,
[SPEAKER_01]: I am sure, had Pakistani and I think and
Pakistani glands are huge there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got large glands and and and the tie
had, you know, they were they were almost
[SPEAKER_01]: surface, you know, almost without any
stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but just fairly, fairly noticeable and
very, you know, fairly good size
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves, but not as big as the
components of the Maui added from before
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know, the Cambodian had a nice
dusting, but it wasn't like it was after
[SPEAKER_01]: the Maui component.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really think that that's and it just
carried over.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tie didn't didn't reduce the size.
[SPEAKER_01]: It carried into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use things as a vehicle and you select
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This this plant happened to be the only
one that was like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the resin that it made was a
mutation that it was easily a third again,
[SPEAKER_01]: as resiny as anything else that was in
that at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I selected it and kept it
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's just become such a
favorite that I've just kept it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, you just kind of touched on it
then when you when you did first pop the
[SPEAKER_00]: gooey seeds, how many did you pop to find
the mom?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Knowing in that in that particular
instance, there was a greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we had probably maybe 30 plants of this
going there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was sharing it with another grower and
he had one side of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the other and I was doing tests and
stuff and I had everything in pots so that
[SPEAKER_01]: when it came time to do seedings and
stuff, I could move them out and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, get his stuff seeded because he
was not seeding anything of his.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would I would I can't remember exact
numbers because I don't pay attention to
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just however many females that I was
going for through that at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would guess from vague memory,
about 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so was this before the advent of
indoor lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how did you keep the strain going at
that point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, oh, yeah, no, this was this was at the
very beginning stages of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember one of the buying one of these
really incredibly silly little hydroponic
[SPEAKER_01]: kits, and we would just use that and root
cuttings in that because I had a bubbler
[SPEAKER_01]: in there and it had kind of like I think
kind of like a hydro corn kind of a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't hydro corn because that was much
later, but it had something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the old lava rock, the red lava
rock that people used to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would just root in that and keep
things going that we like, because I
[SPEAKER_01]: learned early on that cuttings were
amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called cutting a slip back in the
day and taking slips was the way that you
[SPEAKER_01]: had to preserve things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned that that from an old lady
who was doing roses and she was taking
[SPEAKER_01]: slips and then rooting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought, well, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I learned how to root with the moss
on while it's on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you wrap it in gauze and moss
with a rooting compound and you can grow
[SPEAKER_01]: roots while the plant's still growing and
then just cut it off and plant it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a fun trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's certainly something I haven't seen
done regularly these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, that and burying the branches,
you know, partway having it serpentine up
[SPEAKER_01]: and down and then you bury the and tie
down the things and it grows roots right
[SPEAKER_01]: there and feeds the branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do it that way too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like doing that on certain types of
sativas because they do grow vine like and
[SPEAKER_01]: that works out really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feeds the plant and makes for a lot
better yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last little part of GUI in terms of
the makeup that we haven't spoke about the
[SPEAKER_00]: backstory, the Cambodia, how did you get
that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: That came from a gentleman who was
stationed over in Vietnam at the time and
[SPEAKER_01]: had brought back seed that he had with he
actually brought back pot, smuggled it in
[SPEAKER_01]: some way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't really looking for it back
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had quite a little bit and he dug
some of this out when I was with a friend
[SPEAKER_01]: of his.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I happened to notice that he was just
throwing the seeds away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, oh, can I have those?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, can you save those seeds that
you get off of that for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I actually gave him 20 bucks and he
saved all the seeds from probably,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, about three or four ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used those to find the ones that I
wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a really spicy, delicious
pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just had a really nice spicy flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss all of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that Cambodians kind of one
of the land races, which doesn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: enough of a good rap, because you don't
see it come up a lot compared to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'll tell you right now,
all of the landers, you can't hardly trust
[SPEAKER_01]: landers anymore anywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: The days of these types of pot are just
basically gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either they've been eradicated,
they've been torn away in drug,
[SPEAKER_01]: not drug, in war torn areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been infiltrated by other types of
strains that have been brought from
[SPEAKER_01]: outside and they've polluted the gene
pools that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a real sad commentary.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, obviously, I'm sure there are
places in the world where there are still
[SPEAKER_01]: pure lines, but they are few and far
between.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure if you talk to Bodhi,
he'd tell you the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He travels a lot and he can see that
there's a trend that is not very good
[SPEAKER_01]: because people are sharing seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you go and you share seed with
somebody just out of a gesture of
[SPEAKER_01]: kindness, you're doing a disservice in
that area towards this end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's just a sad commentary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So landerses anymore are so difficult that
you really need to, when you acquire one,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can perfectly use an example here from
the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Badger, who works for Subcool,
gave me some seed from a gentleman from
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia who said that he was growing
this stuff that this is what the
[SPEAKER_01]: Aborigines grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a fourth generation back cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know anything about it other
than the ones that I've got growing off of
[SPEAKER_01]: it right now are supposed to be landers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they have one of them has an auto
flower under 24 or seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Disturbed about that, as far as that goes,
it's and I don't know if you've ever heard
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called reindeer syrup.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, in just using that as a fresh
example, you know, I highly doubt that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's auto flowers like that,
because this is supposed to be a 13 week
[SPEAKER_01]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would expect that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so I am skeptical at best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you choose as an example, you just
don't know, especially it's almost like
[SPEAKER_01]: the game telephone where, you know,
you send a message around the group and it
[SPEAKER_01]: changes by the time it gets to the other
end.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just never know anymore what you're
getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stay within my gene pool that I have now
almost exclusively.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few things and I always list
them and tell people where where and what
[SPEAKER_01]: I have and what I've used.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, I don't use other
people's work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just stay away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting, because I was going to
ask you that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, would you ever consider at all or
it's just not interested?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's not that I'm not interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that I look at it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always said this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to I want the customer to have a
wide range.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want intermixing and stuff like
that to get in the way of the customer
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the customer wants an AK 47 to get
an AK 47, I don't want to give them an AK
[SPEAKER_01]: 47 times mom, because, you know,
that's some of the same genetic that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while it may be fine and or it may be
wonderful, who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I've always just wanted the
customer to have a wider experience and to
[SPEAKER_01]: blend this stuff and muddy it and dilute
it is not the not not something I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: attracted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think that that I think it's
better that if the other breeders do that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's you know, that's what the
young breeders are for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's what who I'm breeding
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's those young people coming up who
want to do a mix like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't want to see people do it by
name, you know, so that they can have a
[SPEAKER_01]: cool name.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's dumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's just dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breed for purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't breed for, you know, stupid stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing, too, and I'm guilty
as anybody is, is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to start, you know, putting
positive connotations to this product and
[SPEAKER_01]: not negative ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No more grain crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm like I said, I'm guilty of
it, you know, the double death stuff and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the dementia's edge goes on and
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but all those things actually
had a purpose for a point, a pointed
[SPEAKER_01]: purpose for medical use, because like
double death was for actually terminate
[SPEAKER_01]: terminal ill people to make it a little
easier on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the dementia was to help sharpen the
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's interesting, because I
actually saw double death pop up and as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as death grip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't find a lot of information about
them except for that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like related to dark desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the makeup of double death and how
come everyone online?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what I found was someone guessing
the lineage online, but it looked wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just hoping to get like a
clarification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, double death is the death grip times
the gooey 96 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing I found said it was like there
was zinc and lava in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that doesn't sound right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they're probably referring to,
let's see, what would that be?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I wonder if they're thinking about
dark desire, maybe because dark desire has
[SPEAKER_01]: double death times in times gooey times
the the African, which lava was built from
[SPEAKER_01]: and the gooey 84 percent from what I
remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was it about the gooey 84 percent
male that made you choose to use it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: few different crosses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what stood out about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss that male, you know, of all the
stages and of all the gooey progressions
[SPEAKER_01]: that male just had everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I I get focused on different things at
times and I get I should have kept that
[SPEAKER_01]: male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really miss him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had he basically looked like mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: He basically had that really tight
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a really great
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity to pump out pollen and his resin
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could smoke a bowl of him and you just
get so stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was he was a real good, a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I and I think this is what
made me get away from him was he seemed to
[SPEAKER_01]: pass on a greater penchance for powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was trying to breathe away from
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the good part about this is,
is that the seeds that I got today,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the 72 percent and they will go to
mom and then that will build that 84
[SPEAKER_01]: percent again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have a chance to be able to find
a male that's somewhat like that in that
[SPEAKER_01]: because he had a lot of body to the to the
to the high that I liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't all head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had I like a balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a little bit of each.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he had that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're going to target for
in this next round.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring those back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with a lot of of hope and a little bit
of luck, we're not going to get away from
[SPEAKER_01]: producing those seeds on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those will be a fixed entity when I find
the right ones, if I find the right ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of touching on the issue of
germinating old seeds, do you have any
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques for doing that and what's the
oldest seeds you've ever germinated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I did germinate a couple
of seeds that were probably 10 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty iffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can try a little Gilbraic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like a two or four percent
solution of Gilbraic acid, because that'll
[SPEAKER_01]: be the component that gets lost in the
age.
[SPEAKER_01]: And soaking them in a solution of that
increases the chances of being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gilbraic acid is responsible for that
explosive growth that comes out of a seed
[SPEAKER_01]: when it first comes out of the shell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it quadruples and more in
size in an amazingly short period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that that component is what's
responsible for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and it's readily available online.
[SPEAKER_01]: No big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing about germinating old
seed, the other thing that I've found that
[SPEAKER_01]: can help is to probably stick them in the
refrigerator for a few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people have even tried maybe putting
them in the freezer like a deep freeze and
[SPEAKER_01]: then bring them out and try and germinate
them there, because that kind of simulates
[SPEAKER_01]: a winter kind of situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some strains respond to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard of that working as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I wanted to ask you was
seeing as you have kind of alluded the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian, the Maui was you know,
some Asian and some Pakistani and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about what would generally
be regarded as Land Race Hawaiian?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that a different thing in your mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no such thing as Land Race
Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no such thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no such thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Land races need to be inbred in
microclimated areas for generations upon
[SPEAKER_01]: generations in order to be real land
races.
[SPEAKER_01]: Land races don't exist in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is imported.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that you see in Hawaii from
pineapples to trees to everything in
[SPEAKER_01]: Hawaii is imported.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are no such there is no such
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there are long standing strains that
you can find in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even a lot of those have disappeared
over the years due to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just the raids and and, you know,
growers dying off and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, there are no such things as Land
Race Hawaiians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another quick little pop question I
wanted to ask was the GUI has got to be
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the oldest clones I've ever heard
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the oldest clone you know of?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to muse on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been so there's been, you know,
there's been so much over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's get back to that one here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, too easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Zin is another one to me, which has got
an extremely interesting makeup,
[SPEAKER_00]: most because it's such a wide eclectic
pool of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why was there so many kind of different
parents?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, did you just kind of keep working
until you felt it was finished?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, Zin, you know,
it really all started with I was pissed
[SPEAKER_01]: off at Soma as far as the Rockbud,
the way that it was so inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just needed to work on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hit it with GUI with with with a male
GUI back then, it probably would have been
[SPEAKER_01]: a 50-50.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was probably the first attempt at
starting in on on the GUI cubing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back then, that was that would have
been it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hit the only halfway decent Rockbud
from Soma that I could find in like two
[SPEAKER_01]: packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time, I also had sub had sent
me some seeds that he was getting ready to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell the the Sputnik 1.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: I subcooled and I basically started Breed
Bay a long, long, long time ago with
[SPEAKER_01]: pistols and and Doc Bob.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were among the very, very first
people to sign up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have a long relation,
even though we have radically different
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had tried some of that and there
was one Fino in there that, oddly enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't express any color, but was a nice
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I hit a male from that group that I
thought was pretty close to the female
[SPEAKER_01]: that I liked and hit a GUI mom with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really kind of seemed to to be a
nice segue into the into the Rockbud,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, because the Rockbud was able to
stay pronounced and pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went ahead and I used something
that was given to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called a very, very surprise and
very, very surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a male from that I used on GUI as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put that into that mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the whole last component after
that was the eighty four percent male GUI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it and it culminated in this purple
bud that really none of the other things
[SPEAKER_01]: that expressed that I had to think it came
from the Sputnik.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it could have been the the very,
very surprised, but I never saw any plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that express color in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but I know that the Sputnik had a had a
a purple component in the genetics and it
[SPEAKER_01]: just came out in that particular Fino.
[SPEAKER_01]: And boy, that was yeah, I got I actually
got rid of Zen and I did away with it
[SPEAKER_01]: because over time, genetically,
it starts to have recessive stuff come out
[SPEAKER_01]: that I don't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them is hermaphrodism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes out about the fourth generation
in certain mixes, you know, in certain it
[SPEAKER_01]: when people are trying to grow and even
even within my strains, if you mix it with
[SPEAKER_01]: certain things like, you know,
Tyburn fairs or something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to it's going to give you a
hermaphrodite city.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awful like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I I aced it out because I don't want
that in the genetic pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people love the earlier stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as they, you know,
you know, are growing those things out and
[SPEAKER_01]: testing their work, they'll be able to
screen that stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we allowed the ones that exist now
to be out there, but that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the very, very surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You briefly touched on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very well documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your speculation as to the
genetics of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew it for two years and it had some a
wide range of phenotypes, but the most
[SPEAKER_01]: desirable ones were pretty much expressed
in kind of a sativa fashion with a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: full bud structure and a very sweet,
nice smell that I enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never saw a color, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think anything that is named Barry
needs to be colored like a berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we just jump over to lava for a
second, why did you make that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: And were you looking to make it purposely
or was it kind of a bit of an accident?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, here's what when the original African,
excuse me, hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And drink a drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lava African is a really it's a really
exotic tasting plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like I love the color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Color was really dark when I saw the small
amount of examples that I saw of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the seed that I got from it when I
grew it, every single thing was purple on
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, even with a really dark
expression to the leaves here in Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were green, but they had this dark
look to them that was different than that,
[SPEAKER_01]: like an indica look to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they flowered, the deep
purple that it had was just awe inspiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it and the high was crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew that going in because I had
tried some of this stuff before.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the high was it was just crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't care because that can be
fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted that component of the color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I mixed that and with an old old
indica that it was just it was just a
[SPEAKER_01]: gorgeous indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was also a Hawaiian part of it
that this gentleman friend of mine that
[SPEAKER_01]: grew this beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the closest thing I would say is
like a kawaii electric kind of a plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: although that wasn't it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just something that he had grown
himself over on the islands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is what I like is, you know,
little stuff that people don't get
[SPEAKER_01]: released and stuff that got added in with
this old indica that used to be illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: when I got ahold of the seed here in
California before they made indica is
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called the cabbage bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looked like cabbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't have a lot of structure to the
bud and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was mostly leaf, but it was just
crusted as all get out with this
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly skunky smelling just really
whoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a fun, fun plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had that for many, many,
many, many, many, many, many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used the a male from the African on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I added the Hawaiian and last on
that and Lava.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to make was actually almost
exclusively for the Hawaiian market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent that back and my my Honolulu rep
had rights over that for a long time and
[SPEAKER_01]: had many islanders grew that because it
purples up no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really was a big hit over there
because they loved it because I had the
[SPEAKER_01]: the photograph, you know, look.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also had this exotic taste that I
kind of look like a Moroccan spice bizarre
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of thing to it that everybody just
really enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I still I still enjoy some of
the types of Lavas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working with some Lavas that I'll
bring out later on that kind of build on
[SPEAKER_01]: that more and bring more of that out to
the foreground.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's even more than Lava did.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that was that was something that
I of course, the THC levels were,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in the middle, but I could build
on that and make it it much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're working on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to bring those those old
favorites back to Goothunder as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really exciting and something to
look forward to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned the purple and how,
you know, it's really pronounced in that
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember reading an article you wrote,
you discussed how you bred the dark desire
[SPEAKER_00]: as an attempt to breed a better purple
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: What to you is a better purple strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just an aesthetic thing or is it
more of like in the medical sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's several components to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the medical sense is first and
foremost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've given a number of my purple lines
to researchers who are back East.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to really expose them or
anything like that because they're they're
[SPEAKER_01]: working kind of, you know, underground,
but they are actual real researchers who
[SPEAKER_01]: are exploring the components of the the
the antioxidant qualities that come from
[SPEAKER_01]: that and what they're what their interplay
is when we're smoking them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an inkling and I've gotten some
vestiges of of of them saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: yes, I think what you're on to is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're excited for that because the
anti-inflammatory things that it brings to
[SPEAKER_01]: the table really, you know, are key when
you're smoking, you know, that's you're
[SPEAKER_01]: causing inflammation to your lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's another key component to
smoking purples that fights that
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation, I think that that's a
incredible plus and needs to be explored
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's exactly what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're excited about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I work towards that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, too, of course, it's
aesthetically there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people look at that and go,
wow, that's pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to try that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my biggest thing in the past has been
that people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke purples and it has this much dusty
flavor of the the purple component itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The actual chemical has a taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's not masked and overridden,
it it's not palatable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not very good at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I have always strived to do is
to build in a much more flavorful
[SPEAKER_01]: component.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that when people start getting
more exposure to stuff like midnight snow
[SPEAKER_01]: and those crosses, right there,
they're going to be overwhelmed with how
[SPEAKER_01]: much purples can taste different than what
they're probably used to or exposed to in
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional purple lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So always excited to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But oh, yeah, I love midnight snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly seems to be one of the newer
ones, which I don't think the public have
[SPEAKER_00]: fully picked up on yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you attribute that to just,
you know, it's just kind of not out there
[SPEAKER_00]: yet, or do you want to kind of push it a
bit more?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, there's more work I want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have purposefully kept this market of
mine very limited for a very simple reason
[SPEAKER_01]: of future marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more that you know, I could release
seeds a number of places.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've seen that they've been an attitude
before and they've been at other seed
[SPEAKER_01]: banks before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now they're at James Bean Seed
Company, jbc.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's about the only place right now
other than my private reps and the BPS
[SPEAKER_01]: folks that are getting seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's by design because, like I said,
I want to be able to hook myself into the
[SPEAKER_01]: larger production market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of that is creating quite
frankly, a high end product that you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: get ahold of readily.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just keeps, you know,
that status.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean I don't want everybody to
have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that up until now, this is how I
built the product to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just referencing back to the article I
mentioned where you spoke about breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: the doctor's eye for the proper purple,
I think a little later in that article,
[SPEAKER_00]: you said something along the lines of
non-true genetic purples generally occur
[SPEAKER_00]: due to like the cold, maybe a few other
little factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this isn't quite the case with your
ones, which are like the true purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got me thinking, what do you think are
the mechanisms which make that occur?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you mean as far as the other ways
other than being genetically built in?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like traditionally people would argue
that the cold induces purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your lines would argue that that's not
exclusively the only way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of thinking, well,
if it's not the cold, like what does do
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you even referenced something
along the lines of like slower movement of
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as far as the sugars and stuff
moving, that's what happens in the fall
[SPEAKER_01]: and winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I referenced trees like a maple tree or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When those things stop moving through the
plant, then these pigments come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that they're always masked by
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now all of a sudden without the
chlorophyll in the mix, all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: they're visible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just basically what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's with a cold induced thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are moving slower in the plant and
you're not able to express those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a different time of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just their cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same thing with pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some strains don't purple at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never will.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter how cold it gets, they'll just
stay green.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's others that have this penchant for
the sugars moving slower through the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, the chlorophyll doesn't
get moved and they start to die off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, they express these
purples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's my type of purples,
which are genetic mutation that probably
[SPEAKER_01]: was developed in response to high levels
of UV exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just another way of protecting the
plant, much like resin in high altitude
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's speculated that that's why the plant
developed it initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then other theories come into play
like insect deterrents and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: One would argue that the plant kind of
hooked onto human nature long ago and
[SPEAKER_01]: probably built itself around us more than
anything, since we do have receptors in
[SPEAKER_01]: the brain that are just for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just finally, referencing back to that
article one last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not really that one specifically,
but in general, do you plan to do more
[SPEAKER_00]: articles going forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it feels like they're quite
informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: The community seems to engage quite well
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I am trying to do right now is I'm in
the beginnings of writing a book about my
[SPEAKER_01]: particular method of breeding because I
think it's a good time to bring this out,
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep people on the straight and narrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only problem is mine's a numbers game
and it really is truly a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's ways to manipulate that that I
would like to share with people so that
[SPEAKER_01]: they can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately this can be used in an
industrial setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, I really haven't even
been approached.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other folks that are skilled with
photographers, you know, skills and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that have presented my work very
eloquently in magazines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's about the extent of the
exposure that that's gotten.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, God bless them and that's
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course I would do more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really, really hoping that I can
advance this brand here with the laws
[SPEAKER_01]: changing the way they have in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made this much more complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'm hoping that will come about
is that I can partner with some
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals who've got facilities and we
can move the brand forward at that rate a
[SPEAKER_01]: little faster than what I can do on my own
with just my company alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's an interesting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess maybe an interesting question
then would be for someone who's just
[SPEAKER_00]: starting out, what would be your advice to
kind of the aspiring breeders like without
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily giving into what you
referenced earlier where you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: making a whole bunch of, you know,
F1 hybrids with not a lot of intended
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, see, that's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want people to not do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want people to start focusing in on
targets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them to pick a target.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them to understand their parent
plants before they do any breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should know that plant inside and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means growing it more than once.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means growing it in more than one
fashion and in one situation and putting
[SPEAKER_01]: it through stresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that we do has goes through a
lot of different steps before it ever hits
[SPEAKER_01]: the market, because you need to know these
answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be able to tell people what's
going on and you need to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the pitfalls that then you can
give them to be able to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't have a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I grow is based and the
way that I describe everything that I
[SPEAKER_01]: describe is based on a one gallon pot with
potting soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a little cow crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you get a base standard,
because I always gear myself and my
[SPEAKER_01]: instructions for the beginning grower
who's never had a seed in the ground
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything that everybody sees is kind
of based off of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I get what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess, how do you feel about breeders
who put out seeds without testing them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much that in itself, but more so
when people get asked about that these
[SPEAKER_00]: days, they'll say, yeah, but the market
just moves so fast these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not enough time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my life, that's not proper
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can call yourself a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can throw pollen around, sell seed,
and a clock is always right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Twice a day, even if it's broken,
it's right twice a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't give people a license to
be called a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: A breeder is someone who picks a goal,
designs to that goal, meets that goal,
[SPEAKER_01]: tests that goal to ensure that subsequent
breeding with that is OK and doesn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: a little built in time bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you release it to the public
because it also it really also depends
[SPEAKER_01]: upon the market that you're going for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I that's my mindset because I'm
breeding for breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not most of the people that buy my
work aren't mom and pops growing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're people with a purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing it for a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either it's for production or it's for
further breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in my mindset, it has to be the way
that I just said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you're just a, you know,
providing seed for folks and stuff and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not trying to sell them pie in the
sky websites with all these beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures and oh, my God, and then you grow
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't look anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then then no, I'm against that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're always going to have the bad
apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: You I just think that it's better to be an
example that people want to go by than to
[SPEAKER_01]: be an example of somebody that ripped
somebody off and you're scorned and and
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's a short lived life right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What good is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You say you make a couple of bucks doesn't
last.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just not the way we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess on the opposite end of the
spectrum, who are some of the breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: who's working you know, you're really fond
of and I guess you would be willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend to other people if they wanted
stuff outside of your lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, of course, Norstar genetics,
I really am proud of because, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: they use my work in some of their stuff,
but they also have their own distinct
[SPEAKER_01]: ideas and they breed much the same way as
I do very, very, very well tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I enjoy their attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Bodie's attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to really admit I don't grow a lot
of other people's stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stuff that I do tend to grow more than
anything is these little nobody's ever
[SPEAKER_01]: heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody will ever hear kind of people that
have got something that they've
[SPEAKER_01]: demonstrated to me is interesting this
that I want to follow through and see.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can either replicate or if it was
just a fluky thing or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are the kind of things that usually
get my outside attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I have years of backlog
seed that still need to be tested,
[SPEAKER_01]: gone through and cataloged and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I really don't have time for to
enjoy other people's work the way that I
[SPEAKER_01]: should.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the stuff that I have tried from other
folks, I get a little frustrated with how
[SPEAKER_01]: much it tastes the same as other people's.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not a lot of distinction to a
lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every now and then I'll try something from
somebody that has a lot of distinction to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I feel good about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another choice for the customer to
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really, you know, I've got to
confess that I don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: exposure with other people's work these
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got so frustrated with it back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't see a lot of testing with
people doing that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started to harp on breeders all the
time and calling them to the carpet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's people that are no longer
around because people like me,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, voice in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're about, hey, look, you need to know
your shit before your shit gets out there
[SPEAKER_01]: because people are spending real money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're, you know, they're they're
spending a lot of months hoping that this
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to work out for them only to be
disappointed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just that's how I look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always tell young breeders,
get a target.
Don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not know what you're doing as far as what
you're breeding with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know it inside and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then be honest with the people and be
helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be be be giving more than anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be giving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't don't depend upon every little sale
of 10 pack of seed that that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your responsibility ends as soon
as the customer has it in their hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gary, I'm through.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they're grinning with the whole
beautiful plant standing before them that
[SPEAKER_01]: they just can't wait to dry and smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then then you can smile and say,
OK, I did a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when they after they dry it and
they smoke it, they go, oh, my gosh,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's that's the real the real gift from
God.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's the best thing you can have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to that more than
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you feel like in general,
maybe the onus on breeders to take that
[SPEAKER_00]: customer service to the next level?
[SPEAKER_00]: Needs to kind of increase to match the
times we're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this day and age, especially what's
going to set you apart from Joe Blow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, now all the days all he needs this
fancy website, you know, you can post a
[SPEAKER_01]: gazillion pictures just stole all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and you just got to know be be that
person that they want to call on for their
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just just work towards that end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to happen overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeding is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's taken me my whole life.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get this far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's still a lot I want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's no easy road.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a road that can be done and if it's
done properly, you can enjoy success.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't do it properly,
in this day and age, it's not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Internet never forgets the Internet
always will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Internet has the last say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have it say something good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't have it say something bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, just to kind of change topics
for a second, I remember reading one of
[SPEAKER_00]: your descriptions and it read something
along the lines of if it has the word
[SPEAKER_00]: gooey in it, it better be gooey.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like what what what embodies
gooey overall sticky?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the residence got to just be
proliferous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's that's that's the trait
that she's best known for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's you know, if it says it,
it needs to be it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like like I was saying about,
you know, a berry needs to really kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: be purple, I think, or damn near because
it should be like a berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Build stuff that's going to be like it
says.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if it's one of the examples
I use is the old Mendo Hayes, because that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff has this absolutely overpoweringly
wonderful lime vodka taste that people it
[SPEAKER_01]: just it whips their head around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what you want to do as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to bring out that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that was one plant that I found in a
group of seed that was given to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And none of the other plants were like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what you have to do is you have
to find that particular amazingly
[SPEAKER_01]: different plant and bring it forward and
then use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Midnight Snow is beautifully purple,
but it tastes like old Mendo Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: People love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the topic of Hayes, did you ever get
to sample the original stuff and how
[SPEAKER_00]: different is the Mendo Hayes from the
original?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the old Mendo Hayes is from that
original work, because those seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: originally came from Santa Cruz and then
they were grown for, I think, probably
[SPEAKER_01]: over 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up in Mendocino by one guy who said he
never released them.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just interbred back and forth,
but he never claimed that they were the
[SPEAKER_01]: original.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he called it Mendo Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he, you know, he he said they came from
down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And God rest his soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was lucky enough that he gave me a few
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was only because he said,
well, take these and make them famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, I found this one plant
and it's like, oh, yahoo, buckaroo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the Hayes kind of a look to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks I mean, if you looked at a plant
of this, you'd swear to God it was Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the flavor is just so wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't wait to have more people
enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we take a look at one of your other
strains, one that had always caught my eye
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of made me had a bit of a laugh
was the Psycho Patch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually grabbed the pack of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked it so much because it's the AF GUI
and the GUI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that just like a little funny kind of
I wouldn't call it like a pun or like a
[SPEAKER_00]: play on words.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like they both got the GUI
in the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was was it just kind of like a fun thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you really like the AF GUI?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is this is probably going to get
people more right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's been anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately for them, the genetic
DNA has been tested and confirms what I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been telling people for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: My partner made AF GUI and I made GUI and
we both they were both made basically at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same time with a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: 18 months, I think it was spread between
the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the AF GUI got its name because it was
the Afghan one that was crossed into GUI
[SPEAKER_01]: and GUI was first by about 18 months and
it was grown in an indoor situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen people say that it was,
you know, an Indica and Hawaiian and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, that was the component that
people focused on in GUI was the Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been a big debate over this
for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've heard of other people saying
that, you know, that it was this guy in a
[SPEAKER_01]: surfer guy over in Hawaii that originally
developed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I got examples of AF GUI
and they were tested against GUI and it
[SPEAKER_01]: showed a clear genetic relation to the
between the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And which is what I knew already,
because my partner sold AF GUI clones all
[SPEAKER_01]: through the 80s when we made it in the
late 80s when we made it and locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just took off because it was really
a nice plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really a good plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't like it as much as I like GUI.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we agreed that he would go ahead and
take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually even out of deference to
him for many a year, I didn't mention it
[SPEAKER_01]: just because I was kind of hoping that he
would come into the scene and be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: start spreading some of his other breeding
that he did that was really wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he never has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's actually local and kind of lost
touch with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss him.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's confirmed that those two
are related.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought, well, you know, why don't I
just go ahead and cross it back to each
[SPEAKER_01]: other?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't ever recall ever doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the resulting plants have a you know,
they have a squat structure of about five
[SPEAKER_01]: feet, six feet tall maximum.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're really wide and they are just
some of them are just really deliciously
[SPEAKER_01]: tropical smelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really, really enjoy that part of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But overall, it's not my favorite smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what traits are you looking for in
males?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking for GUI traits in like
most of the males or is it different for
[SPEAKER_00]: each?
[SPEAKER_01]: I look for the target trait that I'm using
for that for the target of the breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, everything is specific to what the
target is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want the males to have dominant
traits that also, you know, are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have when they're recessive, they're going
to stay recessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to get passed on and
expressed in that next set.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look for males that perform that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do I do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already tested them with other stuff
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use them for the particular project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already know how they're going to pass
on their traits in different scenarios.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'll use strains that have some
of the same genetics as the targeted one
[SPEAKER_01]: so that I can go ahead and I can see how
the interplay is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once I am happy with that,
then I go ahead and use that male for the
[SPEAKER_01]: targeted purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I go through those plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: A kind of a common idea expressed by a few
different breeders is that they'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: one particular mother for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might be the obvious one, maybe the mum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they'll use a lot of their males on
that because they know predictably how the
[SPEAKER_00]: mum breeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something you do or do wide
variety of pollination?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of that's one of the things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends again on on the breeding goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're breeding for a wide spectrum of
expression, you're going to want to use
[SPEAKER_01]: more than one male.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want to use multiple males
on targeted plants because you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a wider expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would also be if you do pure landers
that you want to maintain, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: want to use more than one male on more
than one female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, mind's a numbers thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And bigger is better in this game.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as numbers go, you want to have as
many as you can grow and maintain as you
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you want to be ultra picky about
what it is you select.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the male, you have to stick with that
target.
[SPEAKER_01]: People get distracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get to where they you know,
they see this and they go, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it fit your target?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if it's interesting,
put it aside.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's another thing that that you want
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's on its own thing off to the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not what your target is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stick with your target.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what dictates what the males
are all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: If if I'm trying to breed out a recessive
hermaphrodism or something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to test the males to make sure
that that's what happens, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm not breeding that in or or or
what genetics triggers it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all this stuff takes time and it takes
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the beauty about this company
that I've made is that I do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the breeding method, the microbreeding
that I do allows me to be able to do this
[SPEAKER_01]: on a scale that allows me the luxury of
the numbers without having to get all
[SPEAKER_01]: carried away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to explain that in the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's going to be a very
valuable thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will touch on all of these types of
of things that people are wondering and
[SPEAKER_01]: how to avoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's just the next step and
the next progression towards making this a
[SPEAKER_01]: better industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just referenced the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: When when would such a thing ideally be
finished?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping within the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I really want to add a lot of
examples and color to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already got a lot of them,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really want to show there's a couple
of instances that I haven't got pictures
[SPEAKER_01]: of that I want to show people progressions
and what I'm talking about and what what
[SPEAKER_01]: it entails and why it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and and it's just a refining thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm probably going to release it as an
e-book so that people can just download
[SPEAKER_01]: it, you know, and get it right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know if it'll be a physical
book.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to me that people don't do that
much anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as traditional books, plus,
you know, killing trees, yada yada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather make it a little I think makes it
easier for people to have and carry
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do all that stuff myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it takes a little time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just referenced, you know,
dealing with hermaphrodism is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever found a line where it had
just outright hermy issues, but you were
[SPEAKER_00]: so into it, you were like, I'm going to
breed this out over a few generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I started, too, with a line
called Zenful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just started to get obsessed with
doing this because Zenful had has it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has beautiful dark presence,
beautiful colors, beautiful berry,
[SPEAKER_01]: deep berry smells, a nice heavy,
heavy yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't take much nutrient to grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really forgiving in a lot of
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: But every now and then it expresses
hermaphrodism on some of the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be sporadic nanners here and
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's just I just can't do that,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I found is, is that if you let
that stuff go, then it tends to get more
[SPEAKER_01]: and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I attribute it to the tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tie traditionally had that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I bred away from it within the tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was growing that tie, the pure tie
was just wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some examples of it did hermaphrodite
is really easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a couple of them didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those were the ones that I was able to
to use like in making gooey.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can you can get away from it,
but it's lurking there always.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all it takes is that trigger gene to
be able to bring a recessive into a
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what testing is all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're like I said, there is no
shortcuts if you're doing it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only shortcuts if you don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you feel about filial breeding
versus, say, back crossing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've noticed you do do filial
breeding, but there's not a lot of back
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing as far as I can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, it depends on whether I want
to cube the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: If if I'm cubing the line, you always go
back to the target plant and you go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, it's just selective
males from for targeted traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really try to stay with one trait only.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I really want to target just one
trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been times where I'll say,
well, this has both.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, we'll set it aside and do further
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully that's the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has worked out sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, you know,
when I'm doing lines like pure gooey,
[SPEAKER_01]: every every succession goes back to mom
because I want that's the target plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just that simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you've got this beautiful plant
and you want to make seed of that plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: the best thing to do is to find another
opposite type of plant or one that has
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the genetics in it that are
exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the rest differs so much like an
indica sativa hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're looking for it to mate it with
another sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're just going to bring away all
all of the indica expressions and just
[SPEAKER_01]: target, target the other plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's you just go through it in
succession until you've got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when you have to be the most
picky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, there is back crossing is is
important, you know, in certain instances.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's the target of your goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I hear more and more in
questions like these and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that that's what's lacking in breeding
in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: To a large extent is people don't think
far enough ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just still stuck in the next very
next seed plant that comes off of the very
[SPEAKER_01]: next seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not going very much further.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not that's in my book.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any circumstances in which you
would opt to use the like a GUI mom you
[SPEAKER_00]: found from the seeds you created out of
the cube project over the mom GUI?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or would you pretty much always opt for
the mom GUI?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be a separate project always,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, I mean, I have in the past
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a there was a it comes to mind a
few years, many years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a version that was a more
resonant mom was the focus of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had there was a mother plant that I
had for a few years that I was using as a
[SPEAKER_01]: as a balancer for mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately, I got rid of it because I
found that it was too dominant in crosses
[SPEAKER_01]: and it would it would just overwhelm
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're a breeder, that's not
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so after a while, I got rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the more resonant mom one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm sure you could probably look
that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably somewhere on Breed Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had it was it was resin on top of
resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I mean, there are certain
instances where, of course, I'll you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all about what you see and whether it
is right or not, whether it's something
[SPEAKER_01]: that is going to be useful and targeted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Targeting is always the thing it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, given the specificity of your
goals and kind of often implied again,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be a separate project.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have you'd have to set it aside
and have a separate thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it would not immediately step in and
be the substitute quarterback in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the quarterback state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So given that a lot of your strains are
using a lot of different steps you've made
[SPEAKER_00]: along the way, have you ever had any
projects where it's just worked on the
[SPEAKER_00]: straight F1 and you've got exactly what
you wanted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those examples, a really good
example at the time would be the Purple
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayhem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Purple Mayhem was exactly what I
wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: First shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was exactly what I expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: First shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I want from it now and with lines
that I'm working from that is I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: add more power into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it needs to have a heavier hit to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people just love the state
where the high is right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get those wonderful flavors that
it has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a blessing right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you ever get to try any of the more
modern strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the current F1 hybrids being
released, have you ever been blown away by
[SPEAKER_00]: any of them or it's all just much the
same?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get high off a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: My tolerance is incredibly high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I complain about this to breeders all
the time that, you know, OK, when's when
[SPEAKER_01]: does it start?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I do find something, what I find more
and more nowadays is bottle rocket bot
[SPEAKER_01]: where you feel this incredible rush and
then it's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ten minutes later, where the hell is the
high?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want something that lasts and has a nice
longevity to it with a steady feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want a lot of peaks and valleys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of previous guests have referenced
that the closer you get to Land Race,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not Land Race itself, generally you get
a high more akin to what you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, very unique, no ceiling,
just long legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think it is about hybridizing
strains, which has caused us to lose,
[SPEAKER_00]: like to almost put a ceiling in place as
to how good the high can be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that that's almost like art,
you know, where beauty is in the eye of
[SPEAKER_01]: the beholder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear I hear all kinds of different
references to older pot given by people
[SPEAKER_01]: who have the knowledge of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with younger people, they have no way
of expressing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Insofar as because the knowledge just
isn't there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find that maybe life experience has
more to it than then they give it credit,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, as far as this goes in so far as
this particular question goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think the more references
you've got, the more you're able to draw
[SPEAKER_01]: off that and can conclude better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just I just like the old the old
feels I think have a better presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why people like for like GUI,
for instance, they really find it to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: unique thing these days when it it it
isn't unique to me at all, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's what I expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of like one of those
signposts in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I'd like to get it out
there more is to have people understand
[SPEAKER_01]: the way it used to be and how it was back
in the day when it was really unique to
[SPEAKER_01]: have all these different strains that
don't taste like the next strain that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that you did today.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just too much too close.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just all too close.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is the this kind of topic we've
referenced in the past on the show where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, although there is this this idea
you're putting forth, it comes up all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time and everyone agrees with it for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a few strains where people
kind of say they are kind of undeniably
[SPEAKER_00]: elite, you know, some of the cushers,
some of the cams and all that type of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about those ones,
which the public still hold as some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: best?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they just same same category?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still not interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, no, I mean, of course,
there's been there's been a few really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting ones that really catch your
eye, like a nice East Coast sour diesel
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really gassy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's really neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The the the different the
[SPEAKER_01]: different sativas that that I find more
more palatable flavors and more
[SPEAKER_01]: uniqueness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really just don't find as much
pleasure in the cushions and and and the
[SPEAKER_01]: the the OG every things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't I just don't get it as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all tastes generic whenever it starts
to taste like a pot shop smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know I'm just not into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I put a lot of that stuff
that's out there now is I even though
[SPEAKER_01]: there are these elites and stuff,
they are they are what attract me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, fair point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just, I guess, to kind of maybe answer
some of the curiosities some people might
[SPEAKER_00]: have, although Indica's aren't your
favorite, which one has left the best
[SPEAKER_00]: impression on you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, of course, the old the old Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like like Afghan one and the old
cabbage Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: If if anybody I know, there are certain
people that are nodding their heads when
[SPEAKER_01]: they're listening to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They remember that old 70s Indica before
it was illegal that had this absolutely it
[SPEAKER_01]: was a skunky taste, but yet it was sweet
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those types of the high was just deep and
soul reaching almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was quite something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the kind of things that I
gravitate to engage my Indica off of our
[SPEAKER_01]: things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the old Pakistani, those were
incredible, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those really had body to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had presence and they grew wonderful
plants that just they were just a pleasure
[SPEAKER_01]: to view.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some would have a pH issues that would
allow the pistols to turn this bright
[SPEAKER_01]: magenta colored and they were just
gorgeous to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just really something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the things that I remember and
engage all the work today on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just don't see a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just see a lot of hybridization,
different expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm guilty of it just like everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm I'm the stuff I'm making isn't like
the old stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's progression.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you referenced the cabbage bud was
quite skunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just on that topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to throw it by everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get to try what people kind of
call the roadkill skunk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it that has a different kind of a
smell to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot has a lot more of the gassy
qualities mixed in with that heavy Indica
[SPEAKER_01]: smell and presence of the dead skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really made it pronounced a lot
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I was speaking to earlier,
where people can make strains that make a
[SPEAKER_01]: completely different smell more pronounced
just by by adding a louder voice to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the vehicle that that shares and
gets expressed from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's that's a good example of
that right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very, very strong, very smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: The highs was pretty much a body high as
far as I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tried some of that up in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a lot of friends up in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to a bit of a random
question, but one I was kind of personally
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in getting answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed a few people I've seen
posting photos of what they have is the
[SPEAKER_00]: mom gooey, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say things along the line like
they got it from you, maybe one step
[SPEAKER_00]: removed from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, are you do you give cuts out pretty
freely or you kind of keep it quite close
[SPEAKER_00]: to chest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, I've always given it away as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I mean, a lot of these
people, I had no reason to doubt them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I was kind of like, yeah, it seems
like he's definitely happy with it being
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you have to understand the method
that I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the more people that understand the
breeding and stuff, I'm hoping that maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: they will be attracted to other stuff that
I've done and maybe they'll want to try
[SPEAKER_01]: other things that I've developed if they
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only that, gooey is probably one
of those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say I wanted to file a patent on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a plant has been out in the public for
more than a year, then it's considered
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much open source.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can't patent a thing like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a signature plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that people really need a
gooey plant in their garden because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the more enjoyable plants that they
will ever, ever own in their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am testament to that it being 35
years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this plant is is a keeper and
there's reason for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they try it, they want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and that was one of the main
motivations of creating the pure gooey
[SPEAKER_01]: seed was the fact that people I couldn't I
can't give enough of a gooey away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't got the capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, if I made a seed that
mimicked mom as much as possible,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can that I can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get it out to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was the motivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always is the motivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The motivation to everything I do,
you know, is that this is the best way I
[SPEAKER_01]: can do it and help people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I don't charge whatever the
reps are charging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't keep up on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever they're making is fine with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever they can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: But believe me, I don't charge a lot to
them because I want them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try and encourage them to keep the price
low, to keep it affordable, because I want
[SPEAKER_01]: people to have this absolute deal where
they they they buy this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many times in this industry,
they'll buy something from a picture that
[SPEAKER_01]: looks so wonderful online and they get it
and it's not what they wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them to be surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them to be, wow, you know,
I got my money's worth out of this and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: so happy that I spent this money.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in giving gooey away, it just shows
people that the real intent of Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: Exotics is not money as much as it is
their satisfaction and their happiness,
[SPEAKER_01]: because life's short.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's let's make it the best it can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good motto.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wanted to run the idea by Femmes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will we ever see some mom gooey S1s?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a time where I did produce that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the genetics on the S1 side are gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't keep them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And did you find the results just weren't
particularly good anyway, or would you
[SPEAKER_00]: consider doing it again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I found that mom
completely overwhelmed it, just completely
[SPEAKER_01]: overwhelmed it almost 90 to 90 percent of
the time with very few of the really super
[SPEAKER_01]: desirable components coming through from
the from the S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the reason that it well,
I know the reason why it is and the reason
[SPEAKER_01]: why it is because gooey is composed of
mostly lander's works by and large.
[SPEAKER_01]: So their genetic chains are very dominant
and people have to be wary of that when
[SPEAKER_01]: they're using it, that that's where it's
going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as genetics go, genetics are like
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take the easiest path.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if people know their shit,
then they're going to be able to know
[SPEAKER_01]: where that path is going to go before they
even breed with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll have a good reasonable expectation
of what to expect if they know their stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: inside now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And landers is when you're when you're
working on old landers is like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to know that those are going to
be dominant in, especially in heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrids like today, where there's
hybridization upon hybridization.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, all this stuff is related and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more truer dominant lines from landers
are going to overwhelm that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the topic of land races,
Durban poison one, Durban poison is one
[SPEAKER_00]: which I find is always kind of
peripherally present on the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are always kind of talking about
it, maybe never in the limelight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing which I wanted to ask you
is, have you ever tried it and how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think it compares to the African ones
you've been experienced with?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, I had exposure to some of
the older like red Africans and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that that were back in the day back when I
lived in England.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was I can't remember what exactly
where but which region it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was just really, really,
really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Durban's are a lot better
structured.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a lot more like they've been bred
for production and for producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather than the stuff that I have been
exposed to, which is gathered,
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly gathered wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a producer friend who does a lot of
generic photographing for Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he has been able to get me a lot of
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was one of the ones that got me
that purple African where they called it
[SPEAKER_01]: weak heads because it wasn't very strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the kinds of Africans that I've
been exposed to back in the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: the African black.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did try a couple of times and that was
stunning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Durban poison, I find to be a
little bit more commercialized,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess is the best word for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a nice high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't seem to last that long for me,
but I'm a hard nugget to please.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately, I would never
incorporate it in anything I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just kind of jumping out of the land
race for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Berry mania.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interesting one because it
incorporates the TGA line lemon freeze,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a rather obscure one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hasn't been around for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it about the lemon freeze which
attracted you to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it pops up in a few places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon freeze wasn't Subcool's work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a subordinate of his that made
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he didn't really care for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I found about it was that it was
a good vehicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had the ability to pass on its
structure along with some of its lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor, but you could easily overwhelm it
with other traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, let's say frozen lava was a good
choice for that because it allowed me to
[SPEAKER_01]: build this deep purple with a crusty,
beautiful dusting of heavy resin and still
[SPEAKER_01]: bring that lava forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it didn't overwhelm it with the
typical lemon turbines that is so typical
[SPEAKER_01]: of Subcool's work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I found it to be a better use than
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Sub as far as a person goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a wonderful guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy him as a person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never really found much of his work that
I could get behind as far as that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this wasn't made by him.
[SPEAKER_01]: The selection wasn't done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's one of his most asked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, Sonny was the one who made
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's interesting because I
think the common sentiment is that a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the more memorable lines from TGA did
come from Sonny's work and the whole TGA
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never really wanted to step on Sub like
that because I've known him for so long
[SPEAKER_01]: and I do appreciate what he's built.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Sonny really was a very, very key
component.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I liked that particular thing probably
more than anything else that I ever tried
[SPEAKER_01]: from TGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I wanted to ask, I've seen a
lot of kind of support from you for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: specific forums over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you noticeably not present on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel there's a big difference
between the platform and how come you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not so present on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I had Pistols from Breedbase set me
up an account on Instagram and I do have
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in all honesty, I'm an older person
and social media to me is its own thing
[SPEAKER_01]: and its own time consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got shit to do and I just don't
have time to I leave that up to other
[SPEAKER_01]: people and they're busy too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Instagram to me, I should I know I
should be on it more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know if you look up GUI reader on
Instagram, there's a shitload of beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures of stuff that people have grown
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've only just recently started to
comment on some of that stuff and to
[SPEAKER_01]: address maybe an issue or two that I saw
on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I just don't spend a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a very private person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a Facebook account.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have very much at all out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess it would benefit me and
maybe I should do that more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll probably end up just hiring
people to do that PR work for me instead
[SPEAKER_01]: and give them the information to post or
whatever, because I just don't have time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, understandable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just more that the work is
more important than than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't I can't do anybody any good if I'm
sitting online posting pictures and being
[SPEAKER_01]: self gratifying.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what that's not what this
company is about.
[SPEAKER_01]: This company is about the customer and I'm
not doing them any good by sitting there
[SPEAKER_01]: posting crap online.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what other people can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they do it quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do it much better than I could ever
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, hey, go with your
strengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't claim to be, you know,
good at very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do try to be the best of what my
capabilities can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: In what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, let those people go with
their own strengths.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there seems to always be a bit of a
call that demand is always exceeding the
[SPEAKER_00]: supply for your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you tend to do that on purpose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, do you limit your seed releases or
is it just simply, you know, all you can
[SPEAKER_00]: do for the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, I mean, I can produce much more,
but most of most of the reasons that I
[SPEAKER_01]: keep the seed restricted is because I'm
the bigger picture of what my company is
[SPEAKER_01]: all about is development for the mass
market when it comes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the seed business is an ancillary
offshoot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one generates the necessary buzz to
keep the product in demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is also I do want I do want to
share this with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I'm getting to a point
now where I'm trying to do both,
[SPEAKER_01]: where I do want to expand enough to give
people the ability to be able to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: hold of the work if they want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also want to have and capture those
very, very specific phenotypes that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the primary reason why I'm making all
the seed is for myself, for that
[SPEAKER_01]: particular goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, I mean, along the way,
other people should be able to share it
[SPEAKER_01]: and enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I find really good plants,
I'll give them away, just like I always
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're interested enough in it and
they want it and they need it for a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular reason or they just want it
because they've seen it and they fell in
[SPEAKER_01]: love with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's reason enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's give it to them, you know,
because it doesn't change my work.
[SPEAKER_01]: My work is is there's always going to be
somebody wanting something from me in some
[SPEAKER_01]: way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just hope I can give it to them and be
it one way or another, whether it be
[SPEAKER_01]: providing seed to the public or providing
that one little plant for that person who
[SPEAKER_01]: really needs it because maybe they're
bedridden and they, you know, they need it
[SPEAKER_01]: for pain or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what God put me here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what a kind of great message
to abide by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are some of breeders from years gone
by who are no longer putting out stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, you really wish they were
still around or you had some of their
[SPEAKER_00]: stock?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I would probably say just for
the experiences that I've had,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would, I kind of maybe would say if I
had to choose any one person, it'd
[SPEAKER_01]: probably be a reefer man just by virtue of
the spread that he used to offer with some
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly predictable results overall every
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciated his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nice, nice selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, sorry, go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are very few.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've tried the Varney's farm and
all the ones that were big names over in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what pissed me off enough to
start really getting serious about getting
[SPEAKER_01]: this work out was just the lack of caring
and the lack of consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the lack of, of expression versus
sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what, what was said isn't what I
see and, and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really got soured on growing other
people's stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't a lot of stuff that I grow
from other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it has to, usually it makes its
way to me from people I trust who do grow
[SPEAKER_01]: other people's stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they say, Hey, you know, you need to
look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't grow a lot of other people's
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, well, you have to learn the hard
way, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, every, yeah, everybody has
their own path.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would rather, I've got, like I said,
years of stuff that I still have to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to go through and, and, you know,
it never stops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never ends.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always something else to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always something else to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something else to check.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at a pile of seed right now
that is in a box that I need to go
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just from this last year that the
box is like seven, eight inches deep,
[SPEAKER_01]: two feet wide, and about 32, 33 inches
long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's full.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need, I need a bunch of acreage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got work to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, that's the kind of thing that
I, you know, I, I just, I, I'm too focused
[SPEAKER_01]: in with my own stuff to worry about other
breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, I want the public to have
as wide a variety to choose from as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to mix it up and,
and, and explore a lot of other breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's for the public to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, I'm, I'm just here to serve
the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not serving the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm wasting my time growing other
people's stuff that is ultimately not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to, I'm not going to use because I
just don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That isn't what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, question on the similar lines
as the last one, maybe going to be a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of a hard one because you may not have
thought of this, but which one person has
[SPEAKER_00]: had the most impact on your life in terms
of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Luther Burbank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's the only answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've expressed that off and on
throughout the interview is that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you, you got to look at, at a master
craftsman who has a very fine view of what
[SPEAKER_01]: his goals were and the extent and the
breadth and width of his work is
[SPEAKER_01]: staggering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm working with one plant that
man worked with amazing amounts of plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, he developed things that are just mind
boggling and he did it all in a very short
[SPEAKER_01]: period of time in his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to really respect him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I would say if people,
you know, did a little bit more reading
[SPEAKER_01]: about the basics that he would teach,
they could benefit quite a bit from the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure everyone probably has a
little bit of homework to do now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think they'll be amazed when they
figure out, like I said, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: the potatoes that we know and love,
he's the one who made them, the
[SPEAKER_01]: blackberries, the grow alongside of the,
the, the roads here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern California and beyond,
they're all because of Luther.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it goes right on down the
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll move on to getting towards the
end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've now got some questions from the
fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you saw that post, so hopefully
you haven't gone ahead and seen too many
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first one is where can we expect
to see your work available in 2018?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm working, on trying to do some
refining of releases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, the one thing that I'm hoping to
do is to be able to late summer,
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to release the next stage of the
pure GUI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's being optimistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I, I'm thinking it's doable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as where to get them,
JBJ, c.com is probably going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: carrying a lot of lines of my individual
reps in various places, Hawaii,
[SPEAKER_01]: down in LA and Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those folks will be posting stuff
individually online that people can find.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, what I try to do is, is give everybody
different sets of genetics so that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not offering the same things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they overlap and everybody is able to
benefit that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's just more of a spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the goal for 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along with what I'm hoping to find is
somebody in the Northern California area
[SPEAKER_01]: who's got growable land with a building on
it that we can move into and start
[SPEAKER_01]: developing some stuff under
[SPEAKER_01]: state guided licensing and all completely
legal 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our goal to get that set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're looking forward to hopefully
making that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some leads.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of folks who are ready to
invest in this company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just waiting for those hurdles to
be jumped over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what we're working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once we do that, people can look
forward to a faster release time of
[SPEAKER_01]: materials because the more space I've got,
I've got a lot of space now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of space now, but to get into
a legal situation, we need, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we need another facility that's different
than the ones that we're working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to really benefit
everybody because then I'm going to try
[SPEAKER_01]: and bring the seed prices down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my next goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, people ought to be
able to get a beautiful result.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fantastic for a really reasonable
price.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're looking forward to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a good outcome for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question was someone said that
they heard you pop beans in relation to
[SPEAKER_00]: the phases of the moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's true, what are the benefits?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: In reality, there's very little benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fun little thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I will do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have found that you get a little bit of
acceleration, especially with super moons.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are few and far between.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times they don't fall in the
right times of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have a tendency to just plant at
least a couple of beans during super moons
[SPEAKER_01]: just because it's been a long held belief
that that accelerates things and gets them
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether I have not found that to be really
true insofar as a final outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a fun little thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Groundhog Day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, thinking that the groundhog
coming out of the ground is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: predict what kind of forecast you're going
to get in the next six weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's along the same lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's an old farmer's almanac
kind of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the techniques you use
for keeping such old clones in healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: condition?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you keep healthy mothers and you
just keep clipping them and again,
[SPEAKER_01]: producing the mothers off of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gooey mom that I have now is not the
original very original plant, although it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same exact plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I keep the lights on 24 seven on
mother plants like gooey all the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: plants don't know how to tell time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to them, it's just one long day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it doesn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just keep clones going and make
mothers off of those and then clip those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just keep on going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is the same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you just have to be diligent about
keeping your clones going through all
[SPEAKER_01]: those years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have other plants that are very old,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like like of stock you are using
around the same time type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not quite that old, but no.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, there's some I have a few
Jamaican varieties that are just wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: spearmint gum kind of things that I'm
developing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've always proved to be, you know,
those bright speaker kind of plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the carrier plants and now Dark
Desire is getting older.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's at least seven years old now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just goes so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time just goes by so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ain't that the truth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you noticed any of your older clones
kind of degrade in any regard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some people have said that even
despite best efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am always skeptical of genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it I think it would take a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I use tomatoes as an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's tomato heirloom tomatoes
that are plants that have been growing for
[SPEAKER_01]: over 100 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their fruit is just as tasty and
delicious as it always has been.
[SPEAKER_01]: But genetic drift is really I think what
you're seeing is an expression of micro
[SPEAKER_01]: climates and very small changes in
environment, be it soil conditions,
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient level, pH, all these different
things come into play and can deceive
[SPEAKER_01]: people into thinking that a genetic drift
is happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It for the cosmic forces to come along and
degrade genetics to that point takes a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A long, long, long, long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just don't think people are alive
long enough to really notice that in a
[SPEAKER_01]: given example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use GUI as a perfect example because
it's been around so long that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: people that I have not seen for decades
that when I hand them a joint of this,
[SPEAKER_01]: they look at and they just look at me and
they go, this tastes exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this feels exactly like I remember it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that to me just says,
yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grown in exactly the same way that
you remember it, you know, using the same
[SPEAKER_01]: mediums.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always tell people with GUI,
I like GUI the best grown in rock wool
[SPEAKER_01]: with general hydroponics nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a particular flavor out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only other variable I would say is
that I do like the flavor of a metal
[SPEAKER_01]: halide in that situation better than high
pressure sodium, but I'm growing more
[SPEAKER_01]: towards LEDs as they develop and get
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but a specific heavy blue light that
comes from the metal halide has a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular flavor enhancer in GUI that
brings more of the sharp, sweet flavors
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the next one is we've got someone
here who says they've got an old pack
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled Superstar and they were just
wondering what's in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they said one of the parents might
be old Mendojays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember what's in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember it being a bright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh, I'd have to look at my notes and I
don't have them with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that escapes me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the old mind just isn't clicking
for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got one question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what would be your recommendations
for breeding against recessive auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering traits?
[SPEAKER_01]: Testing, mail, mail selection and testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like any other trait that you're
trying to breed away from or breed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's testing, you know, do it till you're
satisfied.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't, I don't nine times out of
10, any product problem that people have
[SPEAKER_01]: with this stuff can be fixed with just
doing the proper testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means proper testing involves
stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: It involves different situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It involves putting the plant through its
paces.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you get strong plants that are
well developed and can be predictable and
[SPEAKER_01]: can take a punch, you know, is by and,
and, and to me, if it's, if, if you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have, have that genetic in there,
you get rid of it and get rid of the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can use Zen as the example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I got rid of Zen because of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a recessive that I couldn't get rid
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, it would appear not in the first
couple of cross backs or, or even with
[SPEAKER_01]: other stuff, but it would come out in the
fourth generation and it would be really
[SPEAKER_01]: prevalent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's not acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how you deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get it out of the gene pool,
but you can't know that until you test.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you select males, do you like to
leave them all kind of untapped,
[SPEAKER_00]: untrained, and just see the natural
expression?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, everything I do is all natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: What good is, what good is changing the
shape going to tell you what, what good
[SPEAKER_01]: is, is, is allowing a plant to develop in
a different way, other than the way that
[SPEAKER_01]: you bred it to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, that doesn't tell you anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you, how can you speak intelligently
about how big a plant's going to get if
[SPEAKER_01]: you interrupt that and send it sideways?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, no, no, you leave everything
natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I said before, all of my,
all of the stuff that people see,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the stuff that I tell people how it
is, is based on a one gallon pot with
[SPEAKER_01]: store bought soil and a little cow poop
and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because you need to have a
standard it's in basic science,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's controls and that's the control.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you're using that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only, if everything is getting the
same light, they're getting the same
[SPEAKER_01]: water, they're getting the same air and,
and they've got all got the same soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that's left is now is for
them to express what the genetics have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you want to find out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's basically that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got another question here,
which says, do you know if any of your
[SPEAKER_00]: current strains you've made are notably
good for migraines?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, GUI is good for migraines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said before, the nerve pain,
it's been notably, you know, like multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: sclerosis and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patients really report a really good
relief from, from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I'm really hot to get that
strain back out on the market because
[SPEAKER_01]: overall it's just a good medical strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has multiple uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very wide spectrum of effects that
are, it can serve a lot of people and
[SPEAKER_01]: migraines are one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one that would be currently
available for that would probably be Afgui
[SPEAKER_01]: Island because it's got a lot of,
it's a, it's, it's our CBD dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really good for pain that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of it out there,
but I know that JBC right now has it in
[SPEAKER_01]: stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were to look to pursue a CBD
project further, would you want to look
[SPEAKER_00]: within the lines you have now to find CBD
or would you consider bringing like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a Charlotte's web type thing in?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've got plenty of stuff to work off
of, including hemp, you know, from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Midwest that is just really has copious
amounts of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wonderful to work with hemp to be my
first choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's an interesting point,
which hasn't really been mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, I think it needs to be,
you know, exploited more because what my
[SPEAKER_01]: company and the website details is that
there's a component that we want to
[SPEAKER_01]: develop where we utilize the refuse of
the, of the industry and turn it into
[SPEAKER_01]: different products and, and be able to
serve the, making the use of the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: plant right on down to the, the stocks
with making it turning building materials
[SPEAKER_01]: and that sort of thing, textiles and,
and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and part of that is the CBD
production because you're going to find
[SPEAKER_01]: that I think whole plant materials works
the best in certain instances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people who are using CBD, I think
would benefit more from whole plant
[SPEAKER_01]: production than just targeted extraction
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot more benefits to it
that way than, than people are crediting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think hemp would be the target for
that because it's just already so rich and
[SPEAKER_01]: well within government compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, regulations for THC and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that's just a quicker avenue
to go bias is using hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I've even found that when you buy a
bird seed that is supposedly sterilized,
[SPEAKER_01]: 30% of that bag, a big bird seed will,
will germinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally it comes from hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if people want a little tip,
they can go out there and get that and try
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll find that they get a
percentage of them to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they can use that as a whole
plant source to be able to, to do the
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they'll really benefit from
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we, we, I've been interested in
getting more information on things like
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the FECO, like the full extract and a
lot of people are just not that
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, you're going to run into that
cause it's so new.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's such a focus on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in here in California, there's so many
people that are, are focused on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really fast developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are getting better refinement.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what they're, they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got specialized people that are
working on these products and you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're really seeing a lot of good
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing more and more of it all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're onto our last little part of the
interview now, which I have to call the
[SPEAKER_00]: quick fire questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hopefully a little more short
response ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one, what was the last strain
to really blow you away?
[SPEAKER_00]: From other people and anything could be
your own work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think, you know, I have to always go
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I love pearl tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pearl tie is one of my favorite ties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the last time that I had a
good pearl tie was several years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's one of those strains that sticks
with you and gives you a perspective that
[SPEAKER_01]: you just don't usually get from pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I love pearl ties.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pearl ties that are around today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Barney's farm has a tie that looks
like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a, the grinspoon strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't quite up to par.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Bodie has a better example.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had some at the cup there this last
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually was handing out handfuls of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as I, he, he, I took a look at
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, Oh darn tie, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, Oh yeah, you know,
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so actually there were some seeds in
that and I've got them growing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see if that continues on,
but it's kind of like Bodie said,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of one of those highs that makes
you sit there and stare at your feet for a
[SPEAKER_01]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that because of the trip I
most recently did that tie from Bodie.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Peltie was definitely the standout to
me and I can attest it'll stay with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was unlike anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to touch on that point you made
about Barney's farm, I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: information that's come out recently is
that you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a tie what they're offering.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually offering an S1 of funnily
enough, a reefer man strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's his one called Senor Garcia,
which was the Oregon blue tie cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's got that look,
but you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much the poster child for that
kind of Peltie alternating calyx look,
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the old days, that pearl,
the Peltie that was like that had a very
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry presence to its flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the stems were just covered in resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just this big space of stem covered
in resin and then a couple of little poofs
[SPEAKER_01]: of flour and then a leaf or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was just so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the high was just so satisfying and
rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the flavor was just overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss that pot probably more than just
about anything other than maybe an old
[SPEAKER_01]: Congolese that I tried in England that was
actually quite frankly the same structure,
[SPEAKER_01]: just really red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you looked into Coastal Seeds work at
all?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they've got access to some nice
Congolese.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I did try that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a matter of fact, and I didn't find
it to be anywhere close to what I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember, what the original stuff was,
I was actually quite disappointed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, you can't, like I said,
I'm really, really picky and it's not fair
[SPEAKER_01]: to them because that work may be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not what I would have targeted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't gravitate towards it as a
result of my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, that's what I was saying
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your history really colors what you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And quite frankly, I'm a dying breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty soon I'll be gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that memory of those types of highs
will go with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, I hate to see that for
young people because, gosh, the history is
[SPEAKER_01]: so rich and so delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sad that more people can't experience
it the way I remember it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, undoubtedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next question is, what's your favorite
smoke right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if I was to pick an outside source
right now, Norstar's Moonshadow,
[SPEAKER_01]: he used the old Mendo Haze in it and he
mixed it in with something else that I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it is, but it's just really,
really, really flavorful and really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really am enjoying that as far as a
smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only have it in full melt, but it's
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I normally don't smoke concentrates and
extracts, but that one I make an exception
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm enjoying that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I just, I constantly
smoke old Mendo Haze, Gooey, Dark Desire,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Midnight Snow as ones that I will go
to day in and day out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Jamaican, if I want a kind of a
spearmint gum kind of a flavor,
[SPEAKER_01]: I will go to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I want to have something that's
nice and cerebral that I have a few
[SPEAKER_01]: individual plants that their origin
escapes me at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are Sativas, one of them is a
Mexican based one that I really enjoy too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, again, I've got too
much material to go through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the smoking I do isn't for
pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically for research to find out
what I want to go to next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know you're not that big into kind
of, you know, strain of the month type
[SPEAKER_00]: things, but out of everything you've tried
over the years, what was the one thing
[SPEAKER_00]: where it was the least memorable to you,
but it seemed to get quite a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: traction with the public?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack the Ripper comes to mind immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: But beyond that, the the old bubblegums,
I was always disappointed in those because
[SPEAKER_01]: I never could find a good bubblegum,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was disappointed, quite frankly,
in the Northern Lights varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that I never could really
understand why they were as popular as
[SPEAKER_01]: they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the White Widows, I never could
understand that either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always thought that they lacked huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, interesting answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry, go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I don't downgrade other
people's work as a as a rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that I'm really picky and I'm it
has to have it all in order to impress me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could only pick either indoor
growing, outdoor growing or greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, which would you pick?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I do all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do all of those and each one has their
purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have to say if I was on a desert
island and I could only have one,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I unfortunately I'd have to say,
oh, I'm torn between greenhouse and indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: only because and I would probably if I had
to choose between those two, I'd have to
[SPEAKER_01]: say indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only reason is, is control
environment completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and and for my purposes, I like a
controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't mean I don't use the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean I don't use greenhouses
because I love greenhouses and I love
[SPEAKER_01]: growing outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I only had one, it would have to be
that it had to be indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have any land race varieties
that you know, you get to crack into,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you kind of thinking to do it in the
future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I still have work to do on something,
some stuff from China.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some Indonesian stuff that I
got a hold of a couple of years back that
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not broken into yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those and I hopefully have a little guy
coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bringing me some stuff from Burma and
I'm looking forward to him handing me
[SPEAKER_01]: those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those things, you know, have to be gone
through and see if they're viable and
[SPEAKER_01]: worth using and see if they've got
anything in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, there's there's all
kinds of stuff on the horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with, like I said, the advent of being
able to to get more space and availability
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to get this stuff out,
we'll get it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could, sorry, sorry,
different question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've kind of touched on it already,
but just for clarification, out of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: old world genetics, you've kind of,
you know, land race, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: close to land race, all the stuff you've
been able to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's been the most unique?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, all the Asian stuff could be lumped
into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ties, the Cambodian, you know,
those those areas, I think just have the
[SPEAKER_01]: most intense presences and the highs are
very rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there's been a lot of areas in
Mexico that I really enjoy the product
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico has a really wide and varied
climate and environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of really incredible,
unique stuff has come from that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even on down, you know, going into
Brazil and some Brazilian material that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had before has just been stunning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't adapt as well going north.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't it loses a lot in the
translation, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Mexico really does seem to be a lot
more stable and does tend to do better up
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say of those, the Asians and
Mexicans are ones that I really enjoy the
[SPEAKER_01]: most.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would if I had to be on a desert
island again, growing indoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are the ones I would use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lucky last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could kind of transfer one quality
from the land races or any strains and you
[SPEAKER_00]: wish that modern genetics would take on
more of these types of traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: what would it be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably that psychoactivity that is that
that field of.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be old to remember this kind
of thing, but I mean, there's there were
[SPEAKER_01]: strains back in the day that would take
your breath away and you would wonder if
[SPEAKER_01]: you were ever, ever going to come down
again, though that those are the kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: things that I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real expressive ones like the old punarota
was one like that, the the tie sticks of
[SPEAKER_01]: old used to really enjoy that,
even though some of them, they said they
[SPEAKER_01]: were adulterated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that I've the seed that I
grew from had a lot of the same qualities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really found that to be a presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it's got to go with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just I really miss the psychoactivity of
it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all become much more sedative and and
or racy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without having that that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quality that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just makes you sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were in a dark room, it would
almost be a kind of a mushroomy kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: experience with visuals and it would,
you know, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss I look for that a lot, even now in
this stuff, because it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to find it and bring it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you do and some people report the
gooey does that to them, it to some
[SPEAKER_01]: degree, if they smoke a lot of it,
because it's really got that edge of that
[SPEAKER_01]: tie and the Cambodia that that really had
those qualities as a predominant part of
[SPEAKER_01]: their high, it got muddied with some of
the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it can come out and I'm going to look
for that in the pure gooey when I make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try and build that back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep our fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that one might bring us to the
end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have any comments or shout outs
you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I really want to thank you very much
for a wonderful interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate the opportunity to
express my views.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I sound like an old stick in the
mud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just fine.
