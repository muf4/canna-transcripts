[SPEAKER_05]: Hello and welcome to the next episode of
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: A cannabis show for budding enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_05]: This episode was brought to you by 420
Australia, The Billy Shop, Organic
[SPEAKER_05]: Gardening Solutions, and All Things
Peabod.
[SPEAKER_05]: On this episode, we're joined by the man
Peabod to talk all things camp dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: So get comfy and enjoy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alrighty, so a big welcome and thank you
for Peabod for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, hello.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for anyone who hasn't seen the earlier
episodes, Peabod and Joe Brand were the
[SPEAKER_05]: two guys who sold the weed to MassG at the
Grateful Dead show, which then went on to
[SPEAKER_05]: give birth to the camp dog strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: But with all that being said, my first
question is, how did you meet Joe Brand?
[SPEAKER_01]: I met Joe B at Western State College.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Gunnison, Colorado in 1987.
[SPEAKER_01]: I applied to a few schools out in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the only one I got into.
[SPEAKER_01]: AKA wasted state.
[SPEAKER_01]: My parents were real proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a great school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a really fun time there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I met him in the cafeteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to get something to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really know anyone there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw him sitting at a table with a
couple other of his friends that he came
[SPEAKER_01]: out from New Jersey with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had tie-dye t-shirts on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grateful Dead t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of drew me over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just went over there and just started
talking to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been friends ever since.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so was it Joe who got you into the
Grateful Dead or were you already into it
[SPEAKER_05]: before that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was already into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was already into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd both gotten into it in high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably got into it my freshman year.
[SPEAKER_01]: In high school, my brother was a big
deadhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we lived.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were a lot of shows right around
us within two, three hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many places they used to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to see many, many shows in high
school.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was a pretty big deadhead by the time
I got out to Western State.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so before we get to that infamous
show, what type of weed were you guys
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking growing up?
[SPEAKER_01]: In Connecticut, I lived about an hour
outside New York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got a lot of strains from other
countries like Vietnam and Afghan,
[SPEAKER_01]: Bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of real tie stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a lot of different flavors that I was
smoking in high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we got out to Western State,
the infamous Peabud we found started
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking that, which is outdoor strain in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big, huge, like forearm size colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you get like a pound just full of
little popcorn buds that were just lime
[SPEAKER_01]: green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And piney tasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, just really beautiful,
beautiful looking pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so was this something that was around
when you had access to the dog,
[SPEAKER_05]: Bud?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or was it before or after that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was before the before the dog,
Bud and during.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I moved there in 87 and
Peabud was around for since at least the
[SPEAKER_01]: early 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think my friend Rob would know a
lot more about that than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was definitely before the dog,
Bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, just kind of segueing into
the dog, Bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was that like for you guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you guys, I think if what I read
was correct was that you had access to
[SPEAKER_05]: that for a while before, you know,
that fateful encounter at Deer Creek.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was so long ago, so I've talked to
Joe and other people and got like the real
[SPEAKER_01]: just a pound and a half came into Crested
Butte the summer of 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Joe Brand bought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he bought a pound of it or all of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guy approached him and because he knew he
Joe and would, you know, had money and
[SPEAKER_01]: could get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he was kind of the Peabud
man, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Joe bought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he bought bought it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think and so and we're going on tour
and I'm not sure in like a couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of, you know, perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we're we kind of took it
took it all on dead tour, which kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: pissed off a lot of people in town because
they couldn't they couldn't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was just absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had never seen anything smell anything
like it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were smoking a lot of Peabud.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're smoking some indoor hash plant,
which is called the Puck Skelly Hash
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant, a puck, which is a pretty famous
one here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you the story on that one,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're smoking that M-39 Big Bud skunk
number one, some good indoor strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had never seen anything like this
or smelled anything like this before we it
[SPEAKER_01]: was called when Joe got it from what it
was called dog bud, because it after you
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke it, it made you roll over like a
dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the meaning of the dog bud
that I remember it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we we smelt it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started calling it chem weed because of
just the the odor off it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smelled chemical fuel, just insane
terpenes, as they say today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just amazing the smell of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we started calling it chem weed,
which kind of just as a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of changed the name to chem
weed and and then brought it not sure
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly how much we brought on tour,
but pretty close to a pound on dead tour.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so these are kind of the days leading
up to that show, am I correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We that was summer of 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure where the tour started,
but that happened at I think there were
[SPEAKER_01]: two shows in Deer Creek that happened at
one of those shows in Deer Creek.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was I think we were just
smoking it ourselves for the first shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we we had split it up into eights
and and just decided to bust it out at
[SPEAKER_01]: Deer Creek.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was it was amazing because it was
summertime, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said before, it's pretty dry
weed in the in the summer on dead tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were a lot of lucky people in
that parking lot that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one really lucky one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when G Masjid came up to you guys,
was it, you know, just just any old moment
[SPEAKER_05]: for you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or did you have some inkling, you know,
like Skung VA mentions when he was first
[SPEAKER_05]: approached with the guy who would give him
the chem dog, like he knew that it was,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, as the guy walked towards him,
he knew it was an important contact.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, did you feel the same way about
Masjid or it was just kind of an everyday
[SPEAKER_05]: thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just kind of a well, it was more
friendly because it was so long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we we just started selling it at our
at Joe's car.
[SPEAKER_01]: At, you know, at Joe's Subaru,
I remember Green Subaru.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started to just say, kind bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one guy came up and he was just like,
holy shit, look at this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he ran off and brought up two people
and they ran off and brought up two
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had like a line at our car to buy
eighths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And G Masjid was one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he bought one or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he came back and bought some more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put him and Joe exchange numbers at the
show there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and then that's how they they stayed
in contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no cell phones back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was more just, you know,
on a piece of paper and I'll call you when
[SPEAKER_01]: I get back to when I get back home.
[SPEAKER_05]: So did you were you aware of the kind of
the exchange that took place after that
[SPEAKER_05]: when you guys got back and then Joe sent
him the stuff in the mail or you weren't
[SPEAKER_05]: fully aware of that at the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he sent him some Peabod first and
then sent him the dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm sure we're all like, I don't send
it to him, you know, very glad he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, because that was that was
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was we never saw it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dog, but I've never seen it since.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's probably a little like,
don't send it to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think he sent him two outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had never seen a seed in any of the
stuff that I smoked or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I did, I didn't save it for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, one of those some of those
buds receded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and Greg found in one of the ounces,
I guess, I think Joe sent him two ounces
[SPEAKER_01]: and one of the ounces he found the 13
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when he found those seeds, did he
mention to you that he found them straight
[SPEAKER_05]: away or was it more of just on the back
burner thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: No cell phones back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of just lost touch with MassG
for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't keep in touch with them at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Joe probably did a little bit,
but then, you know, just fell out of fell
[SPEAKER_01]: out of touch with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, he can, you know, MassG,
if you can get him on, he can definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The story from there finding the seeds and
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't really get back in touch with
him until, you know, oh, five,
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, 2005.
[SPEAKER_01]: From just on the internet and seeing the
sour diesel bud and from Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Joe kind of put two and two
together and was online for a couple years
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to corroborate this story of
meeting MassG and sending them that and it
[SPEAKER_01]: being the dog bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and then I was back East and got a bag
of the sour diesel and like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: four or something and called Joe,
Joe Brand in California was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff smells just like the dog bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was telling me about this story
online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, I guess, JJ from Top Dog got
MassG and Joe together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and yeah, from then on that they they
reconnected and she sent him Joe,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, for the remaining seeds that he
had left.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how they got back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, I got two little questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that was the whole reunion thing
that people talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the second part is, does that
mean that, you know, essentially you and
[SPEAKER_05]: Joe were just doing your own thing for
about 10 years and the chem dogs were in
[SPEAKER_05]: existence, so to speak, but you weren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we weren't smoking them or or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was nice to, you know, reconnect
with MassG and and those guys and and get
[SPEAKER_01]: those things, get those genetics for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you did kind of put the story
together slash, you know, at whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: point you did believe it all, were you
just like kind of surprised by,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, how many killer cuts had come
from those 13 seeds?
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it all a bit overwhelming at first?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy how that one strain has changed
the, you know, the face of the weed world
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I mean, I knew we knew it back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd never seen anything better than the
dog until, you know, we hooked back up
[SPEAKER_01]: with MassG and got the, you know,
the Chem 91 and the D and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then, you know, Joe popped the four
and.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, it just never seen
anything like it before in our lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when you were first exposed to all
the chem dogs, what was your initial
[SPEAKER_05]: favorite?
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked the 91 the best at first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe the best question is how in what
order were you exposed to them?
[SPEAKER_01]: In order, I was exposed 90.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we hooked back up with MassG and I was
in Connecticut and I would meet him up at
[SPEAKER_01]: the the Basketball Hall of Fame in
Springfield.
[SPEAKER_01]: MassG is just such a nice guy that,
you know, he'd drive, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how long it was for him,
but we'd meet there and he'd have this
[SPEAKER_01]: package for me, you know, of just all the
chems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I got exposed to the 91D and then,
you know, the chem crosses that he did,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bubble chem and then I got exposed to
the chem sister.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I liked the 91 at first, the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought after years, it kind of got the
taste kind of faded.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've smoked some recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last few years from Duke and it's,
you know, it's he brings the flavor out
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's funny you mention that because
I mean, when I first tried it,
[SPEAKER_05]: I was surprised by how like, you know,
weak or absent the flavor was.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, I was also surprised
by how it was more present than I thought
[SPEAKER_05]: it would be at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that sounds very paradoxical,
but yeah, it's the strength still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's still just as strong as but
the D that is, you know, the smell is
[SPEAKER_01]: still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The taste is still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just reeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know a lot of people love that
just rotten smelling, funky, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: yuck smelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife calls it yuck, yuck, but it just
smells just nasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people like I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of other people love it,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so do you find that the D is,
I don't know, I refer to it as like more
[SPEAKER_05]: functional than the 91 or do you think
it's just still too crippling?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crippling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's closer than 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the 91 is probably the strongest
of all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got no ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you just get higher and higher and
higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: D is pretty close though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think Skunk mentioned that your
now favorite is the D.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the truth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's taken over in the years,
just the smell and the taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the 91 is a close second.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I guess my question is,
why do you think that the 81, sorry,
[SPEAKER_05]: the D, why do you think that the D has
been able to maintain those
[SPEAKER_05]: characteristics while the 91 has faded
off?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as old.
[SPEAKER_01]: He popped Chem D in 2000, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's nine years, you know, younger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably the biggest reason,
I would think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if we go back to the story slash
our little timeline, so if we just jump
[SPEAKER_05]: back to when G sent Joe those further
beans, obviously you were in the loop at
[SPEAKER_05]: that point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you really excited for what was going
to come out of those beans?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe Brown was in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I moved out there and moved in
with them shortly after he got those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the one Chem one, two, three,
and four, four was, you know, the best Joe
[SPEAKER_01]: thought it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely the biggest producer of
all the chems.
[SPEAKER_01]: The D is, you know, probably close second.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Joe kind of picked that one out as
the best one and really was generous with
[SPEAKER_01]: it and gave it to, you know, a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gave the one, two, and three to a few
people that think there's a couple people
[SPEAKER_01]: that have the three and maybe one or two
people that have the chem one and two.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were more, from what I remember,
more OG like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not as big, not as a big producer,
smaller buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the four was the one that called the
reunion phenome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe named it that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the people in the chem family
don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, but it's, I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the different smell from the rest for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I think a lot of turns a lot of
people off, but I think it's really strong
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I wasn't the biggest fan of it,
but I think it's cause it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won the Adam Duncup this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's saying something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's saying something.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, it was the taste.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it was like, yeah, but just not as
good in taste wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a different taste than,
than the others for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the strength is, is,
is right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think with all of the chem dogs that the
strength is always there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've heard some rumours from some
people that the, the pheno one that you
[SPEAKER_05]: just mentioned that that may have been the
plant, which went on to be that infamous
[SPEAKER_05]: Joe brand 91.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you be able to shed any light on
that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you got any opinions on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: On the Joe brand, the Joe B 91?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I'm not really sure where that one came
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I kind of have an idea,
but I kind of really don't want to want to
[SPEAKER_01]: get into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of confusing a confusing issue
that I really can't really agree with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't explain.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, maybe it's good though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's people here in Denver that
have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there are people who still breed
with it because they think it's that good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, obviously they name it
correctly, but, but yeah, I mean,
[SPEAKER_05]: one of the things I find so interesting
about it is there seems to have been so
[SPEAKER_05]: many fake 91s.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't just mean like outright fake
as in some random person has it,
[SPEAKER_05]: but as in like maybe someone close to the
chem fam or even in the chem fam has a cut
[SPEAKER_05]: at one point and they think it's the right
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it turns out it's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just seems so like there's so many
of the 91 out of all the cuts,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it was the one which there would
seem to be like the most replicas floating
[SPEAKER_05]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's, I would have to say it's the
hardest one to get the original,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the real besides the one and
two, but of the ones that are out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the 91 is definitely the toughest
one to get if, you know, and I think a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people have, I've ruined, I've ruined a
lot of people's day when they send me
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures and I got to just tell them that
it's definitely not it or they'll smoke me
[SPEAKER_01]: out on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to tell them it's not it,
but yeah, it's definitely, I would have to
[SPEAKER_01]: say the hardest one to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, you know, thank God that,
you know, skunk VA has, has protected that
[SPEAKER_01]: thing over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: These years for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's a special one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to kind of put this point to bed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I, I don't know how, but I get a lot
of messages.
[SPEAKER_05]: People telling me the same thing that
they've got the real 91.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why they're messaging me,
but I say the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's probably not it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my question is, has, has anyone,
you know, like, and I don't mean to be
[SPEAKER_05]: rude to the people, but like just a random
person, not associated with you really in
[SPEAKER_05]: any way, has anyone ever like sent you a
photo and you were like, Hey, that's the
[SPEAKER_05]: real deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is it always like, sorry, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much always, cause it's,
you know, it's mostly people I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know who kind of has that cut out
there, but most of the time it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's no, I mean, I'll see it on,
on the internet, you know, and different,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, different media web.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see it and I'll be like, yeah,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of the people that send me
pictures it's not, it's not it or smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what were your thoughts on the
initial chem dog hybrids?
[SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned the bubble cam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think another one G made was the dog
waltz.
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you feel about those?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's JJ's dog waltz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the chem crosses are, are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunk V or IC collective or Skunk VA has
that chem scout, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the best crosses that I've,
one of the best chem crosses I've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem D by I-95 is a really, really good
chem cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, they're, they're all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really are.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have the real chem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when you saw how good these were as
breeding stock, essentially, did the
[SPEAKER_05]: thought ever cross your mind to do a bit
of breeding yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've never really been interested in
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let that to my buddies, but I'm,
I've always just been straight clone and
[SPEAKER_01]: kept mothers alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of what I've done
preservation and never really gotten into
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always had, I was a golf course
superintendent for, for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I always had a career and working,
you know, 80 hours a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I never really had the,
the time growing was always just a really
[SPEAKER_01]: part-time or growing marijuana was always
a very part-time thing for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always did it, but just part-time growing
golf courses was my full-time gig.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you transition into the job you
have now, which is incredible edibles?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, when my son was born, he's four now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, we didn't really want to put him in
daycare at that young of age.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my wife makes a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided to stay home and take care of
Bobby for few first few years of his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this past year he was old enough to
go to, we wanted to get him into daycare
[SPEAKER_01]: and nursery school and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So time for me to get back to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked for a lead cannabis for a little
bit, a great company and up in Longmont
[SPEAKER_01]: and they do CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was working in their greenhouse and
managing their, their garden supply store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then wanted something a little more
closer to home and kind of put my name out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Derek contacted me and it was really
the company that I wanted to work for
[SPEAKER_01]: because they just have such a good
reputation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just put out such a good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're everywhere in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to work for a good,
good company and things worked out and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and yeah, very happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if we would have kind of talk a bit
more about the edibles, do you find that
[SPEAKER_05]: the chem dog strains work specifically
well for edibles or not really about
[SPEAKER_05]: potency?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of other factors involved in
what strains make for good edibles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not, we're going to get, I'm, we're
working on getting the chem four first in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in start growing that and doing,
I think it'll work better with the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the live resin and the dabbing and the,
you know, the oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'll make for a fantastic,
I've smoked some chem four oil before and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's what we're going to do
with the chem four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it works better, better,
better for oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, I mean, you know, this may be out
of your kind of realm of scope,
[SPEAKER_05]: but do you find or ever get any feedback
of the strains that you're growing that
[SPEAKER_05]: they're specifically good for edibles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's something I wouldn't,
I wouldn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just are, I'm just locked in that
warehouse and growing, growing the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I, yeah, I need to get to the other
parts of the company, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: just been concentrating on the,
on the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that would be someone else's
incredible skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd have to ask on, on the what's good
for, you know, candy bars and that.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when speaking to skunk, there was a
funny moment he described where,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, he got back on the forums and,
you know, he was kind of unaware of how
[SPEAKER_05]: the community perceived him in this sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, you know, as like, you know,
a very well-respected figure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you ever feel that way about yourself?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, do you ever have to pinch yourself
and say like, Hey, like I'm a bit of a
[SPEAKER_05]: figure in the cannabis scene or do you
just not really view it that way?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, I know I am, but I don't really
view it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just kind of just living my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, it doesn't seem that exciting,
but, but we had, you know, we had good
[SPEAKER_01]: times, dead tour and met a lot of people
and smoked a lot of weed and saved a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so, we're just kind of
living, living our life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just amazing that what I just get
blown away on the, on the, on the weed
[SPEAKER_01]: that that dog bud has created.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, it, it amazes me that,
you know, G mass G found those seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: what became of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, this is an interesting point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always think about is I think G was,
I think he was 17 at the time of the
[SPEAKER_05]: concert and maybe he was 18 when he popped
the seeds, but he is a young man.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the thing which always stands out in
my mind was that he was very young when he
[SPEAKER_05]: popped those seeds and regardless of if it
was him or friends close to him,
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you know, those clones have managed
to live on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever been like surprised or,
you know, maybe more so impressed with how
[SPEAKER_05]: someone that young was able to kind of
hang onto things loosely for all that
[SPEAKER_05]: time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I just think it's amazing the
insight he had that I, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have, we could have had seeds,
you know, and just thrown them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was one of those guys that went around
and was looking for seeds and at a young
[SPEAKER_01]: age, which is, you know, pretty,
pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to do what he did with those seeds is,
is very impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so have you ever really spoken to him
about how many people he actually gave it
[SPEAKER_05]: out to?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, I mean, I've heard from a lot of
people and you even mentioned it earlier
[SPEAKER_05]: yourself, that G is just a really nice
guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, he, he does a lot for a lot
of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've always heard that he was never a
hoarder per se, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_05]: I always hear that, you know, like no one
has the real chem dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it seems almost like paradoxical,
like the guy who's got the real one seems
[SPEAKER_05]: to give it out, but no one has it at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they held him pretty tight in
their circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm not totally sure you'd have to
ask him on that one, but just because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just not, you know, it's just not out
there after 25 years, you think it would
[SPEAKER_01]: be out there a lot more, but it's just
not, it's just not.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the conclusions I thought might've
been the case was that like the people he
[SPEAKER_05]: was giving it to, they, they realized kind
of the magnitude of the situation and they
[SPEAKER_05]: decided not to give it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause that could kind of explain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you get something,
you're like, Oh my God, this is,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is special.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to keep it, you know, for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, a lot of people,
you know, we'll take these and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, go make, try to make money off
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, I, I don't really give
them to anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, just out of respect for those guys
and just, uh, I don't want people to go
[SPEAKER_01]: take it and go make a ton of money off it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I really don't give them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get asked a lot, but I just can't,
I spent all my time at the post office,
[SPEAKER_01]: mailing, mailing cuts to people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so how do you feel about people who
are making money off it?
[SPEAKER_05]: And more specifically, especially when
you're pretty much a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_05]: certain it's not even real.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the part I don't like when you're
just using the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, anyone can throw a name on
something and trick people into,
[SPEAKER_01]: into buying their product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the guys that put out a good product
and have taken the chem dog strains and
[SPEAKER_01]: like JJ, for instance, and, and made
really good quality genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: With them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think it's, I think it's
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that are being deceitful and
calling this chem 91 or calling this a
[SPEAKER_01]: chem whatever and chem whatever,
and not having real chem genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, that, that kind of rubs me wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, on that same note,
do you think that, uh, just generally
[SPEAKER_05]: speaking, we will be able to put the chem
dog into seed form or do you think it's
[SPEAKER_05]: just one of those one in a millions?
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, even if you could find the
parents and do it, most of the seeds may
[SPEAKER_05]: not come out as strong or, you know,
as similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally, I don't think you're ever
going to get that, that you're never going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get, you know, exactly what,
you know, the clone is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't think that's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can get something close,
but, uh, I think skunk VAs working on
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's, uh, lucky dog seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I, that's what I'd be waiting
for, uh, his work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want something close,
you know, like start JJ's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the star dogs are really strong and
there's a lot of crosses out there that
[SPEAKER_01]: are really strong, but just, you're not
going to get, you know, the real,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the chem 91 or the chem D or the chem
four.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: With that in mind, do you, do you want to
kind of see G get into doing some seeds of
[SPEAKER_05]: his own?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause we've heard whispers of maybe him
doing something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would love it now that,
you know, Massachusetts is legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he told me he was going to,
he wanted to do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I think that would be,
you know, he deserves it the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he's really the one that there wasn't
for him, you know, no one would be
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking, no one would be smoking the
chems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, anything he succeeds that makes
me happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I speak for everyone when we say
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so you mentioned earlier that Joe was
online.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, were you ever really going online or
not until the story kind of got pieced
[SPEAKER_05]: together and you realized that there were
people online who knew about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I think it was online before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I started on the overgrow and then
the IC mag, uh, and I just picked PBOT as,
[SPEAKER_01]: as, uh, my handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the IC mag, this guy with that
name high and lonesome, uh, Virginia,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe, uh, he kind of laid out the
whole chem dog one-on-one story on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, really good at pictures and the
whole story pretty, pretty accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he did research and talked to
everyone and that's kind of how the whole,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, and that was 15, 15 years ago or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of how the whole PBOT and Joe
brand and internet thing kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of blew up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say that's actually,
uh, an amazing thread for anyone who
[SPEAKER_05]: hasn't looked at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You go, go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can search chem dog one-on-one and IC
magnets.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the name of that pictures and yeah,
chem dog one-on-one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of lays out the whole story.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just killer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Joe, Joe actually comments on it just
under like, uh, in one of the first
[SPEAKER_05]: comments, he's like just under a guest
profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like he didn't even have an account at
that point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like, he's just like,
Hey, I'm, I'm that guy from the story.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one believed him first.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he basically post proof and it's
like, Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Joe did a lot of, I mean,
he was on the internet for a few years,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, trying to sell that, sell the story,
which was true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, finally, uh, I mean,
he must've said it so many, so many times
[SPEAKER_01]: on the internet, jumping into forums and
saying, this is, you know, where it came
[SPEAKER_01]: from and just got shut down for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally got, uh, reconnected with
mass G and, uh, yeah, vindication.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so after you did reconnect with mass G
through Joe B or whatever it may be,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, did you stay in contact with him or
was it still kind of a sporadic
[SPEAKER_05]: relationship?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've stayed contact with them since,
you know, Oh six.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been, you know, we were saw him at
the dead shows last year in Chicago and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, talk, talk a bunch of,
you know, text and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we, we keep in touch for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, I buy, I buy a pipe from
it, you know, every six months.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to get a little, um, so basically
when, when G went down due to that whole
[SPEAKER_05]: rez business, were you, were you just
peripheral to that or were you kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I was pretty peripheral to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, there was, uh, and I guess they
got the last couple seeds to, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: the feds got the last two seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, which was too bad, but yeah,
I was kind of not really around him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so did you have any, um, experience
with Rez because it's like, I mean,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's, it's almost a taboo thing to talk
about Rez, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_05]: what I find most interesting about it is
for all the negative things he's done,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's almost just as many people who
want to talk about how good his chem dog
[SPEAKER_05]: crosses were.
[SPEAKER_01]: People loved his chem dog crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, uh, I only knew him just from the
internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just had a, you know, big attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, wasn't afraid to get
into it with people and, uh, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: he made some good crosses, but,
uh, yeah, just not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a bad, yeah, bad, just don't like to
talk and talk about the guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's no worries.
[SPEAKER_05]: When, when G was in jail, I mean,
this might just be totally unrelated,
[SPEAKER_05]: but like, I mean, how did that affect chem
family and more so like what, is chem
[SPEAKER_05]: family just this loose term to you or is
it actually something more than that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, uh, I think it's,
I mean, that's what it's kind of loose
[SPEAKER_01]: term, but it's, you know, there's,
you know, people that know the story and
[SPEAKER_01]: that are involved in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, friends of G's friends
of, you know, my JJ, those guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, Joe's, but yeah, it's kind of
different groups of people, I guess
[SPEAKER_01]: together that are associated with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so have you guys ever thought about
like, uh, maybe pushing is not the right
[SPEAKER_05]: word, but you know, like creating a brand
similar to the way cookie fam have done
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, in my opinion, they've
almost, uh, detached themselves from being
[SPEAKER_05]: a hundred percent associated with cannabis
and it's more just a brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you know, have you ever, have you
guys ever thought about that with the chem
[SPEAKER_05]: fam?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think about it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would, I would love to,
uh, it's just, we're kind of all
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Areas of the country and doing different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I've always had a career and
just, you know, just the, the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, would love to someday would love
to, I know the mass G has the copyright or
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of that got the name chem dog or chem
family or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, who knows?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Duke told us the story about how you ended
up getting pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how do you feel about chem dog being
put into feminized form, regardless of
[SPEAKER_05]: which cutting it is?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the reason why I asked that is
because it's one of those strains where
[SPEAKER_05]: you, you really never find a real deal
chem 91 feminized or a real deal chem
[SPEAKER_05]: de-feminized.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think that's something which the
chem fam has thought about and thought
[SPEAKER_05]: like, we don't want that to happen,
or it's just, you guys thought they
[SPEAKER_05]: wouldn't like the seeds themselves
wouldn't turn out very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or what's your opinion on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I would love to see it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but I would like to see, you know,
skunk VA or mass G or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of those guys do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not, you know, not, you know, not anyone
else.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think that's what, um,
is a really good reason to be getting
[SPEAKER_05]: skunk stuff because as far as I'm
concerned, like, I don't know if I'd
[SPEAKER_05]: really trust many people except for like,
you know, you and Tommy to be,
[SPEAKER_05]: have the legitimate 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I, I would jump on the skunk VA
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually, my friend got some for me and
at the Emerald cup, uh, which you were out
[SPEAKER_01]: at, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so he's got those in Durango for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So next time I see him, I'm going to grab
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm after those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's, uh, I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited for those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not a seed guy at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, but I'm excited for this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a question I've been asking
everyone in the chem fam.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I might not actually get an
answer until I can ask G himself,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I remember reading this post online
and it said that like, I think it was from
[SPEAKER_05]: like G's point of view, like he was
writing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, and he said that he always found
that like chem, it just said chem dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I assume maybe it means the 91.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, he said that that always came out best
if you grew it organically, but then in
[SPEAKER_05]: the later part of flower, it used like a
synthetic PK booster and it really brought
[SPEAKER_05]: out the chem flavour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know if there's any truth to that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever heard anyone say anything
like that or not?
[SPEAKER_05]: You couldn't really comment on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, I couldn't really comment on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I just know I, I'm, I'm not an
organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm like 80% organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, and I take, I guess taking it,
a lot of people take it to 70 days and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, Duke likes to take it and I
think skunk VA too, a lot, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: shorter than that, like 60 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, they say that really brings out
the flavour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, let it go too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gets more of a narcotic high and the taste
kind of, kind of fades.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got some now going in my basement
that I'm going to take it 60 days this
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always taken it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to give that a shot and see
what happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, with that in mind,
what was the strongest batch of 91 you've
[SPEAKER_05]: ever had and, and who grew it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have to, I mean, just the first
time I really smoked it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was from G from G.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to say from him, just,
just, you know, memory is just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: wow, just, uh, so strong and just brought
me back to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking that dog bud and Crested Butte on
dead tour in 1991.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd have to say mass G's the best 91
I've smoked with Tommy, Tommy,
[SPEAKER_01]: a close second.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever, have you ever tried skunks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I, Tommy actually says that he
thinks I've tried, I've tried his and his
[SPEAKER_01]: is phenomenal too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I've, I've had more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when you, I mean, just going back
to when you were first smoking the 91,
[SPEAKER_05]: for example, was it just like,
I mean, I try to describe to people what
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking the 91 is like, and I,
all I can say is like, it's just a
[SPEAKER_05]: different beast.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like it's really just
uncomparable to a lot of strains in many
[SPEAKER_05]: regards.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, did you feel that way at first?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, was there anything that could
compare to it at all?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or was it just so foreign at the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because I hadn't smoked, you know,
we smoked the dog bud 91 that summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, I smoked the 91 and
not until like, Oh five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, yeah, it was absolutely just
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The narcotic high it has and the expand
that expand this in your lungs where you
[SPEAKER_01]: try to hold it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, it's just growing and
expanding in your lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got to just, you got to blow it
out and, uh, and then just instantly,
[SPEAKER_01]: instantly high after it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, just strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just strong, strong weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the first time I had it,
I think I almost kind of greened out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I totally understand what you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says, you don't get immune to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, uh, it's great medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you have stomach problems or
um, you know, anything like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's great for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, the dog bud, you know,
that's often referenced as, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, the parent or maybe just loosely as
like the closest thing to the chem dog,
[SPEAKER_05]: at least back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, you also mentioned the skelly
hash plant, which is kind of a new cut
[SPEAKER_05]: that's come on the scene.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do you think the chem dog originates
from?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a lot of debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the dog bud from, um, people that have
over the years that have asked the guys
[SPEAKER_01]: that brought it into Crested Butte,
where it came from was like some valley in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon, uh, where it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it was being grown there,
uh, uh, indoors there or not, but that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where I heard it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the Camus, Camus Valley in Oregon,
I think is what it was called.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we still don't, you know, don't know
for sure, uh, where it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: The skelly hash plant is, uh, that was
from 1987, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, friends of friends went over to
Amsterdam and brought, bought some seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: just labeled hash plant in a coffee shop
in Amsterdam and brought them back,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, to Leadville.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I think there were six seeds and
this, this one was the, was the keeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, it went to Crested Butte
and, uh, a guy named Skelly, that was his
[SPEAKER_01]: nickname, was kind of the guy that grew
it, was kind of the master of growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and that's where it came.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skelly hash plant, uh, it was called and
then kind of got renamed the puck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, because my friend would go over,
my friend Fatty would go over to my friend
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob's house and always go, do you have any
of the puck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any of the puck?
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally they were like, what the heck
are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: And Rob had kept his hash plant in this
fly fishing, uh, container that holds
[SPEAKER_01]: flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a plastic and it was black from
the resin and it looked like a hockey
[SPEAKER_01]: puck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Fatty would, he just kind of named it
the puck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so he must've spread that around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've, I've lost contact with him,
but he must've spread that around Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty, pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so when I got back, I moved up
here to Denver and with a friend and he's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I go, yeah, I got this string on
this hash plant string.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, really old.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, oh, you mean the puck?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, I just put two and two
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, Fatty, he were just,
he's just one of the funniest guys I ever
[SPEAKER_01]: met.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he spread that word around Colorado,
the pucks, they kind of changed the name
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but it's just an old, uh, strong,
another really just strong, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: strong string.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's another one that's in a
league of its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, it's just, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever seen anything that maybe,
you know, the third in that trifecta or do
[SPEAKER_05]: you think at the moment, the 91 and the
Parker in a league of their own,
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much in a league of own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have, they always,
you know, we've smoked that hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're smoking P bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the hash plant, Skelly hash plant
puck came around and that just was just
[SPEAKER_01]: insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've really never compared
anything to the hash plant except the dog
[SPEAKER_01]: bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those two really are just the two,
uh, strongest, most incredible strains
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how do you, how do you deal with people
trying to give you, you know, quote,
[SPEAKER_05]: the real history of the chem dog?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it at the point now where you've had so
many people try to tell you, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: about your life and you just don't even
care anymore?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you just, we just got into the guy on
Instagram the other day, but his uncle was
[SPEAKER_01]: his uncle had the chem dog before mass G
and, and it was always spelled D A W G.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, it's a, you know,
weekly monthly thing at least,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, but I've heard so many, so many
stories and so many people's claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's just frustrating because we
lived it and I know it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it was our life and,
you know, mass G's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, those are the guys that
should get credit for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, Joe brand and, you know,
those guys, so when people try to take
[SPEAKER_01]: credit for it, it's, uh, no, it's pretty
weak, but, uh, it's, I'm used to it now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, I mean, it's probably a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people have asking is that,
um, or thinking in their mind is that Joe
[SPEAKER_05]: brand's been seemingly absent from the
scene for awhile.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think he'll ever pop his head back
up or maybe he's not interested?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, he's never really been a,
you know, internet and out there kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, I hope someday he does,
but, uh, I tried to call him and see if he
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to do, do this interview,
but, uh, I didn't get in touch with him,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, you know, hopefully someday,
you know, he will, uh, I love the guy and
[SPEAKER_01]: hope for the best one for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so maybe a little left of the last
question is you've been around long enough
[SPEAKER_05]: now that you've, you've seen strains come
and go, and you've probably seen far more
[SPEAKER_05]: quote fad strains than just blue dream and
girls get cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think will stand the test of
time and what do you think is hot right
[SPEAKER_05]: now that's going to pass?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I mean, I, I'm really starting to get
into all the OGs like TK and the SFV and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, I think those things will
always be around, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the headband and, uh, uh, all those,
you know, those good, like I think TK and
[SPEAKER_01]: SFV are just two of the best OGs out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I think they'll, they'll stay on
the test of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and whatever people can, you know,
that chem scout is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, the J.J.
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so there's a lot of people getting
more and more chem crosses out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I think, you know, if you have a
good chem cross, it'll stay on the test of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was going to say, how does that
star killer you've been raving about line
[SPEAKER_05]: up to those?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm not a big fan of,
uh, the Scott's OG or the Rugby.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're good, but this star killer
is a step above.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, uh, it's right up there with,
with some of the better OGs for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one, I think it's one multiple,
multiple awards too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so this is my first time growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, uh, I'm excited to see,
I got about 30 more days on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_05]: So have you got a little seed library of
your own?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you probably do, but the question
is what, what's the next thing you're
[SPEAKER_05]: excited to pop?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I'm always interested to know,
you know, like what, what are you
[SPEAKER_05]: personally interested to get going soon?
[SPEAKER_01]: I give people give me seeds all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do have a pretty good selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what I do is just cause I don't have
really the space and the time as I give
[SPEAKER_01]: them to good, good friends and have better
into, you know, popping seeds and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, and then they'll find good stuff and
then I can get clones of that or,
[SPEAKER_01]: or, uh, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, these Kendall, a chem seeds I
got, uh, which is Kim D by 95.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, my buddy just popped some of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so yeah, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually harvested some of that,
uh, and it turned out great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, but yeah, mostly I, I,
I give seeds to a couple of good buddies
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, and they, they pop them and we
see what we get.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so in terms of your personal garden,
are you like, uh, kind of like just a few
[SPEAKER_05]: strains and they're your staples and you
just run them or are you always
[SPEAKER_05]: experimenting or are you like,
you know, me and do call it the,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, or is it the lonely Island weed where,
you know, you just throw the ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like just I'm growing now just for,
you know, personal use where before I grow
[SPEAKER_01]: for income.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I was growing for income,
it was more one strain and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the money strain, the big producer,
uh, now I grow a nice, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: nice variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got, you know, SFETK star killer,
Kim D by 95, uh, Kim 91, Kim D.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got, you know, all those going right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, uh, it's nice to have different
flavors for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And have you ever had someone tell you
that like a Kim dog cut was specifically
[SPEAKER_05]: good for a certain condition?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I remember when I asked Tommy this,
he said that the Kim 91 is great for
[SPEAKER_05]: people who want to gain weight because it
gives you the munchies, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, have you ever heard anyone say,
you know, this is good for Crohn's or
[SPEAKER_05]: something like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Crohn's like chem four.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple of people that,
uh, have Crohn's and love the chem four,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, works, works great for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I guess stronger strains, I don't
know, may, may work for that, that
[SPEAKER_01]: disease, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then, you know, I know the Kim 91
is good for any stomach issue for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got me through my stomach flu last year
during four 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so yeah, it's, they're, they're great
medicinal strains for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And do you ever see Kim dog being explored
more by the general public as a medicinal
[SPEAKER_05]: strain or you think it's just not,
it's, I mean, I guess the way I think
[SPEAKER_05]: about it is it seems like it's like,
um, like a bandaid for a bullet in some
[SPEAKER_05]: ways, you know, like it's, it's a very
broad act.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and specifics, uh, I would love to see
it, you know, used in medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how, uh, you know,
the side effects are, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just not sure on, you know,
the medicinal part of the chems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but I, I know for Crohms, chem four
and stomach issues, any chem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be interesting to see
like, uh, you know, a 91 or a D cross to a
[SPEAKER_05]: really strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so this is just a bit of a pot
question here, but I think it's a good
[SPEAKER_05]: one.
[SPEAKER_05]: The 91 show itself, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Despite everything that happened,
you know, it was going down as a legendary
[SPEAKER_05]: show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember the show itself?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, was it actually a good show?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I thought, wouldn't it be so ironic
if like arguably the most important,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, dead show cannabis history was
actually a mediocre one in terms of music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for me, uh, the day kind of started
going downhill 91, you know, after Brent
[SPEAKER_01]: died, he died 90.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I wasn't a big Vince fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Bruce Tornsby played with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: For awhile, but he had stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just remember a Jack straw bertha
opener, which is like my favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: combination opener.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but, uh, don't really remember the
show too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the dead were kind of, you know,
91, 91 was a good year.
[SPEAKER_01]: 92, 93, 94, 95 were all kind of,
uh, the scene was getting bad and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, Jerry was just ill and, uh,
the dead were good when they were healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, straight up, straight up, you know,
when they were healthy, they were good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jerry was all fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was sloppy and, uh,
the shows are still good, but they weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: great when like 1990 was probably the
last, uh, great, great year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, spring tour 90 was probably the great
last great year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a good show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good, cool venue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deer Creek is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's out in the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, like farmland and corn fields and
camping and fun times.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, the grateful dead, you know,
they kind of passed on the torch
[SPEAKER_05]: metaphorically to fish when they kind of
finished up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've never heard of there being,
you know, that same impact on the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: scene as what the dead had.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like I've never heard of there
being like a car park scene at a fish
[SPEAKER_05]: show, for example.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think that that was a cam,
uh, sorry, a grateful dead exclusive
[SPEAKER_05]: thing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, do you think we'll ever get another,
you know, uh, I don't know how to say it,
[SPEAKER_05]: like cannabis revolution, the way we did
with the grateful dead or not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's people are getting them
getting it other places now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, uh, I think back then it was,
I mean, like skunk VA said is she said
[SPEAKER_01]: this or someone said this, that,
you know, dead tour was kind of like the
[SPEAKER_01]: first Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so it was a way of connecting with
people and you knew they were going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: at that next menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so it was kind of, uh,
I don't know if fish does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really go, I've never been to a
fish show before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but yeah, I'm not really sure if what
the scene is like there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I probably couldn't, uh, comment on
that, but I know the dead was the first,
[SPEAKER_01]: the first Facebook really for social
media.
[SPEAKER_05]: And do you think that besides,
uh, the chem dog, the, the quote car park
[SPEAKER_05]: scene of the grateful dead contributed a
lot to cannabis in terms of like
[SPEAKER_05]: recognizable strains?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, had you ever heard of like,
oh, someone got, you know, like a TK cut a
[SPEAKER_05]: dead show or like, it seems like chem dog
is the big one that gets talked about in
[SPEAKER_05]: regards to the grateful dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem dogs definitely the, the big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think more, it was more of,
you know, selling flowers at the,
[SPEAKER_01]: at the show, selling, selling buds and,
uh, and you know, I'm sure, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cuts and stuff like that were traded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but the chem dog one is the,
is the, is the big one that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: most people associate with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, how do you feel about the OG
in relation to the chem dog?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I mean, I realized just as I asked
that question, there was a big major flaw
[SPEAKER_05]: in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, in my mind, I feel like the chem
dog is either the daughter or a sister or
[SPEAKER_05]: like some, some close relative to the chem
dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, you're probably not going to
get an OG cut at a grateful dead show back
[SPEAKER_05]: in the day, but how do you feel all of
that relates together?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you of the same school of thought that
it's probably, some close relative or?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're, I think they're related
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think OG is, uh, just, uh,
you know, an S one from a bag of 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I mean, I can't prove it, but that's
my thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think now that I'm growing OGs,
they, they, they remind me of the 91,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, not as big a bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they, they definitely remind me of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, that's, that's what I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the OG question is kind of a tough one
to crack for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you were in G's position back in
that time when, you know, he was fresh 17
[SPEAKER_05]: or 18, do you think you would have been
able to keep the cuts alive as well as he
[SPEAKER_05]: did?
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on my back at that young,
probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just cause I wouldn't have had the,
I wouldn't have had the spot to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, just so living just at my parents'
house and I wouldn't have been able to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to do that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but thank God he did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the reason I'm just so amazed,
like I just, I, I, I don't, I haven't,
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't met anyone who's truthfully said
that like, yes, I could have been in that
[SPEAKER_05]: position and also kept those cuts alive
for all those years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it's just so mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just, uh, yeah, the work and,
uh, that he did to keep those alive,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, and the crosses and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever asked him why he waited such
long periods of time in between popping
[SPEAKER_05]: the successive seeds?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I've always wondered, why did he wait
four years between popping the first and
[SPEAKER_05]: the next batch?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not sure why he did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think he knew he had something
special and didn't want to blow it all
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe, uh, and do it over, over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, just nice because he sent those four
seeds to Joe, which was, which was pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I mean, a lot of people probably
really kind of, I don't know how to phrase
[SPEAKER_05]: it, you know, like they probably think,
and I wouldn't have done that if they're
[SPEAKER_05]: in his position, you know, given that he
knew what the seeds were at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, no, I, I, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was huge of him to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just such a nice, nice thing because
after Joe got back and touch him and he
[SPEAKER_01]: could have just been like, oh yeah,
nice to, nice, nice to talk to you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can have some cuts,
but you know, not enough for the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think that was a great thing
you did.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, not necessarily in relation to
giving the seeds to Joe, cause obviously
[SPEAKER_05]: that was a very nice thing to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're in G's position,
would you have ever done it differently?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like would you have popped them all at the
start or just sat on them for longer or,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, what would you have done?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tough question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I would have probably, I would have
probably popped them all, uh, and just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, gotten what we got and then
save, save those, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kept all the keepers and saved them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is an interesting thing I've been
told, which you probably have been told as
[SPEAKER_05]: well is that someone's told me before they
said, I think that the chem dog seeds were
[SPEAKER_05]: a result.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all S1 basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, yeah, but there was that male,
you know, and that kind of ruins that
[SPEAKER_05]: theory.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they were like, yeah,
but no one ever saw that male.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost like that male is like
conveniently inserted into the story so
[SPEAKER_05]: that people wouldn't think they were S1s.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought about that and I thought,
well, I, I see what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like the fact the male was there
does show that they probably weren't S1s,
[SPEAKER_05]: but at the same time, I don't see why G
would lie about them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like what does he have to gain
from that really?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing to gain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he wasn't putting himself and he
killed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't really putting himself in a
good light.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, yeah, I don't that he's telling
the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess what the question really was
was that, um, given that there was males
[SPEAKER_05]: there, what do you speculate the father
was?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I don't believe they're S1s.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess you've kind of said the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really sure what the father is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Tommy would probably know that better
than, better than me being a breeder and
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, yeah, I would, I wouldn't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason I asked that is just because,
um, a lot of people have this,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, thought that the father is what
passes on the potency more so.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, yeah, I'm always interested to
know what the father of things is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think maybe the puck could be
related to the, to the dog, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, some way, uh, kind of always thought
that for very similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, for you, given that you have
been trying all of this, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: high quality weed from back in the early
roots, so to speak, do you think that,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, the modern day hybrids are standing up
to those old favorites or, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: do you still find yourself reminiscing
about the past?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the past, yeah, there's,
there's a few that can stand up to the,
[SPEAKER_01]: to the chems, but, uh, that most of them
just don't, uh, they just don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so do you think that modern hybrids
have mostly improved on flavor and not so
[SPEAKER_05]: much potency per se?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people are out there for
the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, where I've always been for the
potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really care too much what it
tastes like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got, you know, good weed tastes good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they, it just does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that expanding in your lungs and,
uh, coughing and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked, I liked the strong stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I've just, I, I smoke chems and
OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't ever dabble in any glassworks,
do you?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, just, just buy them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, the reason I ask is it's like,
it seems like there's so many people in
[SPEAKER_05]: the chem fam who dabble in, you know,
whether it be, uh, uh, I don't,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure his real name is a weasel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he's also a glassblower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, yeah, he, he, he blows glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he's got some, JJ has a couple of good
pieces from him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, is that, is he the one who did that
fish one for JJ?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's not the fish one.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a guy here in Colorado,
but like old school, just old school
[SPEAKER_01]: pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the other nice work for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, she's, she does great.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does great work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love his style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, I just love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to get, um, one of those like
little mini chillum type things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tommy had one and I was using that and I
was just like, I fell in love with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a cool, the mini hammers are really
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then, you know, his bubblers,
they're all, it's all, all good stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the other thing I'm always
telling people like in Australia,
[SPEAKER_05]: just getting into glass really heavily
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm always telling people like,
cause they say, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm not a glass expert or
anything, but they, they always ask me,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, who should I get my glass from?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, well, there's only one name
I'm going to tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: He makes, I love his colors and,
uh, the millies he puts in on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember Tommy was even saying like,
some of those millies are like quite old
[SPEAKER_05]: and rare even.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like, you truly are getting your
money's worth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the time he puts into them and yeah,
all hand made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a dead 50 piece that he made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the dead shows last year and it's got
like 10 dead millies in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, it's, it's, it's my
favorite piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one if I break, I'd be,
I'd be crying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a few dead ones in mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, I always have to tell them what
they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I think a good way to get back into
this would be, um, you know, like Ken dog
[SPEAKER_05]: is just the, uh, the epitome of Indica,
you know, you really can't get more Indica
[SPEAKER_05]: than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you balance the sativa side out?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I, it's interesting when I was
talking to Mr. Soul, the way he described
[SPEAKER_05]: was chem dog was like, it was that perfect
counterpoint to the really super sativa as
[SPEAKER_05]: he enjoys smoking, you know, it can kind
of bring you back to earth when you've
[SPEAKER_05]: blasted off too hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you view sativas in relation to
chem dog and, or is it just like chem dog
[SPEAKER_05]: feels you need and you don't venture to
that side of the river, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really venture to sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I mean, I think sativas are really
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like daytime, you know, gets you up and
going and good for like at work and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, I've just always liked the,
you know, the, just the knock you dead
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've always, I just wanted to smoke the
pot that gets you the highest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's my personality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sativas really never really did it for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so yeah, I just, I, I just love the,
the potent really strong, strong stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so how do you think the scene would
have progressed if there was never any
[SPEAKER_05]: chem dog?
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like a bit of a weird question,
but I always think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be a sad world out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, uh, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like there, I'd have another
favourite weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out there, I guess, which I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everything kind of everything I like
came from chem.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, that, that's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's an interesting kind of
thought exercise to do with yourself where
[SPEAKER_05]: you think of like all these big names
strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they've got chem in it or it's
suspected, you kind of cross them off the
[SPEAKER_05]: list.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not left with much, are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're not like no gorilla glues out
and you know, sour diesels out and all
[SPEAKER_01]: those really good, good strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just said the special word gorilla
glue.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about it?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've grown it in one, one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of got sick of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but, uh, it was strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a fan of the gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something about the gorilla glue,
which really reminds me of the chem is,
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a, a lot of people love gorilla
glue, but no one really shows that same
[SPEAKER_05]: love to the chem sis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that a lot of the high or the
enjoyment of the high from the gorilla
[SPEAKER_05]: glue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The taste is the chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of chocolatey and smell to me,
but yeah, the high is definitely the
[SPEAKER_01]: sister for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's where it gets its strength.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other interesting thing about the
gorilla glue, which I think it,
[SPEAKER_05]: it definitely has parallels with the chem
dog is that it seems now you're starting
[SPEAKER_05]: to get these fake gorilla glues going
around much like the fake chem dogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you get this situation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was Tommy who said it where
it's like, you know, everyone's had the
[SPEAKER_05]: chem dog, but no one's had the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you feel about that per se?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, do you feel like that's a pretty
accurate reflection?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause yeah, like some people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people, you know,
claim that they have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been smoked it or whatever,
but I think the percentage of that is
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty, it's pretty low.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the night, I know that's the case
on the 91, you know, the four is out there
[SPEAKER_01]: and more available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe is really generous and given that out
to a lot of, a lot of people in those six
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's kind of made its way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, I mean, if we look at both JJ's
and Rez's work, we see that they both
[SPEAKER_05]: chose to work with the Chem D and we know
that you like the Chem D more,
[SPEAKER_05]: but in many ways I find it an interesting
choice because just the, the raw potency
[SPEAKER_05]: of the 91 seems like it would be just an
obvious one to work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you, do you agree with this trade off
they've done, so to speak, where,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the presumption is they've
thought, well, it's not quite as strong,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's got better performance.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got better flavor or maybe better
breeding properties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you, do you agree with that choice they
made or would you have done it
[SPEAKER_05]: differently?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I agree with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the D is so close to potent,
as potent as the 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's close.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think more people like, that have,
that have smoked the real 91 and the D
[SPEAKER_01]: like the D better overall, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's, it's very close to being
as strong as the 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's probably the,
the smell and the, it's, it's a better
[SPEAKER_01]: yielder than the 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: So could be another reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, do you agree with,
I think it was not Skunk himself,
[SPEAKER_05]: but his, his former friend in the story he
told where he was saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: like he feels like there's something about
the Chem Dog where it's like it's tied to
[SPEAKER_05]: the stars where, you know, like it's this
real fickle plant that's hard to master,
[SPEAKER_05]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think that's true or maybe it's
just, we didn't understand plants the way
[SPEAKER_05]: we do now.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you got to have experience growing
the, the chems.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got stuff they like and stuff they
don't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in, and Skunk VA has been growing that
strain for, he's probably the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, number one expert on the,
on the 91 for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I would, you know, whatever he
says, I would, I would believe it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you had to pick the genetics,
which you think would best compliment the
[SPEAKER_05]: 91, I guess, to put it in a realistic
sense, if you had to pick a male,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, which genetics do you think
would compliment the 91 the best?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think I asked Duke and he said
that, yeah, he agreed that the Afghani
[SPEAKER_05]: land race that both JJ and Rez picked was
a good compliment to the D.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you feel about the 91?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with what those guys said.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, not trying to talk
negatively about it, but what are some of
[SPEAKER_05]: the downsides about the chem dogs,
which don't frequently get mentioned?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the flavor was brought up a few
times by a few people, including us.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are some things which people don't
often consider, which you regard?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Chem D can, you know, throw out
Nanners and could variegate and the Chem
[SPEAKER_01]: 91s, you know, not the biggest producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, those things really don't,
you know, the D is probably, that's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably the biggest problem with that one
is thrown out those bananas, but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not really, there's nothing in them and
they don't really, it's not like a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: them unless it gets stressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are probably like the biggest
problems with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: See, it's interesting you bring that up
because a lot of the best strains
[SPEAKER_05]: throughout history have been created from
the 91 throwing pollen on other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as you just mentioned that the nanos
on the D, they're in fertile, so to speak.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, do you find that the 91 is easy to
herm you, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's something I'm always
thinking about, you know, given all these
[SPEAKER_05]: strains originate from it, I would have
thought it was easy to herm.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you find it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think they are all, yeah,
easy to herm for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, I mean, you know, if it's not too
much effort, give us a quick rundown of
[SPEAKER_05]: what your grow style is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do soil or cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just switched over to cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm running Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a friend that works for Botanicare
and he's hooked me up with their whole
[SPEAKER_01]: line, their cocoa, and this run and
everything's, everything's looking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I hand water and just out of a
watering can, I'm very, very, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing special at all, just in my
basement and three lights and enough for
[SPEAKER_01]: me and my wife and some friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it's good and it's all legal,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, very happy with my basement,
my little basement grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my new motto in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause at work, at work, I'm taking care of
a thousand plants and so I come home and
[SPEAKER_01]: take care of 10 and it's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, on that note, what's some
tips for people who are looking to grow
[SPEAKER_05]: large numbers, you know, like you must
have to do things in, you must be looking
[SPEAKER_05]: for shortcuts all the time, given you look
after so many plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's, and we're, we're doing soil
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hand watering everything,
which takes quite a bit of time,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're up close and personal with the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, when you get into big things
like that, you just have to be more just
[SPEAKER_01]: on top of things, preventative and start
when the, you know, the plant's small.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, just make sure it's really,
really healthy to fight off any bugs or
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases or mildew or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just really start from the beginning
and make sure the plant's healthy all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard and in the warehouse,
but staying on top of it, but it just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just a lot of hours and, and,
and hard work and a good team.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you see yourself ever trying to turn
ChemDog into like a full on thing for
[SPEAKER_05]: yourself?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I just remember briefly chatting to
Skunk and he just mentioned that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like he would love to be able to
open like, you know, like the ChemDog
[SPEAKER_05]: Mecca, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that something you would envision
wanting to do?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to be a part of it for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And help in any way I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I'm just kind of focusing on,
you know, my job and, and working at
[SPEAKER_01]: Incredibles and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would love to be involved and help
any of those guys out with whatever I
[SPEAKER_01]: could, whatever I could do.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as I know, you were, or people seem
to tell me that you, you were the first
[SPEAKER_05]: person to kind of get the Skelly back into
the, you know, the, the familiar crew's
[SPEAKER_05]: hands.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was that process of tracking it down
like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my good friend Rob was in Crested
Beauty.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the one that won the, he won the Adam
Dunn Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Came in second place with the Hash Plant
two years ago, and then won it this year
[SPEAKER_01]: with the Chem4.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been holding onto it since 87.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's lived in the same place in Crested
Beauty, so he's able, but he has kept it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, for all these years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Him and a couple other people in Crested
Beauty have been keeping it alive for,
[SPEAKER_01]: since 1987.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, all the credit goes to Rob
and those guys down in Crested Beauty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And have you ever made an attempt to try
to track down the growers of the original
[SPEAKER_05]: dog butt?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or would you think it was just,
it'd just be too hard to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the guy that, I think they're all
probably a lot of old, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot older and, you know, not on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to find them would be hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy that brought it into Crested
Beauty still lives in Crested Beauty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's the one that told my friend that
it came from the Camas Valley in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sure if he's in touch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think he's in touch with,
the people that, you know, he got it from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been 25 years of trying to find
that strand again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, yeah, I haven't found it or
where it came from or what.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe in the future.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're still growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dog butt in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just had his name changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how do you feel about how the public
has received the chem dog?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's, I think I saw an interview
with G in it where he said that he feels
[SPEAKER_05]: over the past few years, the public has
really like warmed to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where in the past people used to really
write it off, but I think just maybe due
[SPEAKER_05]: to exposure, more people have had the real
thing and are like really impressed by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, yeah, if you smoked the real
thing, I think, you know, I think more
[SPEAKER_01]: people have smoked the real thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you smoke the real thing,
it's, you know, you won't forget it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've had so many people tell me in
the last couple of years that it's their
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the best one that they've ever smoked
and never will smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, at certain parts
throughout the history, because obviously
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of people, you know, basically
everyone excluding you and the people
[SPEAKER_05]: directly involved, they're getting a lot
of their information from online.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are periods where, for example,
I think it was around that high times
[SPEAKER_05]: article that they did with G where certain
cuts were just thought not to be around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I think G thought he had lost the 91
and it was just gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: We, whoever in that boat where there were
times when you thought, oh, well,
[SPEAKER_05]: there goes the Chem D forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then like, it turns out you get it
back from a friend of a friend or
[SPEAKER_05]: something, or was it always pretty well
controlled and you never really thought
[SPEAKER_05]: things were gone forever?
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we got them, it's pretty much,
it's pretty controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never been lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that happened, you know,
earlier back in the nineties and early two
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since we've, and my friends have had
it pretty much you know, if you lose it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know someone else, you know,
reliable has it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we got the Chem D back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my Chem D back a couple of years ago
and this guy's had it since we gave it to
[SPEAKER_01]: him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it was six when we first
got it and then got it back from him a few
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and he's, he's kept it and he still
has it and will have it for forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people don't want to lose it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they, they put in a lot of effort in
trying to preserve it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, Tommy mentioned that you can
revitalize clones by vegging them out in
[SPEAKER_05]: the sun for a season and letting them get
really big and then taking some nice
[SPEAKER_05]: clones off them and bringing them inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever seen that done with any of
the Chem Dogs?
[SPEAKER_05]: And if so, did they come out any better
than beforehand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Never seen that done with the Chem Dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always kind of been an indoor venture
the last, since we, since, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: since I've, since I've had them access to
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's always been, yeah, just keeping
them alive indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you could only pick say two of
all the Chem Dogs, which would you want to
[SPEAKER_05]: keep?
[SPEAKER_01]: Two 91 in the D.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it an easy choice?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's, that's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're giving me two choices,
that's easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I get, you know, what's three then?
[SPEAKER_05]: What comes in third?
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it would be four.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be the four.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people wouldn't, wouldn't say
that, but I, I like the four.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the high of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's very medicinal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instant high, taste isn't the best,
but yeah, probably four would be third.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I guess the, the number one is
the D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one is D.
[SPEAKER_01]: 91 close second.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're taking everything like smell,
taste, high, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: D is, D is number one in my book.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that means like, you know,
the only thing you, if you had to pick one
[SPEAKER_05]: strain, you could only have, that would be
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or that's just the favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my island strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my desert island strain Chem D.
[SPEAKER_05]: I might've thought you might've said,
Oh, it's my favorite, but it veg is too
[SPEAKER_05]: slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only thing is that, that,
that banana issue, but we've got it pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much under control.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, if you can, Tommy's got
another, he's got another, another D cut
[SPEAKER_01]: that I got some flowers from the other
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was up there and so I'm going to,
I'm going to grow that one out and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: replace Tommy's with Tommy got this one
from, from G but way, way back when.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you got to see any of
that, but it's, it's, it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't, it doesn't throw out
bananas and it's never variegated on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it may replace, replace that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was the one I tried.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I tried the real one later on,
but I think I kind of like Tommy's one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tommy's is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's the real, it's the real thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: G was telling that he thinks it's the
sister, but there's no way that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's Chem D.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a long time ago and he gave
them that cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mistakes happen, you know, time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you could only change one thing
outside of the banana issue, cause I think
[SPEAKER_05]: that's probably the obvious choice.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could change one thing about the D
and the 91, you know, there could be
[SPEAKER_05]: different things about the cuts,
but what would you change about them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not even like bigger yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, bigger yields is the 91,
if you get a bigger yield, that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did, I've always thought bigger,
it doesn't necessarily mean better,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, my parents live in Maine and you
know, the big fat six, seven pound
[SPEAKER_01]: lobsters don't taste nearly as good as a
two, two and a half pound lobsters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I don't like I'm more of a,
the shoulders on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the buds, like at the shoulders
instead of the tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the 91 not being that big, it really
doesn't, doesn't bother me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I had to pick, yeah, that would be
a bigger, bigger yielders always good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what's the most annoying thing
about trying to talk to people about the
[SPEAKER_05]: chem dog, because I obviously the history
is maybe the obvious one, but like
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes I find it's even just like
people get really lost up in all the names
[SPEAKER_05]: because they've got all the different cuts
and people just lose track of things
[SPEAKER_05]: really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: My probably biggest one is I've been,
I'm a spell guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the D-A-W-G.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's chem dog, it's dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a combination of dog bud,
which is what we got in Crested Butte.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started calling it chem weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think when we saw Mass G and Indian
Apples, like we were calling it chem weed
[SPEAKER_01]: probably, probably Tony was dog budding
chem weed and he just combined the names
[SPEAKER_01]: chem and dog and there you have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's D-O, D-O-G.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not D-A-W-G.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never been D-A-W-G.
[SPEAKER_01]: JJ uses star dog just out of respect for G
and, and that's the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's that, but it's always been D-O-G.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, I mean, do you think in a way,
you know, that by JJ using that naming
[SPEAKER_05]: nomenclature that he's almost,
you know, inadvertently made it a little
[SPEAKER_05]: harder?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of, it's made a little more
confusing, but I think the biggest culprit
[SPEAKER_01]: was another company changed it before JJ
changed actually chem dog D-O-G to
D-A-W-G.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget what company it was, but they,
they kind of started it all.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dog, I mean, that version of dog
really didn't come out until like the
[SPEAKER_01]: later nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there was David Grisman has dog
music D-A-W-G, but that's not what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: referring to.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're referring to like dog,
like the, the urban way of saying dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No chance.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's just smoking chem dog right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've read online that AJ has actually
taken credit for, or at least he's said
[SPEAKER_05]: that at one point in time, he was selling
or giving chem dog to people in New York,
[SPEAKER_05]: but calling it diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, so many people say
that diesel and chem dog are not the same
[SPEAKER_05]: thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause some of the older guys say like,
Oh no, like there is no such thing as
[SPEAKER_05]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually just chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think they just, they changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't, uh, AJ didn't like,
those guys didn't like the name chem,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, associated with it, uh, like chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't like that name.
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought it brought it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, they changed it to diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't know if it was the smell or
the word diesel meant something in New
[SPEAKER_01]: York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but yeah, it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem 91 is the diesel, uh, because when I
got a bag of the diesel, it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, chem 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the sour diesel was more of a,
that was an S one of a chem 91 or
[SPEAKER_01]: something, or I'm not really sure on that
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the whole sour diesel story,
it's kind of been changed a bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, those guys don't have the whole story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they, I'm not really sure they
know what exactly happened, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, it's definitely from the 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's, it, it is,
I mean, the smell is similar, sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little stronger, but, uh, yeah,
I'm not really sure on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, I'm going to spring an idea on
you here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, a lot of people give a lot of credit
to, uh, Oregon and California for helping
[SPEAKER_05]: to kind of, you know, establish the Cal,
the marijuana scene in America.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the more I kind of delve into the
history of things, the more I think New
[SPEAKER_05]: York is like this unsung hero of the
scene, because it's like, it seems like
[SPEAKER_05]: when you trace back a lot of the best
breeders, in my opinion, not, not just the
[SPEAKER_05]: chem dog ones, like obviously all the chem
dog ones, but they trace their roots to
[SPEAKER_05]: New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seems like that environment they
had where people willing to pay for really
[SPEAKER_05]: expensive weed, like bred this environment
where it was like productive to be a
[SPEAKER_05]: breeder and, um, or just even just a
really good grower, you know, have you
[SPEAKER_05]: ever thought about that at all?
[SPEAKER_05]: And do you agree?
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think just the combination of just
people in New York or just go getters,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they just get things done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the market for the weed was,
I mean, just, you know, 6,000 a pound or
[SPEAKER_01]: 7,000 a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it was worth it for those
guys to do what they did and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to make that money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, I think as a combination of
those, those things, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think New York was a good and outdoor
too up in the Ithaca, the finger lakes
[SPEAKER_01]: region and Ithaca college and a lot of,
uh, Cornell and a lot of, uh, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor weed up there for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you ever get to try any of the stuff
that Duke talks about coming out of
[SPEAKER_05]: Virginia or that never really got to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Never really got to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I smoked a lot of living out growing
up outside New York city.
[SPEAKER_01]: We smoked a lot of like, uh, like,
like, you know, pot from blouse and
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghan, Afghani pot and just really
exotic, exotic weed that will come into
[SPEAKER_01]: New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I was pretty spoiled as a,
as a teenager.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And were you smoking weed before the
introductions of Indica's to the scene or
[SPEAKER_05]: were you, they had always been around?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of like right at the,
kind of like right at the beginning when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was smoking, uh, you know, just smoking a
lot of Mexican and Mexican weed and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but yeah, a lot of it started kind of
when I started smoking it, those things
[SPEAKER_01]: started coming on the scene.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting because I've kind of
found anecdotally, um, the people who were
[SPEAKER_05]: around, especially growers before the
advent of like, commercial Indica seeds,
[SPEAKER_05]: like Afghanis, they, you never find one of
them who says Indica's are their
[SPEAKER_05]: favorites, you know, because like they
obviously grew up on sativas.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thought it'd be interesting if you
fell into that category, but the chem dog
[SPEAKER_05]: had won you over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, big time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that in mind throughout,
you know, your whole history of smoking
[SPEAKER_05]: weed, what's been the most enjoyable
terpene or flavor profile for you?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you said you don't really care too
much for flavor, but for a lot of people
[SPEAKER_05]: there's, you know, these really,
kind of exotic terpene profiles from when
[SPEAKER_05]: they were younger because you know,
things were more land racy.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm really into these, uh,
the, the SFV and the TK, uh, the OGs,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, for taste, you know, I really love,
love that taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think the chems get you,
still get you a little higher,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, yeah, I love these, these OG
tastes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, I, I believe the hype,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so how do you think that the laws
affected the scene as it progressed on?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I mean, the immediate assumption
one might make is like, if the laws were
[SPEAKER_05]: more loose, you know, maybe chem dog would
have flourished even more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think that was necessarily the
case?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because at the same time it was still
very, you know, as you said, somewhat
[SPEAKER_05]: close guard, you know, in the right circle
type thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think, uh, back then was
definitely, uh, you know, there wasn't as
[SPEAKER_01]: much trading going on and they were
definitely held closer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the reason I asked that is just
because I kind of think that, um,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was the perfect breeding ground with
the illegal environment in a sense,
[SPEAKER_05]: because it allowed there to be,
you know, if you look at the New York
[SPEAKER_05]: crew, for example, you know, like those
guys who were selling the chem dog for
[SPEAKER_05]: crazy prices in the park, um, you know,
like if it was legal or, or more lax,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like those prices wouldn't have
been there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then maybe, maybe there wouldn't have
been as much incentive to keep the chem
[SPEAKER_05]: dog around because that's part of what I
think has helped keep it around was
[SPEAKER_05]: because it is obviously so valuable in so
many regards.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just ensured its survival.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think just the laws and people,
it being worth so much money and people
[SPEAKER_01]: were, you know, held it closer and
protected it more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would, I would think, I would say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you mentioned earlier that you
generally just grew from clones over the
[SPEAKER_05]: years, but with that in mind, were there
ever any breeders who you kind of thought
[SPEAKER_05]: their work was pretty good?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and bonus points if it's besides JJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, guys from, oh God, what is their
company called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, South fork seeds out in California are
really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got all the real, you know,
chem genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have the real chem genetics,
uh, and you're a good breeder,
[SPEAKER_01]: then, you know, your shit's going to be
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's, uh, on Instagram,
Mr. Bob Hemfield is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to breed now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, he's going to be coming out with
lots of good crosses, cam and puck
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses, uh, JJ, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely check his stuff out
when his, when his comes out, you just got
[SPEAKER_01]: to be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to find someone that has the
real, the real deal, uh, and not just
[SPEAKER_01]: claiming they have it and breeding with it
and just putting out whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's too much of that at the moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so at what point did you really notice
that the chem dog was taking off in the
[SPEAKER_05]: mainstream?
[SPEAKER_05]: And even an extension of that is like,
you know, at what point were you kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: starting to get recognized as the figure
from the story that you are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, probably an IC mag, um, kind of from
then people have just been reading about
[SPEAKER_01]: it for the last, whatever, 10 years or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's just kind of taken,
taken on a life of its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but probably after that, that IC mag,
it started to really, uh, I really only
[SPEAKER_01]: got back into Facebook and Instagram and
all this media stuff a few, a few years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so probably when I went on the Adam
Dunn show is probably when it really,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, kind of really blew up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Adam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you kind of partly answered this
question, but is there, have you met many
[SPEAKER_05]: other people who did, you know,
have claimed they got to experience the
[SPEAKER_05]: dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, they're describing it
correctly to you and it works out the
[SPEAKER_05]: timeframe is about right or not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the dog, but I've never, I've had a
few people over the years telling me that
[SPEAKER_01]: they have it and this, that I've even had
someone send it to me, send a sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, I mean, it was not it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've never known anyone besides myself,
Joe and mass G that have smoked the dog,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I mean, I know there's people out
there, but I have never heard of anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting it back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, I mean, it was just so incredible for
1991.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, this, this pot was just so incredible
for that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had never seen anything like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to this day, 25 years later,
I've never talked to anyone that smoked
[SPEAKER_01]: the real dog blood before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it outdoor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, indoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this, this is just a, this is a bit of
a personal question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking to myself while trying to
91 is how functional do you think someone
[SPEAKER_05]: can be, you know, the average person in
the real world, if they are smoking these
[SPEAKER_05]: chem dogs all day, have you met people who
are still, you know, real go-getters or do
[SPEAKER_05]: you just find it just still takes its toll
on you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's your personality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, uh, if you're a go-getter,
you can, you know, smoke it and no,
[SPEAKER_01]: no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I mean, I smoke it all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm motivated and it's, it helps me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I wouldn't, I wouldn't know what
I'd do without it for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I always like to ask people like,
what are their reasons for, I'm hanging on
[SPEAKER_05]: to cuts, but you know, like specifically
not giving them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you're talking to breeders,
it's somewhat obvious, but one of the
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting topics I had brought up was
that, um, not necessarily like you're
[SPEAKER_05]: looking to keep it out of the hands of the
masses.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the reason I got told was that,
um, you know, people can not look after
[SPEAKER_05]: the plant well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, they take poor clones of
poor clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then eventually, you know,
you've, you've got like, for example,
[SPEAKER_05]: let's say it's the chem dog, you know,
it's like, it's just really degraded and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's, and then, and then it's giving
everyone a poor representation of the chem
[SPEAKER_05]: dog, even when it's done well,
just due to the clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you feel like that has somewhat
happened to the chem dog?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when I heard that re reasoning,
the first thing that popped to my mind was
[SPEAKER_05]: like, that seems like that's kind of what
it's happened with the chem dog in some
[SPEAKER_05]: ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I mean, I've just been told from so
many people that, you know, the biggest
[SPEAKER_05]: reason why clones fade off, so to speak,
is because sometimes, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're not taking the healthiest cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's, you got to take healthy
cuttings starts from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to take them for a nice healthy
mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, uh, it'll just, that plant will
be happy for its life.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you take care of it,
it'll be happy for its life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I think people, I think people,
I don't think that's the reason people
[SPEAKER_01]: kept them close.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people kept them close just
because it was special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they wanted to,
I don't think people thought, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that if I give it to this person,
they're going to degrade the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people just found something
special.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to, they wanted to hold onto
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they got conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone gave it to them and said,
don't give it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think we've only got some short
answer questions left.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are just, you know, more far
away, but what's, uh, what's, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is a two-parter, you know,
what's your least favorite strain?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like the worst strain in your
opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the second part is, you know,
without necessarily giving away the breed
[SPEAKER_05]: out, what's the worst cross you've ever
seen the chem in, you know, because
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously some strains just don't work
when you cross them to others.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you know, genetic.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the worst one you've seen?
[SPEAKER_05]: What does it not agree with?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like fruity strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big fruity guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, you know, any of those purple,
grapey ones or tangerine ones or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, all those, I'm not, I'm not into
those in the chem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the chem crosses I've smoked,
if it's the real chem, it's, I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe chem cross to some fruity purple
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've first, I've seen a couple people
crossing them to some fruity stuff and I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't tried them, but, uh, maybe the
chem will make it strong at least.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The one silver lining.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, what, you know, obviously you've
been around the scene for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's been the worst thing to happen to
it in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_01]: The scene, uh, just, oh God, just some of
the people getting in the, in the business
[SPEAKER_01]: and in it for the wrong reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, just, seeing people 20 years ago
or 15 years ago that would just look at me
[SPEAKER_01]: and thought I was just the biggest piece
of shit, you know, low grade person in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're, you know, now they're all
pro marijuana and it's just kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, people that would look at me
differently 15 years ago and look at me
[SPEAKER_01]: differently now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of what bothers me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most I would think about this
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever had someone, you know,
like try to get back in contact and kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of like getting in with you once they
realized who you are and maybe they had
[SPEAKER_05]: previously written you off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people from high school, uh,
you know, mostly, uh, but they're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: back in touch with me because they know
they have a sick, you know, relative or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, they're looking for answers,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, happy to help them out,
but no, they're not, they're not looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for strains and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I get people asking me for the chems
all the time and I just have to just say
[SPEAKER_01]: no all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, yeah, that's kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what do you think is like a big
mistake people make when they're growing
[SPEAKER_05]: the chem dog?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because for me, it's, you know,
a lot of people say it's so finicky.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, what, what's something about
it that it likes that it, or something it
[SPEAKER_05]: doesn't like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: like chem 91 doesn't like a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually put them kind of on that
outskirts of the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to do a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but if you're, you know, follow your,
your, you know, for program and 10 to 11
[SPEAKER_01]: care, they play like a lot of cow mag,
you know, D likes cow bag up until,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, week seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so just a couple of things like that,
but it's, it's, it's not very hard plant
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, I've, I've thought about the
scene that the Grateful Dead created and
[SPEAKER_05]: it seems like, you know, it was like that
perfect storm for progressing the scene.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think that trying to create
something similar to that in a modern
[SPEAKER_05]: sense would work out, or you think just
the, the climate is too different and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: just, yeah, it's not, it wouldn't work in
the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's just different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people are just more out in the
open and, uh, trading things just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you can buy cuts on Craigslist
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so it's just, it's a different time we
live in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I don't think it would,
I think it was just a, just that time that
[SPEAKER_01]: we were in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, well, do you think that given
like so much of the masses are now newly
[SPEAKER_05]: jumping into cannabis cultivation,
at least in America, um, do you think that
[SPEAKER_05]: that could be harmful anyway?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it seems like there's a lot of
growers who don't necessarily know how to
[SPEAKER_05]: deal with a lot of problems that could
have flow on effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, the cloning one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think, uh, yeah, the cloning one's
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, for sure, uh,
you know, get more people and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, but yeah, I, I definitely problems for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more people grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how do you feel about what's,
you know, widely regarded as somewhat over
[SPEAKER_05]: the top, uh, rules in, you know,
you might not be fully involved in it,
[SPEAKER_05]: but, um, you know, in the Oregon,
I believe it is, I've got, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: some pretty insane testing requirements.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you feel about those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Testing is, um, I'm kind of up in the,
up in the air and testing until they,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, have like a standardized test,
I guess, uh, like a, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: machine that's, this is the way it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're kind of different
machines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I really don't, you know,
the testing, I don't really believe in the
[SPEAKER_01]: testing too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have, you know, 27% THC
crystals on your, uh, whatever flow bud
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, you have in the chem tests
at 20% or 18%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the chem crystals, the makeup of
those 18% are better than the,
[SPEAKER_01]: than the, you know, the 27% on the,
on the other, but I think the crystals,
[SPEAKER_01]: the makeup of those, the crystals are
stronger and better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't, you know, so a 17 could get
you higher than a 27.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, what do you think,
you know, it's obviously probably going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be a guess, but if, if you did have to
guess, what do you think that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the average sample of well-grown
Chem 91 does sit at?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, like if that is the
strongest weed, then we shouldn't,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and it's not testing high,
then, you know, who cares about numbers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that 91 and the four and
those, they all, they test like mid
[SPEAKER_01]: twenties, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so it's never, you know, like 30% or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but yet they're the strongest,
strongest, uh, strains that I've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I'm not a big believer in
testing yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so our final question, um,
if you could go back to any time and get
[SPEAKER_05]: any seeds from anywhere, whether it be,
you know, seeds you could buy from early
[SPEAKER_05]: in the day or just land race seeds and,
you know, you're, you're allowed to just
[SPEAKER_05]: obtain them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, what would it be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I think I would have to go back to
1991 and, uh, take that ounce from,
[SPEAKER_01]: from G and, uh, take those 13 seeds from
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I, I, you know, I, uh, you know,
those, those are, those are special seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but like a nice, you know,
a nice African land race strain seeds from
[SPEAKER_01]: Africa would be nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, go back to, go back to Amsterdam in
the seventies or, you know, early eighties
[SPEAKER_01]: and see what they had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, get some of that old sensey seed stock
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think I'd go after this 13 seeds
that G found.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to bite you into the skelly
seeds, but you gave a better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you tried, um, JJ's Nigerian?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's one of the better sativa's
I like kind of reminds me of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like all that weed I was used to get in
high school from different countries and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Nigerian is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just thought maybe that was where the,
uh, the African comment came from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, I think that brings us to the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks so much for coming on P bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any questions or shout outs you
wanted to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just shout out to Incredibles and,
uh, everyone, everyone down there,
[SPEAKER_01]: a great company to work for, go out and
get some bars and pretty much every
[SPEAKER_01]: dispenser in Colorado, I think Incredibles
is in, uh, and shout out to, to Matt,
[SPEAKER_01]: to, to G, uh, for, you know, doing what he
did with those seeds and, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my good buddy, Joe Brand, shout out to
him if he's going to be listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss you buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, yeah, that's about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my wife.
