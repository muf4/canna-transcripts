[SPEAKER_00]: On this episode, we're joined by our
second friend from the final frontier,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jaime Chiba, the man behind Alaskan
Cannabis Seed Cache, a seed preserver and
[SPEAKER_00]: historian in his own right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's come on the show today to tell us
about some of his breedings, some plans
[SPEAKER_00]: for the future, and talk about some RKS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, friends, we're back for another
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on this episode, we're joined by the
old school head and founder of Alaskan
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Cache, Jaime Chiba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I'd love to start the show by
asking our guests, what have you been
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking on recently?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's actually one of the strains I was
going to ask you about, not just because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's sort of in your repertoire,
but I'd actually dug up some posts on
[SPEAKER_00]: various forums where people were like,
you know, talking about how much they
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that mean that it's sort of South
African genetics is what it's made up of?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back then, there wasn't, you know,
everything was in seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no clones or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So pretty much the seeds in someone's
pocket is what ended up being some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff that was, you know, grown here in
Alaska and California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so would you describe that as sort of
like a more uplifting effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, what's the flavors on it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's it's got a really heavy,
ripe strawberry turp to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real heavy anise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anise is another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, kind of leads me to think
that there might be a few more strains in
[SPEAKER_03]: there than than I thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be a wild hybrid, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of that was going on and it was
Rhodesia at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it's hard to say because the
breeder, the original breeder,
[SPEAKER_03]: I never met him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met the people that inherited the
strain, and then I just kept it going.
[SPEAKER_03]: My first job as a pot grower was to pack
water for mudbite delight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you know, you referenced the
anise flavor in there, and that's one that
[SPEAKER_00]: commonly gets thrown around as like the
typical description for a Durban.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see some overlap there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it has.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I want to say it has Durban in
it, most definitely, and then some heavy
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghani presence in there also.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a great daytime smoke,
keeps you motivated doing things,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's got a good stone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you got aches and pains and you're
old like I am, it helps, helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had noticed while scrolling through your
Instagram that obviously a wide variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: different strains, but a lot of them sort
of fell under the general umbrella of
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was sort of wondering, are you like
me in that you would say sort of generally
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking, you're a fan of the Afghanis?
[SPEAKER_03]: I am, but I'm also a fan of Sativas.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you say breeder, I'm more of a
preservationist.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I call myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, some people have called me the
crazy seed collector.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people came to my home over the
years, and the few people that I showed
[SPEAKER_03]: what I had going on thought I was,
you know, insane for just growing weed
[SPEAKER_03]: with seeds in it and preserving strains
instead of selling weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that was the thing, and that's
what everybody did during my era.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, kind of this is validation
to an old crazy guy after all these years
[SPEAKER_03]: of having seeded plants and trying to
explain it to good friends and people that
[SPEAKER_03]: I meet in the industry over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit different now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, as far as the breeding goes,
I took what came to me and I crossed it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I did a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the work that you put in that
makes you a breeder and the testing and
[SPEAKER_03]: sending it out there and getting results
from other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That, in that sense, I think makes you a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I call myself a breeder only because I do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have everything tested by other people
and I accept whatever they have to say
[SPEAKER_03]: about whatever I put out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll either release something or I
won't, depending on what they give me,
[SPEAKER_03]: what they're feedback is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny because like, as you were
saying that in my mind, I'm like ticking
[SPEAKER_00]: these boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yep, that, that checks out,
that checks out, that checks out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end of it, I'm like,
wait, you just described like what being a
[SPEAKER_00]: good breeder is really.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, like I said before,
my currency is time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything I do just to bring something to
an F5 will take me six to seven years.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I've worked with a lot of
different strains and brought them up to
[SPEAKER_03]: that point, but I haven't released a lot
because it's been so much work to just set
[SPEAKER_03]: it out there and have somebody grab it up
and call it something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of would break my heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a collector thing,
I guess, or part of my mental illness of
[SPEAKER_03]: collecting seeds and working with strains
for over these years, not, not giving them
[SPEAKER_03]: away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might call me a hoarder.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people called me a hoarder when I
wouldn't release a roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's basically what prompted me to
release it, that being called greedy and
[SPEAKER_03]: selfish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm none of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just that I could have released a
stable version or an IBL.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought, you know, the IBL that
would release the whole genome to
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody so they can work with it and
find what they want in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's been a myriad of things,
but there is no floral accents like a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of people are finding in some skunks.
[SPEAKER_03]: The roadkill originally had none of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's what it was originally
called.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was originally called roadkill,
not roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: That came, that came about in the late
eighties, early nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: People started calling it RK.
[SPEAKER_03]: S and roadkill skunk when I started
selling clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of, a lot of like sort of notable
points to touch on in that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to loop back to a few of them
before we jump into the roadkill skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to quickly ask in the prior
question you referenced, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you were hanging onto all these seeds
all through the eighties and nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering, did you have the foresight
back then to know that like at some point
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future, these seeds would be
valuable or was it more different?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just like, I just want to
retain my own seeds, really.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it started out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in my travels, I traveled
extensively.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met a few people that were doing the
same thing as me, but they seemed as crazy
[SPEAKER_03]: as I was and got the same feedback.
[SPEAKER_03]: What really spurred me on and the part
that most people don't understand because
[SPEAKER_03]: it was illegal, there was a lot of people
that would lose their strains because a
[SPEAKER_03]: girlfriend would turn them in or they were
stupid or they let somebody in or they
[SPEAKER_03]: just plain got busted door got kicked in
and they lost their strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I started to think, well,
if, if I'm going to keep doing this,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, to, to collect more and to get more,
I can guarantee people that have a
[SPEAKER_03]: saleable product that they're,
they're making money on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out there selling every day, uh,
bags to the public.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I take their strain and I save it,
then, um, I have those genetics that they
[SPEAKER_03]: want to start over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have those in seed form.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it was clones, but I prefer not
to work with clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to keep them alive over a long
period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've kept some clones alive most longer
than I ever should have, but, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a lot more work than breeding or
working with seeds, uh, stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the toughest thing for me was the,
uh, retention of males, uh, trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: keep, um, I have a pretty extensive seed
stock and trying to keep all these things
[SPEAKER_03]: alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I regenerate them every three years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So every three years, I'll, I'll regrow as
much as I can in a rotating basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So nothing gets older than three years and
doesn't lose its viability for
[SPEAKER_03]: germination.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's, uh, you know, a lot of people
don't do that, but that's the only way if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to make sure that somebody
gets the product that they want or they
[SPEAKER_03]: were working with before that they have a
reasonable, uh, experience in,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, growing it out, germinating it and,
and getting what they had before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what you just referenced there
with strains being lost is a plight felt
[SPEAKER_00]: by most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most breeders, I think most people who've
come on the show can talk of a few strains
[SPEAKER_00]: they've regrettably lost over the years
that they wish they still had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to quickly ask though,
you mentioned, you know, um, breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: things over multiple generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be interested to know from your
perspective, let's use the roadkill skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, cause I'm sure we'll talk
about it a bunch throughout the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think you've got it at the F5
or maybe even a little further at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you sort of noticed change over
the generations as you've worked with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you been able to narrow things a bit,
or are you trying to open it up?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to open it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I, what I find, what has really
happened with it, it's lost its heavy
[SPEAKER_03]: stone effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's a more of a, um, a happier stone.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people are enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does have that old, uh, old school,
uh, effect, but it doesn't have the
[SPEAKER_03]: original heavy stone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, when I first sourced it, uh,
when I sourced it in, uh, in, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: Albion area of Mendocino, um, from some
old hippie couple and their commune,
[SPEAKER_03]: like people that was growing outdoors in
our, in, in that region.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, in California, they had what are
called planning holes and you dig a hole
[SPEAKER_03]: in this clay soil is a dense clay soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'd add soil or amended soil to
that, that you made your own soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you grow your plants in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in that region, uh, there's a pH
problem or alkalinity problem that stunts
[SPEAKER_03]: the trees and natural growth of,
of the bushes and plants around there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, one of the things I recommend to
people with roadkill is that you adjust
[SPEAKER_03]: your pH downwards, um, to, to bring out
the heavier scent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed the furthest further you get
away, um, with your pH.
[SPEAKER_03]: The higher you go with it, the,
uh, the less it stinks.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it makes sense, you know,
sort of using the known terroir effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be interested to know, have you ever
feel around with adding or subtracting
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfur from the soil and seeing,
cause a lot of people always throw out the
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of like roadkill skunk maybe has like
some file, some sulfur type compounds in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I, a lot of people use sulfur,
uh, up here, you know, we, we,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, we really don't have issues where we
require sulfur.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so I never, uh, experimented too much
with sulfur at all, but I have heard that
[SPEAKER_03]: I have heard about the thiols,
um, you know, without having DNA testing
[SPEAKER_03]: or, you know, genetic testing on things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it, it's hard to say exactly what's in
there that creates the stench,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the, the plant, when it's,
when it was growing in its prime,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, you, the place that I, I sourced it
from was, uh, up river about, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: three quarters of a mile.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could actually smell part of the grow
from one or highway one on the coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you had, you had, uh, ocean air blowing
in, but you could still down river smell
[SPEAKER_03]: the smell of, of that grow, that
particular grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of the first ones on the river.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do you think that the reason why we
don't see it anymore is because it just
[SPEAKER_00]: was, as people sort of say, people just
got busted with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's the reason I stopped
making clones available.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there was just too many people getting
busted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, uh, really good people that,
that, that I know really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and with, uh, I don't know if you had
it going on over there in Australia,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they were taking everything you had
under federal forfeiture laws and police
[SPEAKER_03]: departments were getting rich and,
and good folks that, uh, the only thing
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you know, they were doing was,
you know, selling marijuana for,
[SPEAKER_03]: for a living.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they were, they were getting,
uh, busted and losing everything they had
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes their children.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those stories, uh, you know,
they're, they're too horrible to listen to
[SPEAKER_03]: for, for a plant that, you know,
you had a part in making sure it got
[SPEAKER_03]: distributed widely.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's downfall really was that
it's a medium yielder at best.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when big bud came in BC big bud,
it kind of stole the show that in the
[SPEAKER_03]: widows and the whites kind of stole the
show as, as, as a, a commercial grow,
[SPEAKER_03]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, uh, a lot of what I did as far
as, uh, unknown strains, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: say, well, what's the name of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, sometimes I've got a strain that's
just called Bob strains, but it's
[SPEAKER_03]: completely a knockout strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, I don't know the background
of the strain because when I got it from
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob, he didn't know, you know,
it might've been bag seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't know its origins, but it made
him a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I preserved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when, you know, especially around
here where people got used to smoking it
[SPEAKER_03]: for years, I would let it back out and,
uh, they're like, oh yeah, what's,
[SPEAKER_03]: what's the genetics on this?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, your guess is as good as mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on that end, like I say, being a
preservationist and a breeder,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, are two separate things.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm preserving something, I want to
preserve something as close to the
[SPEAKER_03]: original as possible, especially in those
instances in seed form.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I could get that, um, person that lost
everything up and running again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, that's a very sort of noble
cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can definitely jive with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, while we're on the topic of
talking about the genetics in a strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the tales you hear about the
roadkill skunk, and I think you'd be the
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect person to ask that it sort of
originally had its roots in, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the bikey scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you believe there's any truth to that
given you just said, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you actually got it from a hippie
community?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, to be honest with you, I went,
I used to go to, um, Garberville,
[SPEAKER_03]: California to the Redwood run.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a biker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, when I'd go to Garberville to the
Redwood run, they'd have all these
[SPEAKER_03]: different rock and roll shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so, uh, hooked up with a lot of
regional, uh, Humboldt area breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just came across this hippie couple
that came up to see one of the shows and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, they offered to show me their grow
and, uh, hook me up with some stuff I
[SPEAKER_03]: could bring back to Alaska to share with
everybody here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one of the things I did when
traveling, uh, I smuggled a lot of weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: Hawaii, California, Kentucky, Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, a lot of it, uh, you know,
I bring it back here and, and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, friends would, uh, go ahead and get
rid of me, get rid of it for me because I
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't sell weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem with me selling weed is I
didn't sell weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem with me selling weed is,
is if I got busted, I didn't just lose my
[SPEAKER_03]: seed stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost everybody's seed stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I tried to be at, you know,
as careful as I could with, with,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, what I was entrusted with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, some of those people are gone
today and I asked their relatives to this
[SPEAKER_03]: day, you know, can I go ahead and,
and, you know, reuse this strain?
[SPEAKER_03]: This used to be your uncle's or your,
or your father's or your grandfather's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, can I reintroduce this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a problem with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And most, almost none of them have.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did notice in California, there was
really no interest in seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, when I tried to reintroduce them years
ago, I went to the Redwood Run for,
[SPEAKER_03]: for almost 40 years and, uh, tried to
reintroduce, uh, some of the seed stock or
[SPEAKER_03]: just give them back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, here's these genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got these from your grandpa,
your father, aunt, uncle, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just weren't interested.
[SPEAKER_03]: They say, Hey dude, we do everything from
established clones here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know what works here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, okay, I'm just telling you,
I got the seed stock from your,
[SPEAKER_03]: your folks and I've kept it all these
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want it's yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, nah, hang on to it's
yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's probably a lot of people
who are like wishing they could have
[SPEAKER_00]: traded places that like, you know,
kudos to you for, for restraining yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: in that conversation and just being able
to be like, well, you don't know what you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you know, it, it's sad because there,
there is a lot of stuff that got lost
[SPEAKER_03]: because I can only collect so much myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I know what I liked and what my
friends liked.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we all have our group that,
that we have our sessions with that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that we enjoy cannabis with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have, uh, another extension of
people that we give a pot to or share
[SPEAKER_03]: away.
[SPEAKER_03]: With because they have ailments or certain
things going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, to lose some of those things that
are, that have been out there for four
[SPEAKER_03]: years, I think was, you know, the biggest
crime that was committed, uh, during the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole pot prohibition was losing all those
things that could have been beneficial.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, all pot is medicinal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tell everybody that if it makes you feel
good, that's medicinal.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it changes your mindset, that's
medicinal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just my personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I can, I can greatly get on board with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really interesting to hear that
just to quickly loop back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd mentioned a few other states you'd
been to and brought some cannabis back
[SPEAKER_00]: from over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever get a chance to see the fab
would, cause you mentioned Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was wondering, did you see Kentucky
bluegrass, which is a somewhat well-known
[SPEAKER_00]: strain at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, under that name, I couldn't tell
you, but I probably have.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my, in my, uh, in my bank, probably
about eight strains left from Kentucky,
[SPEAKER_03]: older strains, a lot of it's red hair and
stinky, uh, you know, a lot of skunks,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, that, that don't exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of those folks, I, I can't get in
touch with, uh, I haven't, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what happened to them over
the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some things I'm reluctant to release,
uh, simply because I don't know how it'll
[SPEAKER_03]: affect, uh, people that might still be
growing out and, and their ability to
[SPEAKER_03]: regenerate it, which is what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I regenerate things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I do the best I can with what I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so it doesn't get lost, but I
regenerate the seeds and, and try and keep
[SPEAKER_03]: them viable.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in that process, you know,
I can't, I'm not perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, some things can get lost with
parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you're a breeder and you
don't choose or select the exact,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, you know, or as close to what you're
looking for in the plant that everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: loves, you can inadvertently change it
without trying to do so.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, you know, challenge any breeder to
keep 10 strains for one year and try not
[SPEAKER_03]: to, try not to change anything about them
from the original donors, both parents,
[SPEAKER_03]: both, you know, your original,
uh, parent lineage.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, it's a task.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so like I said, uh, my currency
is time more than anything and karma,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, if you don't keep a good karma
while you're doing all this, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: what I've seen, uh, when, especially when
it's associated with all about the money
[SPEAKER_03]: that bad things seem to happen and bad
things happen to good people in those
[SPEAKER_03]: situations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got to keep a clear head and,
uh, you know, just be practical,
[SPEAKER_03]: just be a farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some really wise words there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can definitely get on board with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep track of the karma meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to quickly run this idea by
you, um, because we hear it a lot in the
[SPEAKER_00]: community as a general sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you believe that there was only ever
one roadkill skunk, or do you think it was
[SPEAKER_00]: a profile that actually occurred in maybe
a few different strains and people are
[SPEAKER_00]: just noticing that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there could be a myriad of,
of roadkills.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it with in, uh, with what I've
released as an IBL.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's, I'm down to seven,
um, um, male plants now that I use for
[SPEAKER_03]: open pollination.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, the last time I did, I had 11,
uh, but I had went through a series of the
[SPEAKER_03]: last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't so kind to me as far as,
uh, illnesses and health.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so, um, during that time, uh,
my help, I had to have help for a long
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, my, my health, came and went.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in that process, I lost some,
uh, some male donor plants, parent plants
[SPEAKER_03]: for the IBL.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, so I had to create new ones out
of seed stock that I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's changed a bit even doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I said, challenge anybody to
try and keep the original stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: All you can do is do the best you can with
what you're given.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's probably, if somebody has
a large enough facility and they run
[SPEAKER_03]: enough, uh, phenos, they, they can keep
and preserve exact replicas, especially
[SPEAKER_03]: doing tissue, tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not much of a feminized guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to do rotolization, which is when
the plant gets older, it'll, it'll self
[SPEAKER_03]: germinate itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was a big believer in that and
trying to preserve an original mother
[SPEAKER_03]: plant that I may have been losing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just let her go to flower, let her
rotolize and let her, uh, self-pollinate
[SPEAKER_03]: and basically an S1 just to keep that gene
pool intact.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I'm no scientist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just do the best I can with what I've
learned over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people, when they start talking,
uh, pot or breeding or preserving strains,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, with me, they get kind of,
uh, I go over their head a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mean to, it's just, this has been
my passion for, um, you know, as long as
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I was a teenager, this is what I
did.
[SPEAKER_03]: My first job was with, uh, Matanuska,
uh, Thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took an ad in the paper to go clean
some, uh, some buses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know what it entailed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met this old biker dude and he said,
uh, now I'm raising Hawaiian fighting dogs
[SPEAKER_03]: and these buses back here, but I got
something else going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you keep your mouth shut?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, I'll pay you well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have to promise me you'll keep
your mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, okay, no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: What he wanted done was I had to clean dog
shit out of this school bus that he raised
[SPEAKER_03]: these Hawaiian fighting dogs in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other buses had Matanuska
Thunderfuck in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had to, uh, keep those, uh,
plants going and call any males and in the
[SPEAKER_03]: smaller plants as they were showing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he showed me all of that and,
uh, that was a summer job for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after a while, he got to trust me so
much that, uh, I was able to get original
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics from him too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a, what an introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that your first sort of, um,
hands-on experience with growing?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my first hands-on experience
with, uh, yeah, just even working with a
[SPEAKER_03]: pot plant, uh, knowing what was going on
with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I didn't, I didn't know I was going to
go be cleaning, uh, school buses with dog
[SPEAKER_03]: shit and, and, uh, pot plants in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, yeah, it was, uh, it was,
uh, a real, uh, education.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he was up in Anchorage and I was up
there for the summer with, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: with my father when I was younger.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I needed a job during the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: My dad said, go get a job.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went and got a job.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, of course, I didn't tell him
what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kept your word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally kept my word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned a lot from that old biker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, there's so many questions to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me a bit about the Matanuska
Thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those ones where like everyone
knows the name and has heard of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's hard to get clear descriptions
about like the smells, the flavors,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the overall effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, it's a good stone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, um, a heady stone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, gets you, uh, you know, in the place
you want to be, uh, not debilitating,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, has a lot of, uh, painkilling and,
uh, you know, let you sleep fairly easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, I want to say that there has to be a
certain extent of, uh, uh, Afghani and the
[SPEAKER_03]: original, uh, crosses that I was working
with, but mostly Sativa, I would say it
[SPEAKER_03]: was, uh, um, probably a 60, 40 on the
Sativa side, but without having genetics
[SPEAKER_03]: or testing, I couldn't tell you exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then looking at the plants,
um, they would throw sometimes narrowly,
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes wide leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see the mix in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a true hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, back in the day when, um, when I was
working with this plant, I actually talked
[SPEAKER_03]: the guy in to let me, uh, make seeds
because he believed if he was going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant to someone else, so they could,
uh, they could grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did something called grafting and he
would, he would take a, a, another plant
[SPEAKER_03]: and graft on the Matanuska Thunderfuck and
get it to this other guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you would think that those
genetics would somehow mix in that plan or
[SPEAKER_03]: something, but that's how he liked to do
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He cut a little notch in the, in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: He, he notched both plants and then would
wrap it up with some pulse test that he
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't share with me and then bandage it
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he'd have me set them off to the
side and, and I would take care of these
[SPEAKER_03]: things until they were ready to,
uh, to go to one of his pals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it was a way for him to get the actual
plant to someone else that was going to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow it to, for commercial value.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were all bikers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and so, you know, I, like I said,
I kept my mouth shut pretty much up until
[SPEAKER_03]: now and I still kept my, keep my mouth
shut about names and who they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, in, in this game forever,
um, name dropping was a no-no.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just, you just didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, so that's, that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still do that to this day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's a lot of people that get upset
about me because they want to know who
[SPEAKER_03]: original breeder was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially if it's a biker or a club
biker, I'm never throwing that name out
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm never throwing that affiliation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's nobody's business by my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, running with that thread,
one of the sort of general lines of
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion you hear in the cannabis
community is that many of the old school
[SPEAKER_00]: clones that are now sort of fabled did
have their roots in the biker scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were the bikies sort of reasonably
involved in the cannabis scene over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, with, with, uh, with,
uh, clubs, you have the ability to have a
[SPEAKER_03]: clubhouse and, and, uh, you know,
you're protecting your clubhouse and you
[SPEAKER_03]: have, uh, basically a sanctuary where
you're not letting the general public in
[SPEAKER_03]: anyway, or, uh, law enforcement usually
has to get a warrant to, to blow the doors
[SPEAKER_03]: down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, um, you know, that system of being
able to, um, move things around,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, clandestine, and, uh, closed mouth
people, uh, yeah, a lot of genetics,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, stayed viable and around because of,
uh, what was available within that,
[SPEAKER_03]: with the, in that system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise they, they wouldn't,
you know, um, it's just mainly a culture
[SPEAKER_03]: within a culture, you know, that you have
the counter culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then you had us bikers,
you know, I, I never called myself a
[SPEAKER_03]: hippie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was always, I was impressed by,
you know, I still think to this day,
[SPEAKER_03]: every time I look at what's going on
today, I go, yep, the hippies were right
[SPEAKER_03]: again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could never be one, but I really
respected, um, their, their attitude and
[SPEAKER_03]: what they did and, and, uh, their
resolution to everything, peace of love
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and, and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, uh, that wasn't me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't live in that world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of kept to myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need people from all sorts of
different corners to ultimately be
[SPEAKER_00]: represented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump back into some of the RKS
stuff, because I know that a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: are keen to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we may as well bash out some of the
sort of, uh, more pressing questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that are on people's minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairly recently on the show, we had,
uh, Todd McCormick come on as a great
[SPEAKER_00]: episode and he, uh, spoke about his
friendship with you and some of the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: he'd got off you and he vouched for your
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, Hey, the RKS time he's got,
it's real deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, you just, you might have to hunt
through a few seeds to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he said that you, you could probably
refine it to be a little more louder,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was definitely there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that how you would describe it to
someone who comes to you and says,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I want to find, you know,
that nostril flaring roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, that's a big, big
controversy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, uh, when I originally agreed to
release it, uh, Todd was one of the people
[SPEAKER_03]: that I always respected for his sacrifice
and his dedication to his plan over the
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I, I reluctantly released the IBL
because I thought that would release a
[SPEAKER_03]: wider variety for somebody to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet the inside of the IBL, there's
definitely the heavy stinkers all the way
[SPEAKER_03]: down to, um, you know, some people have
reported, uh, not having, uh, the heavy
[SPEAKER_03]: scent or any skunk scent at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, sometimes I've replaced those because
I knew the people and I knew they weren't
[SPEAKER_03]: BSing me, but you're going to find that
with phenos that across the board,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially when you're using 11 male
donors and I, I never work with less than
[SPEAKER_03]: 130 female plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, yeah, it's, it, it's hard to,
uh, pin it down, but I, I pinned it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, I, I told Todd,
if I released, you know, the absolute
[SPEAKER_03]: stinker, you know, what kind of price
point do you put on something like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you can only release it once and
then everybody's knocking it off
[SPEAKER_03]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and then they're calling it something
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I put in, uh, 15 years of work on
getting up to where it's at right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do I just want to just throw it out
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, um, you know, and everybody said it
was too expensive to begin with,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, what I originally set it out there and
Todd took it, F2 it, and then released it,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, and, you know, drop the price down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was more readily available.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a big guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just, uh, holding onto genetics and,
and, uh, doing the best I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be honest with you, I told you,
um, how I made a living at it was backing
[SPEAKER_03]: up growers and, uh, other people that were
saying they were breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would sell them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I would go to shows and bring them,
uh, six or seven different strains that
[SPEAKER_03]: they're getting directly from me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I say, my business and,
and the people that I hung out with,
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't name drop, you know,
uh, so I always believed in open source
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, uh, cause that anything less,
I'd just be a hypocrite.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I live my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would get these, uh, genetics and
sometimes for nothing, just to preserve
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for me not to share them or,
you know, um, I'm not trying to,
[SPEAKER_03]: to get rich or, or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I just don't want to give something
away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have grandchildren that I hope that
someday that maybe they'll pick this up
[SPEAKER_03]: and run with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it's a fully legal and there is no
worries like there is today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, globally, it still hasn't been
resolved in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and, and a lot of people are left
hanging because of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, if it ever gets back to
how it was, I mean, that's going to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: total tragedy, but I could see it moving
that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: If governments aren't making the kind of
money that they want to make off of it,
[SPEAKER_03]: those days are gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I tell most of my friends,
those days of making all that money and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, uh, living the lifestyle that you
were, they're gone for good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But fortunately, a lot of the strains
aren't because there's a few crazy guys
[SPEAKER_03]: like myself have hung onto things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's so interesting that you touch
on that topic about like those days are
[SPEAKER_00]: gone because I, I feel like I have that
conversation with people more and more,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you hear people talking about
how producers who used to produce the best
[SPEAKER_00]: quality herb are getting out of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always just say like, yeah,
yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can't make like the 30 K off your
crop every three months anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like that, but you know,
you look at other farmers, they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: making any win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, someone growing corn or
whatever, like they don't grow that sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like there's this sort of
underlying entitlement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to explain, look like,
yeah, the reason why you got paid that in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past was because of the very real
threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to a large degree, you know,
there's less threat depending on where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they don't seem to be seem to
understand that like, that's where that
[SPEAKER_00]: price was coming from was from the threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and now that that's gone, that's the
price is dropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say that over time, cannabis
will become like corn in the sense that
[SPEAKER_00]: like, it'll just become like an everyday
farmer sort of income?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and the people that continue on,
uh, will do it for the love of farming and
[SPEAKER_03]: for the love of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and you know, the culture and the,
and the mystique that went behind this
[SPEAKER_03]: plant, uh, for all these ages.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, um, I saw all this stuff from the
sixties, seventies, eighties, nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, now we're up into two thousands and
I'm still seeing stuff every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you keep your eyes open and you
appreciate things for what they are,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, you don't miss every, cause just
myself, I, I can only keep so much alive,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, and preserve that that I loved and my
friends loved and, and, uh, some friends
[SPEAKER_03]: profited from, um, but there's,
you know, there's no way that any one
[SPEAKER_03]: person can, can keep a lot of things
together for a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I'm slowly learning that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I lose stuff every day just
because I can't do what I used to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to do up to 1200 plants in
rotation, you know, every, every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, three different cycles and,
and try and keep the seeds regenerated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were somebody wanted them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were viable.
[SPEAKER_03]: They germinated right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they were good, strong genetics and
they were as close to or equal to what
[SPEAKER_03]: people remember them being.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, like I said, without, uh,
DNA testing or, or, um, actual genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: testing, it's hard to say, you know,
um, when you're getting from different
[SPEAKER_03]: sources, I try to source things myself
from the regions I go to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for years, that was my vacation,
go somewhere and, and, uh, and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was my job to get strains from,
you know, some people would go to the bar
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and after work, I'd go look for
cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you know, you get, you get them
from the strangest, uh, uh, sources.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes some of the best people that
you ever want to meet you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got in some really scary, crazy
situations, even for me being a biker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I can tell you a lot of times I'm
like, man, is this guy going to kill me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you know, I, a pig farmer comes to
mind, you know, and, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: he talks some crazy stuff, but man,
he had the best weed in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, you know, that I'd seen to that
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I just wanted that strain that he
had.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, to, uh, to get it,
I had to put myself in a situation that I
[SPEAKER_03]: probably wouldn't do today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mean to ramble on, but it's,
it's been a long, strange trip and they
[SPEAKER_03]: had dead shows were really good for them,
a dead head.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, those shows were, were a blast
that thanks to the hippies and dead heads
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I, I wasn't much of a dancer and
standing in the middle of 30,000 people
[SPEAKER_03]: jumping up and down and dancing is a real
experience that, you know, I wish
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody could experience because it,
it does change your heart as a person.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was pretty callous after coming out of
the military and, and, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot different person than I am today.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a lot harder biker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but, you know, cannabis and,
uh, dead heads pretty much changed my life
[SPEAKER_03]: for me for the positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sort of echoing the sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost every guest on the show has said,
I think that's probably one of the most,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, unknown things to the general public
is how much of a contribution the Grateful
[SPEAKER_00]: Dead played to cannabis over the past 40
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A shakedown street.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could get everything, anything you
wanted on shakedown street.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, a lot of people, you know,
my alias, I'm Ichiba.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people knew my alias is that
crazy guy that's looking for seeds and is
[SPEAKER_03]: willing to pay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got scammed a lot, but I got some
great genetics, uh, on shakedown street
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we link back to sort of some of the
details of the answers you've given
[SPEAKER_00]: already, you talk about how you've had
quite decent plant numbers in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: your, when you're creating seed,
but I know at the same time, you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly operating on scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's sort of like, you've got a
relatively small to medium scale setup,
[SPEAKER_00]: but lots of plant numbers in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you, how do you find it is
navigating that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think for a lot of people,
they get quite scared by the idea of how
[SPEAKER_00]: many plants you have in that space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I, I was, uh, pretty lucky on,
on having remote property and then people
[SPEAKER_03]: that were interested in making their
living by selling, uh, unseeded weed that
[SPEAKER_03]: we would grow side by side with,
with, uh, my seeded plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to enlist those people, um,
to help me with my work, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: extensive when you're growing 1200 plants
on your own, it's almost impossible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, to get two or three people to help me
with that work, uh, during the summer
[SPEAKER_03]: season was a godsend.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I, I had some remote cabins and a
large lodge to work in and pretty much,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, so, so remote that, uh, we never,
hardly ever saw anybody there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Canadian miners would stop by every
once in a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, uh, I was amazed at how closed
mouth they were about everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, nonjudgmental, uh, you know,
a bottle of whiskey, but, uh, a mile of a
[SPEAKER_03]: zipper on their, on their mouse,
you know, so, uh, or, or just having
[SPEAKER_03]: cigarettes around or, you know,
it was, uh, you know, somebody wasn't into
[SPEAKER_03]: pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were always into something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they, they pretty much kept quiet about
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we only had, uh, real trouble one
time, um, that I can remember in all those
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it's, it's, it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: To do anything outside of, of your own
home, large scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as breeding, I, I wouldn't
recommend, you know, unless you have large
[SPEAKER_03]: outbuildings and you can do isolation work
and you can isolate your males.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can isolate clones that you might
bring in from someone else to work with
[SPEAKER_03]: that genetic material, unless you have
specific build outs, uh, rooms to,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, separate, separate and segregate,
uh, your plants and your plant stock and
[SPEAKER_03]: your strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you're doing yourself and everyone
else a disservice by trying to breed under
[SPEAKER_03]: those circumstances.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like I said, I got lucky, but there
were people profiting off of what I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I wasn't interested in that and no
one could understand, uh, my preoccupation
[SPEAKER_03]: with seeds, even myself, probably,
um, I would compare myself to a crazy
[SPEAKER_03]: collector that you might see on,
uh, on, uh, one of those television
[SPEAKER_03]: programs that these guys go through the,
some, a hoarder, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in my instance, they're walking
through all these plants going,
[SPEAKER_03]: why is all your weeds seeded?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you nuts?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, I got that for years for most
of my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, the transition to all of a sudden
people are interested in things like,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, Acapulco gold and Panama red.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, have you even tried it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it looked like skanky weed back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, uh, you know, bunk compared to,
to what you think of as great weed you're
[SPEAKER_03]: showing me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're telling me there's a lot of weed
snobs where I live right here in,
[SPEAKER_03]: in, in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I might've created that problem
because over the years they've,
[SPEAKER_03]: they've had access to some things that
people will never see in a lifetime.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, to be able to smoke that kind of weed,
um, you know, generates a certain type of,
[SPEAKER_03]: of person over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't apologize for it either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I envy those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw some weird parallels there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got me thinking about my brother who's
like only a very casual weed smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to explain to him, I'm like,
dude, you understand like the shit I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: giving you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like no one gets can try this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like you're quite a fan of
open pollinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the primary method in which you
choose to breed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there any degree of sort of
selection around the males or it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: like everything stays and does its thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, only when I'm doing IBLs does that
happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, when I'm breeding, I breed,
if I'm going to bring something to an F5,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll backcross it a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm certain I'm looking for traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm looking for recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking for traits that, that I want
to keep in the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, to do that, uh, that selection,
I keep away from everybody else at,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, uh, especially when I was,
uh, having people growing commercial weed
[SPEAKER_03]: right alongside what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They knew certain rooms are off limits to
them because I didn't want to introduction
[SPEAKER_03]: of, of a pollen from a male room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to have, uh, you know,
cross pollination.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to have any, any kind of
issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I, you know, I've been called an
asshole more than once over, over my
[SPEAKER_03]: protocols with, uh, with having people
grow for me and, and, uh, and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, uh, had quite a few people quit,
you know, saying, you know, just way too
[SPEAKER_03]: strict.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to loosen up and smoke more of what
I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, but, um, to, to do it right and
to, to, to keep it, um, for the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I mean, the future for me is now just
making sure that it goes to, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: family and friends that a lot of these
things can be carried on and shared with
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, I don't have the,
uh, the health and, uh, and, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: longevity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, no one lives forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been pushing the limits,
um, you know, to keep, to keep these
[SPEAKER_03]: things in a, in a box would be a crime.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've always said that, you know,
everybody says, what are you going to deal
[SPEAKER_03]: with all those damn seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you've got, you know,
for a long time, I used to feed old seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: to chickens and yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one friend talked me out of it
and he started a seed, uh, a seed bank and
[SPEAKER_03]: a business out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I go, well, maybe I just ought to hang
onto those old seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why you thought you
shouldn't give them to the chickens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so are there any specific sort of
traits or what you might consider to be
[SPEAKER_00]: like telltale signs that you look for in a
mail that you think, Oh, that's like
[SPEAKER_00]: usually a sign of a good mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I, I've tried to tell every,
I've, I've mentored a lot of different
[SPEAKER_03]: growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, some of them are on Instagram,
some of them, uh, um, personally here at
[SPEAKER_03]: home.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, the first thing I look for in a
seedling when it pops up is that it
[SPEAKER_03]: develops like trichome hairs on it or it
doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a shiny leaf, usually that phenol,
I'll eliminate it right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll start out with a thousand seedlings
and pretty quickly get down to a hundred.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the same thing goes with the mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I start turning a mail, I'm looking
for it to actually produce its trichomes
[SPEAKER_03]: early and have a poisonous coating on the
stock itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so a lot of, a lot of people have
said, well, your weed gets me,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to go to the dispensary
because your weed gets me stolen more
[SPEAKER_03]: than, you know, and even though it's
seeded than, than anything at the
[SPEAKER_03]: dispenser.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, well, if we don't support
these people, then we're going to lose
[SPEAKER_03]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you know, I can still give you
stuff, but not in the, not in the amounts
[SPEAKER_03]: that I have before and, and, uh,
please support those people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing this to breed, um, not,
not to, not to sell specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, it's hard to explain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sound like a crazy person to myself now.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we are really congruent in a
lot of our beliefs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to ask you, you sort of,
without directly touching on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: did reference some of the problems with
the dispensaries, not just the quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: the dispensaries, which is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, but more importantly,
that there seems to be a lack of consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: education occurring out of the
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're in this position now where
someone walks into a dispensary and they
[SPEAKER_00]: just say, what's got the highest THC
percentage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's sort of where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: How, how do you think we can help move
past this and help educate the casual
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer who in all honesty is probably
never going to want to learn too much
[SPEAKER_00]: about, you know, the genesis of chem dog
or whatever, you know, they just want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do we reach that sort of customer
and help keep the legalization fight
[SPEAKER_00]: alive?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think with what you're doing and I
really believe in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and with, uh, a really good book,
we need a book out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's as simple as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just as simple as it can possibly
be with the best tips on growing the best
[SPEAKER_03]: possible weed and the best possible weed
starts with the best possible genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get your hands on and see
[SPEAKER_03]: if you have any doubt about, uh,
my strains or, or, or what I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: preserve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just grow it out and then you can give me
feedback on, on what you're finding,
[SPEAKER_03]: but don't bitch before you've,
you've grown a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't buy into the anti-hype.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what, what also needs to happen is
this needs to become a more positive in
[SPEAKER_03]: my, I know I'm, I don't live in a rainbows
and fairy tales, but it needs to be more
[SPEAKER_03]: of a positive community where we're aiding
each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, kind of the reason I'm doing
the podcast, we're teaching the younger
[SPEAKER_03]: generation, Hey, you don't have as many
roadblocks or hurdles to go through.
[SPEAKER_03]: So concentrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: On teaching people about the benefits of
cannabis and the benefits of growing your
[SPEAKER_03]: own and the benefits of growing the best
you can possibly grow, uh, turn it into a
[SPEAKER_03]: competitor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I always believe in competitive
sports, very highly competitive person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, turn it into a competitive sport,
you know, who can, who can outgrow their,
[SPEAKER_03]: their friends and using what genetics
things like that, um, got us to where
[SPEAKER_03]: we're at today and the hippies,
uh, they were, they were a huge part in
[SPEAKER_03]: it, you know, that, that whole subculture,
um, God bless them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if they hadn't kept it alive,
it would have disappeared.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a lot of obstacles in the
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see that from my perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I talk to people, I can certainly
identify in my own journey that it feels
[SPEAKER_00]: as though it's been certainly a lot easier
than many of the stories I hear from
[SPEAKER_00]: guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to quickly loop back one
moment to the RKS because I think a
[SPEAKER_00]: sentiment that I hear really commonly in
the community is people keep saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: look, if, if the RKS really existed,
it would be out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd all be sharing the clone and like,
that would be the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of, I guess the gist of it is
like, if it exists, it would have been
[SPEAKER_00]: found.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts to that sentiment?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't, I don't particularly know
that my roadkill skunk that I,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, inherited from someone else
there, they passed on to, um, I don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: if it's what people were trying somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally can't remember a smell or
taste from a week ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe yesterday I could remember a smell
or taste specifically, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: a week ago, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, all these years down the road,
um, I will tell you that it was actively,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, you know, supplying people with,
with these seeds and with clones up and
[SPEAKER_03]: down the Pacific up high five up and down
high five, the Pacific Northwest quarter,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially, but I'd go all the way to San
Diego because I was trading genetics down
[SPEAKER_03]: there years ago too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was some awfully good genetics
that came out of, uh, San Diego,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, a lot can be done in
full sun that can't be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, my hats off to the gorilla
glow growers that risk, uh, fires,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, law enforcement, uh, feral animals was
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, with somebody in a, almost a desert
climate was able to produce outdoors,
[SPEAKER_03]: just blow me away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course I wanted any genetics I
could, I could call from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I went out of my way to find
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have heard in the past about
some mythical strains coming out of San
[SPEAKER_00]: Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like you're in a,
the right spot at the right time,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is beautiful to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to quickly follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I had seen on your Instagram that you
had crossed what I think is an RKS male to
[SPEAKER_00]: a few different things like doing
outcrosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was interested to hear your thoughts
because obviously, you know, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people are keen on the IBL, but I'm
interested to hear about the outcrosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they, I think out crossing is the
spice of life to me, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, I noticed specifically you
did a Bubba Kush outcross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm such a big fan of Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did that one turn out?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what sort of things do you think RKS
brings to the table when you do hybridize
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I, I select actually for,
like I, like I did when I, when I'm at it,
[SPEAKER_03]: probably about an F13 right now on what
I've worked the RKS up to now and that
[SPEAKER_03]: includes eight back crosses, um,
looking for select traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and it really is, um, it's a complex,
uh, strain to work with, to, to find those
[SPEAKER_03]: recessive traits, to get rid of some and
to amend others.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so over time that, that was,
that was, uh, really difficult,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I mean, the chem, the chem dog that I
got from Trichome Tech in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there were a couple of guys in,
uh, um, kind of central Northern
[SPEAKER_03]: California, um, that had an ad in high
times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got their chem dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got quite a few different strains from
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, that I bought online at the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I heard that they were really,
uh, finicky like I was, uh, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, just, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get, you get to a point where other
people just think you're a mad scientist
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know, kind of, kind of like the
Cheech and Chong movie, uh, nice strains
[SPEAKER_03]: where the, the guy down in the pool,
uh, his name was Jimmy and on that go in
[SPEAKER_03]: there and, uh, ask him a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all he'd say was big buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you kind of get to be that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, I, I got poked a lot of fun
out over the years that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: cause I had friends come and, you know,
getting weed, you know, they're just out
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to score a bag the best way they
could.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the best way they could was,
Hey, let's go see if Jim needs a hand or,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, go out there and, uh,
check out his place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if he needs a hand with something,
maybe we could score some weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, that the back crosses have been
probably, like you say, some of the most
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting things that I've, I've done
for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know, uh, that the roadkill had
that potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I've already gotten back from several
people, uh, seeds, um, with their,
[SPEAKER_03]: their crosses with roadkill, uh,
one comes to mind, uh, a blueberry that I
[SPEAKER_03]: recently received from somebody and,
and I popped in there, they're going,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, I can give you the results at a later
date, but, um, everything I've crossed it
[SPEAKER_03]: with, uh, turns out to be a better plan,
but retains a lot of, uh, the roadkill,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, skunk sent to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even throwing it in into skunk,
number one, uh, I've, I've got a skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: number one and super skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I threw it into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got new Rana's super skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I threw it into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All it did was accentuate that skunk and
make it stronger with, with, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: when I'm using the males.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, when you're using the females and
you're crossing to a male of a different,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, parentage, um, you're, you're,
uh, finding that it's not as heavy on the
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk.
Side.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you're not, you're not getting
those turps coming through as heavy as if,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you used, uh, the male roadkill skunk
as a parent.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I'm trying to keep them as F ones,
but I've, I've sent them out, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: to testers, uh, four corners of this
nation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use a tester friend of mine in Maine,
who's been working with me for years,
[SPEAKER_03]: a friend of mine in Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Friend of mine in San Diego and a friend
of mine in Seattle, Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also have a friend in Canada,
um, that's, uh, been running a lot of my
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff and I take everything they give me
and try and improve upon it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the F ones are saying of the,
uh, roadkill skunk by, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: different crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can give you a list of some of the
crosses I recently did and, um,
thick skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: They came out phenomenal, but I'm,
I guess I'm never happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the problem about, uh, being a
breeder and having the original,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, genetics to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're never happy with what somebody else
says.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is great because you see
something that, that no one else does
[SPEAKER_03]: because you've worked with that particular
plant for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at true perfectionist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: To a point that it really irritates a lot
of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't, I can't apologize for it because
it's taken me to here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but as far as, as far as, uh,
uh, breeders using, um, my genetics,
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I just, uh, like with Todd's situation,
I really respect Todd.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, and, and I like what he's
doing and trying to preserve the seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I honestly think it's in his best
interest to send things out to test,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, because he'll, he'll grow more as a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if he learns to take, uh, other
people's, uh, um, objective criticism and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, uh, wherever they're at and they're,
uh, they're, uh, growing and then they
[SPEAKER_03]: might not even be as, uh, as competent a
grower as Todd is, but they're,
[SPEAKER_03]: they might be better at breeding and
finding recessive traits and things that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that he's just not looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The, the Bubba Kush that you mentioned,
I got from, uh, a breeder and,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, he's in the Southern part of
Washington state, really well known.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met him on a, on a seed trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in this group and Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, that was my introduction
to this, uh, another crackpot guy named
[SPEAKER_03]: Preston White, uh, started a seed group
and a lot of people I know to this day on
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram, um, and they're, they're
prolific breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they started out, uh, trading
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, that's all I did was just trade
genetics, try and get some of this stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: out there, um, that I, I thought was just
going to disappear otherwise, but they
[SPEAKER_03]: were really interested in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were really interested in
crossing using, using those strains to
[SPEAKER_03]: cross with a friend of mine in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He, uh, he's got a company called five 17.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has used a lot of these, uh,
these older strains and crossed them to
[SPEAKER_03]: newer stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the hype stuff that I I'm not
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I don't have the wherewithal to,
uh, to preserve them because I've got so
[SPEAKER_03]: much in my library as it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, uh, on your Instagram feed,
I saw that there was Mac crossroad Kilskun
[SPEAKER_00]: is this where that project came from?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, yeah, that, that was,
you know, and this is a recent project
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mac, uh, really kind of blew me away
because it doesn't accept pollen very
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think actually funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that just a few days ago,
some studies came out showing that Mac is
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the few true polyploidy plants out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's effectively, as you said,
yeah, incapable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously you can make crosses
with it if you really force it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but generally speaking, as you said,
doesn't want to take pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of trifolate on it, um, on,
on the Mac and, uh, to get it to polonite,
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to use six different, uh,
I finally found the right male that it
[SPEAKER_03]: would accept pollen from, from the arc
RKS.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, yeah, I'm currently working on
that, uh, trying to, trying to get it to
[SPEAKER_03]: be more stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but the results are alarmingly great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the reports last summer from the,
the, the F ones that, that I sent out,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, were just great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, and I thought so too,
um, when I grew it out unseeded,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, oh, wow, this is, this is really
good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't want to take somebody's
genetics without their authorization and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and release it to anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't, and I've kind of,
you know, until I run into that fellow
[SPEAKER_03]: with the fake beard at, at, uh,
the Emerald Cup again, or one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: shows, then, uh, then I would,
I wouldn't even think about releasing it
[SPEAKER_03]: unless I got his approval and I'd make
sure he got seed stock first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think cap's a pretty reasonable guy and
he would probably take you up on that
[SPEAKER_00]: offer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know him, but I'm just saying,
you know, um, that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I just, I preserve stuff and
then I, then I work with stuff that I
[SPEAKER_03]: really like, but I was still really
surprised that, um, some of my more
[SPEAKER_03]: resilient, um, male, uh, donors for,
uh, pollen were not accepted by this,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, caps cut that I, I, uh, sourced.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, I was just blown away
by its production by not seeding it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought this is one that I'm gonna,
I'm gonna go ahead and push forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and another friend of mine,
Antonio Diaz, great guy, met him on this,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, group, uh, the seed trading group,
uh, that Preston White, uh, started.
[SPEAKER_03]: He, uh, created a, uh, a strain called
Lamula and it was just out of this world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to add the roadkill skunk to
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, trying to dial that in right now,
the F ones, they're just producing med,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the yields are really low on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was more of a diesel-y plant,
had the real strong diesel turps,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you add that to RKS.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, honestly, roadkill skunk just
pales in comparison as to the skunk turps
[SPEAKER_03]: that are thrown out there from that added
diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be the real combo is like a
real fuel-y, gas-y in combo with the RKS.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hadn't, you know, I did, uh,
I took a Selma's New York city,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, diesel and I crossed it to roadkill
skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that also produced some awesome F ones
that I, that I recently released.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, just, uh, just blew me away that,
um, that diesel, uh, was actually a fuel
[SPEAKER_03]: for the, the skunk turps, you know,
just kicked it up a notch, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: even more than, uh, where I've gotten my
F13 roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, well, this, this stinks heavier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's a, it lingers in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you wipe the walls,
you're, you're getting that perspiration
[SPEAKER_03]: from the plant and you go outside and it
stinks to high heaven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really interesting to hear
because I could see that you have worked
[SPEAKER_00]: with some other modern genetics in the
past, specifically, uh, the driving rain,
[SPEAKER_00]: which uses Sunset Sherbert, Bruce Banner,
Purple Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sort of made me wonder, was there
anything specifically that stimulated you
[SPEAKER_00]: to think, you know what, I'm going to do a
cross with some more modern stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think largely it's, um,
probably one of the only crosses you offer
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't have quite a, uh,
what's the word, um, a provenance to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like a very long established
sort of history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything that stimulated you to
do that one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you know, a friend of mine wanted a
Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went in search of a Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my hands on, uh, um, a Sun,
a Sunset Sherbert, uh, cuttings in
[SPEAKER_03]: Fremont, Washington at the, uh,
high times, uh, cannabis cup and,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, guy there had them and, you know,
he said, yeah, this is a great Sherbert,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's not the original Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to try.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is called Sunset Sherbert from this
dude I'll call Sherbinski.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, well, cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, yeah, I'll, I'll buy some clones
from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I brought them home.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, that cross is epic up
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, driving rain is probably one of the
most surprising, I would say killer
[SPEAKER_03]: crosses that I've ever created.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's a beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the terpenes are, are across the map.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the stone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I think because of dark horses,
genetics in there, the Bruce Banner,
[SPEAKER_03]: number three that I used, it was,
it was a bomber.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, I wasn't into polys and I wanted
to try my hand at, uh, poly hybrids
[SPEAKER_03]: because, uh, my belief and, and a lot of
others beliefs with, if you use any more
[SPEAKER_03]: than, uh, one indica or one sativa or two
sativas or two indicas as a hybrid,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're, you're going to breed out
resiliency.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, some of the, um, um, environmental
factors that are, that are, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: a strong genetic plant brings to the table
or a land race, something that's been
[SPEAKER_03]: grown by people for generations as food or
medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, once you breed out of that,
then you're going to lose, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: some of, uh, the stability of the plant
itself here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That, that particular cross is one of my
favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as what it's done to help people
medicinally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know personally, two cancer
survivors here that grew it out and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's had wonderful results for them
locally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and, and they swear by it and they
keep, you know, uh, growing that
[SPEAKER_03]: particular strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, you know, as far as what it's done
and it out produced my wildest imagining
[SPEAKER_03]: on, on polys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Poly hybrids, and it kind of changed my
mind on poly hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that particular plant, even though
it's more sativa leaning outside,
[SPEAKER_03]: our growing season ends in October.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll finish before October outside up
here, even a rainy environment with no,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the strains that I used in there seem
to retain their strength and vigor and
[SPEAKER_03]: pass on, uh, some of their ability.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the environmental stresses to,
uh, stand the test of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's strange for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny you bring that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I don't, I don't really advertise it
that much because, uh, it's been so great
[SPEAKER_03]: locally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have made more, uh, more F ones
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a killer on paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sort of caught my eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought, yeah, that, that seems like
a good one to talk about out of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there any specific reason you thought
that purple Afghani would pair well with
[SPEAKER_00]: that sort of more modern combo?
[SPEAKER_03]: To tell you the honest truth, that purple
Afghani is one of the first that I
[SPEAKER_03]: personally sourced, um, in Afghanistan
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, I almost got in trouble for that
particular plant, but, uh, I happened to
[SPEAKER_03]: glean this, the seeds off the plant and,
uh, and, uh, tell a few fibs to get myself
[SPEAKER_03]: back to where I had to be and,
uh, uh, back to the States with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, yeah, that, that Afghani has
thrown a, uh, a blue tint into everything
[SPEAKER_03]: that I've grown, um, and bred with,
uh, bred towards certain things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bred a blueberry years and years ago
here, uh, 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we have a blueberry festival here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So somebody was like, Hey man,
why don't, why don't you have a blueberry
[SPEAKER_03]: pot?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, well, you know, I'll work.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll work towards that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, that was one of the things I
used, but you cut the plant, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: some, uh, sorry if I'm rambling on,
but some Colombians and Mexicans will
[SPEAKER_03]: bleed a red.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this purple Afghani bleeds purple
and it will stain anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it actually stains the blood from
that plant will stain, uh, clothing,
[SPEAKER_03]: fabric, uh, paper, linen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but as far as a breeding stock,
it brings a blue, beautiful, beautiful
[SPEAKER_03]: lavender tent to anything I put into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I was trying to bring out
when I added it in with that, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: sunset Sherbert, because it already had
that lilt already.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had that, uh, uh, lavender vibrancy,
but I didn't think it was deep enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I added that and, uh, that brought it
up a notch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Bruce banner, uh, to be quite
honest with you, a lot of my strains were
[SPEAKER_03]: medicinal for people here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, um, I told the local dispensary,
owner that I was adding this Bruce banner
[SPEAKER_03]: added to grew a green crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just been a stellar,
stellar, stellar, uh, plant, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: both, uh, they sell it, uh, commercially
in their dispensary, got the seeds from me
[SPEAKER_03]: and have been growing it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a skunk by Bruce banner, uh,
has been available locally here too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been a knockout success.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so I wanted to increase, uh,
people get to a certain point where pot
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't get them stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they're using it for medicine,
if it's not getting them stoned,
[SPEAKER_03]: they begin to look for something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, you know, I love these
strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you take these strains and,
and make them a little stronger somehow?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, well, I'll try my best.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I think I know a strain,
you know, at the time dark horse,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, had produced, uh, you know,
was fairly new.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Bruce banner number three was coming
out as the most stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I used it and, and, uh, it actually
increased the THC level where people were
[SPEAKER_03]: just, uh, going nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, they wanted to grow their
own.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was actually before, um,
legalization we've been legal in Alaska
[SPEAKER_03]: since 1975 Raven versus Alaska.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody wants to look it up,
uh, we, we won the rights to legalization,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, different administrations have tried
them to make it legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Illegal, but Alaska's constitution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the key kept it legal in
Alaska since 1975, no matter what the
[SPEAKER_03]: efforts of prohibitionists was to change
that fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even, uh, if you just brought that up
in court, along with the government having
[SPEAKER_03]: a medicinal patent on marijuana,
uh, pretty much you want every court case
[SPEAKER_03]: that you had the, uh, the nuts and the,
and the money to go to court with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely a definingly unique
characteristic of Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just to sort of follow up on what
we've been talking about, I was curious,
[SPEAKER_00]: are there any modern strains that do
impress you?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like largely speaking,
you enjoy the more old world strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: but does anything strike you as,
as special or as unique as maybe say the
[SPEAKER_00]: roadkill?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the roadkill is, it's just a
special strain period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it, it takes you back and makes it,
it's basically a time traveling strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I call several these strains because
the unique effect is to bring you back to
[SPEAKER_03]: that time and place where you're driving,
driving down the road, listening to BTO,
[SPEAKER_03]: taking care of business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you were all that back in,
in the day again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so, you know, in actual outer,
you're an old fat band and you're cruising
[SPEAKER_03]: down the road in an old truck.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, yeah, for, for those, those
specific things that I look for,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, I'm not looking for a time travel
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking for a spatial weed that,
that takes you out there and then lets you
[SPEAKER_03]: down, uh, fairly easy towards the end of
the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm, I'm, I'm really, uh, working with
sativas a lot right now from, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: Columbia and Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, trying to find that one specific
hybrid, uh, that'll do that again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to have in my stable a couple and,
um, Punto Rojo comes to mind that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're an all day stone, you know,
pretty much, you know, the fabled three
[SPEAKER_03]: hour high that you could, you know,
kick around town and do everything you
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted to do, but still be, uh,
uh, high with a, with a positive outlook.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that does that for me and
somebody turns me on to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm investigating.
[SPEAKER_03]: I start to disseminate it, take it apart,
uh, figure out how it grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, somebody tells me about a specific
stone like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm after.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, personally, and for people that,
um, medicinally, and that's how I got,
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost two wives to cancer and,
and, um, those strains, when I was growing
[SPEAKER_03]: them out, that helped them to uplift them,
to, uh, give them a normal day without
[SPEAKER_03]: opiates, uh, to, uh, help raise my
children, uh, to bring a level of
[SPEAKER_03]: happiness, uh, to them, uh, in,
you know, in the process of death.
[SPEAKER_03]: That, you know, there's no higher calling
for cannabis in my opinion, in my personal
[SPEAKER_03]: opinion and in my, uh, experience with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I had police in Washington state
come to my house, ready to kick down the
[SPEAKER_03]: door because somebody reported,
you know, smelling a grow at this house.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I was in the, in the yard in
handcuffs.
[SPEAKER_03]: My wife was upstairs and she'd lost all
her hair from chemo.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I told them, I said, look
officer, before you go in, you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: go in and take my wife's medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm serious about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's, you know, stage four.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, she's been told that there's
not much left for her.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's just trying to be here for our
little children.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just tread carefully.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go with you and tell you anything you
want.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have all my stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you right where my grow is,
uh, downstairs in my garage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, just, you know, be careful with what's
there and, uh, be respectful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and he went in the house,
saw my wife, talked to my wife,
[SPEAKER_03]: tipped his hat, walked out, came and
locked my cuffs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is when it was still super
illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no compassion or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, you know, we didn't find anything
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, you have a great day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry to have bothered you,
but I had to investigate this and I have
[SPEAKER_03]: to fill out my report now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll just say that there was use going
on, but I didn't personally see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where it ended.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, to this day, I've never been able
to thank that guy, but, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a kind of positive stuff that,
that I like to see behind cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, what it does to help other
people is way beyond anything that I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: personally doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have any aspirations or,
or, you know, financial aspirations or
[SPEAKER_03]: otherwise, just a crazy old guy that's,
uh, preserved a bunch of strains and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and work with, uh, what I can to help
other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me, I made good money at doing what
I did for a living as a commercial diver
[SPEAKER_03]: and, uh, and, um, union electrician that I
could support my family just off of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I, what I did otherwise, just a crazy
hobby that no one could really quite
[SPEAKER_03]: figure out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, well, you don't sell pot,
but you help people with seeds and you
[SPEAKER_03]: give seeds away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's all that about?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, you know, I really couldn't never
tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is probably the most I've ever talked
about it outside of a few friends here
[SPEAKER_03]: that know me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, what a really personal and touching
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, thank you so much for sharing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you really hit the head of the
problem of our community, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, sometimes I think we lose sight of
what the real utility of this plant is,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is to help us all get through life a
little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are willing to discuss it,
are there any strains you have that if
[SPEAKER_00]: someone listening was a little bit unwell
themselves, you might recommend from your
[SPEAKER_00]: catalog that might be what you feel is
particularly medicinal?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because of, because of the profile
that's left in it, the 1974, Matt Niska,
[SPEAKER_03]: Thunderfuck is one of the best because it
has a CBD still in the plant, the CBG,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, the THCV.
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't been bred out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's been, you know, as, as much as I
could kept it as close as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Maui Waui is at an F-18.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's, it's about, it's about as,
as, uh, original as, as they come.
[SPEAKER_03]: My Concha Cambodian, uh, it's a really
good, uh, Cambodian that, like I said,
[SPEAKER_03]: it has the THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a really high, um, soaring,
um, like a tie, but it's a heavy enough
[SPEAKER_03]: stone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I think it's, uh, essential to
people's, uh, mental wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really, uh, brings, uh, about a,
uh, a calming effect of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, I have a strain called, uh,
FOB, which is forward operating base.
[SPEAKER_03]: I created it specifically for people with
PTSD, um, you know, fellow veterans and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, uh, you know, you'd be surprised,
uh, how many people have PTSD?
[SPEAKER_03]: PTSD were never veterans, uh, but life
experiences, trauma, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, so a range of crimes that were
committed against people, um, just even
[SPEAKER_03]: growers, you know, that have spent years
like myself, there's only a certain amount
[SPEAKER_03]: of crazy people that can stay locked up
in, uh, little rooms, growing plants for
[SPEAKER_03]: all these years waiting for, you know,
a gun at your back of your head or your
[SPEAKER_03]: door to be kicked in or, um, you know,
that, that mentality, you need something
[SPEAKER_03]: that is going to help you every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, that's what I created,
uh, FOB for, um, I've, I've made that
[SPEAKER_03]: available as much as I can to,
to anybody that needs it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, a chocolate tie that I picked up,
um, years ago, um, down in California is
[SPEAKER_03]: one of those, uh, tie strains that,
um, really helps with, uh, anxiety,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, mental fatigue.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people are, are just worn out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's helped a lot of my friends,
uh, just recently with, uh, everything
[SPEAKER_03]: going on from COVID lockup to just even
wearing a mask.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they tell me, Hey, I have to go
out with this damn thing, uh, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I smoke some of that chocolate tie,
I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't lose it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not too high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have any anxiety and I can get
done what I need to get done while wearing
[SPEAKER_03]: that mask.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Mastodon, um, is a, uh, very sedative,
um, indica plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the combination of two local strains,
two growers, uh, that, that I inherited
[SPEAKER_03]: their strains are passed on now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I combine them and call them Mastodon,
uh, years ago, um, 20 some years ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's, it's a beautiful plant, uh,
very gassy, but it's, it's a strong
[SPEAKER_03]: sedative painkiller and it helps with
insomnia and sleep problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the cat piss I got in, uh,
I originally sourced it in, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, Garberville, but I had to go to San
Diego to actually get the cuttings that
[SPEAKER_03]: was, uh, it was owned by a motorcycle
club, uh, priority, uh, proprietary,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't want to really release it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They asked me not to release it in its
form, but they knew I was breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, we can go ahead and cross it to
whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just leave our name off of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so the, the cat piss has an effect,
a speedy effect, uh, uh, pick you up,
[SPEAKER_03]: move you throughout the day, uh,
get you from point A to point B.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it was really popular with,
uh, the biker culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, for something like that,
when somebody is trying to recover,
[SPEAKER_03]: it just, uh, over and above any other
strain I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the cat piss crossed with just about
anything, picks people up and propels them
[SPEAKER_03]: through the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really, really good, um,
strain for recovery in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could, I could keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm picking up is that you're
obviously very passionate about old school
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be interested to find out what is
some of your absolute favorites,
[SPEAKER_00]: because something I've picked up as a sort
of recent trend is that more and more,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there's a wider appreciation
for Mexican lines, Acapulco Gold,
[SPEAKER_00]: Punto Rojo, even Colombian, you know,
people really, really getting into these
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the most memorable lines
in your mind?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Michoacan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michoacan is, uh, you know, one of those,
uh, uh, Mexican strains, uh, Oaxacan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another, uh, Mexican strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I have two different, uh, um,
Oaxacan's, uh, Oaxaca is a large district,
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of like a, a state here in the United
States, you know, it's a large district.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, the Oaxacan that I have comes from
a, uh, uh, more of a hill, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: mountainous region, part of Oaxaca.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so it, it has, uh, THCV.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, THC and, uh, CBD in it has some
of its original and, and it, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: it retains a lot of its, uh, um,
vigor that it has outdoors when grown
[SPEAKER_03]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not a super long flowering,
uh, plant for a Sativa dominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that Oaxacan, um, yeah, it's,
it's, it's been worked a lot, but probably
[SPEAKER_03]: before I got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably by, you know, original cartels,
um, you know, um, basically what built
[SPEAKER_03]: Mexican drug cartels, a lot of people
don't know this was marijuana that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, where before they got into
anything else, marijuana was the product
[SPEAKER_03]: of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it crossed the border,
it was degraded because they pressed it
[SPEAKER_03]: into bricks and it, and it fermented and
got mold in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a whole lot of chemistry that
happened in them bricks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but if you could, source the weed like
I did across the border and actually go to
[SPEAKER_03]: where the growers were, were, were,
uh, growing the plants, those Mexican
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders and growers were really
knowledgeable and ahead of their time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, uh, we got sensibilia,
uh, seedless weed from the Mexican people,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, back in that era.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if, if it hadn't been for them
trying to develop a seedless product to
[SPEAKER_03]: send across the border, um, you know,
it was just a matter of time before people
[SPEAKER_03]: discovered, wow, we, we get, you know,
a better stone and a, and a, and a heavier
[SPEAKER_03]: product if we don't let it seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, you got to give credit
where credit's due too, with, with,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, marijuana and cannabis history,
the people that came before us,
[SPEAKER_03]: the people that, that really did the work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I'm a huge believer in putting in
the work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your end product, uh, meets or exceeds
what people are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's not a popular thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one of our listeners, our Patreon
supporters asks, can you ask if he can
[SPEAKER_00]: expand a little bit on his creation big
tuna?
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff looks killer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big tuna.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, yeah, no big tuna.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I can't really, it's not my creation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't want to take credit for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just something I've continued onto
this day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a person that, uh, created that
strain is recently deceased.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I kind of, um, hit on some
of that, um, just recently with,
[SPEAKER_03]: with the relatives on, on what I could do
with that strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now they're just kind of,
they're not talking about a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this seemed to be their least,
uh, prior priority.
[SPEAKER_03]: In life.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, yeah, sorry not to answer that
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, more sort of pressing things on
their mind at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously we had another fan submitted
question, which I'm actually very curious
[SPEAKER_00]: about myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, can you ask Jaime about the
poster he's got that says good for the
[SPEAKER_00]: head Panama red?
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for the head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, there's an old,
I don't know if you listen to a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: music, but there's an old stoner band,
uh, called per writers of the purple sage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, Jerry Garcia played in there
for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they had, they had a song called Panama
red.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you listen to it, you'll hear,
uh, similar lyrics to that in the song.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like an old sort of Jerry
throwback.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: New writers of the purple sage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, if I had the albums almost
within arm reach, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I grabbed the album and show you,
but, uh, yeah, if you just look up,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, new writers of the purple sage,
uh, on the front, the artwork is a cover,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, of the album is a picture of Panama
red himself, you know, so it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a great old song.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, uh, probably that particular
post came from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I was cruising through all the
strains you offered, I, I noticed that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Alaskan cannabis case sells just a
straight Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was curious to know, um,
like what's the origins of this Afghani?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it from Afghani number one or something
you collected?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that's, that's actually a great story
in itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I, I went to Innsbruck, uh,
for the winter Olympics and I ran into a
[SPEAKER_03]: hippie couple that was, uh, had traveled
all the way from India, uh, through
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I asked them, you know,
we're, we're back and forth talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a young man and, and, uh,
really interested in sports at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically there to, to, uh,
you know, first Olympics I was ever able
[SPEAKER_03]: to attend, uh, just see what's going on
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I had run into people that were as
interested in marijuana as I was,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're transporting seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they had some, uh, peer after an
Afghani, um, from an Afghani farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: They stayed with for about a week and,
uh, he helped them make some bricks of
[SPEAKER_03]: hash, which they were going from at that
time, Innsbruck, Germany, to somewhere in
[SPEAKER_03]: France.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, I don't remember where,
and I probably wouldn't say if I did,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, um, then they, they brought it back
to the States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I actually got in touch with them
in California again and, and got picked up
[SPEAKER_03]: some of that black hash that they brought
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: That they were part of, uh, of making in
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but I kept those, uh, seeds,
uh, forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, um, peer Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would call it a land race,
but, um, you know, when it was grown
[SPEAKER_03]: commercially, I don't know if you can call
that a land race because somebody is
[SPEAKER_03]: growing it, uh, for the production of
hash, not, not for the plant itself there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they, if you, if you sell what
they do, they did to the plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's almost important,
uh, to us because yeah, that's all about
[SPEAKER_03]: just beating the hell out of the plants
and, and the seeds go flying everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, for somebody like me,
I've witnessed that a couple of times once
[SPEAKER_03]: in Morocco and, and another time in
Afghanistan myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, Oh my God, let me pick these
up for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had also noticed, um, on your Instagram
that you had grown out some Pakistanis
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of more recently in fact,
and I wanted to ask you about your
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I, I feel like Pakistanis like a
great indicator that often gets overlooked
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the fact that Afghanistan's
right next to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously Afghani is just incredible
in its own right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, what's your thoughts on
Pakistanis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think they're a little bit,
um, underrated?
[SPEAKER_03]: Way underrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the Chitral area, uh, what you're
referencing too, probably, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: the purple, uh, pack Pakistani Chitral
Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that's a river regional area,
a very beautiful area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, those people take extreme pride
in, in their production of hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but their, their plants are,
are just astounding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, the vibrancy of the colors
of purples that come out of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, the production of trichomes,
it, you know, to see them, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoors is all, you know, it's almost
magical.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my, my recollections of actually
seeing them in that area, um, got me kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of hooked on, and that's, yeah,
you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something I just worked on
recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a Pakistani Chitral Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, I'm trying to get it, um,
to an F, uh, four right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at an F3.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been to tester.
[SPEAKER_03]: I back crossed it once, uh, trying to,
trying to pull it up to an F4.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it, it'll be a, be a hard push for me
because I've got a lot of other projects
[SPEAKER_03]: going on right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that probably be a year off before I
even think about releasing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's a beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, we'll all have to wait with
anticipation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you almost answered the next question
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll try to bait it out of you a little
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always curious to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders, what is the thing that you're
most excited about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's the next project you're about
to start that you're like, Oh man,
[SPEAKER_00]: this one's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, again, I call myself a
preservationist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I've really taken to this breeding
thing because I've been, uh, lucky and
[SPEAKER_03]: fortunate enough to, to be able to access
all these different genetics and to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to, uh, cross them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Together, um, is just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've, I've worked extensively with
Hawaiian strains, trying to bring back
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the original Hawaiian strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I'm, I'm, uh, working again to,
to bring the Haleaka Haleakala silver
[SPEAKER_03]: sword, um, up to its, uh, um, it was grown
on the backside of Hana, uh, the backside
[SPEAKER_03]: of the Haleakala crater.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, at a pretty good elevation
in the jungle, um, by several growers from
[SPEAKER_03]: lower Nahiku road and, um, they're
prominent growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been doing it all their lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, basically since they got back from
Vietnam, they didn't even go back.
[SPEAKER_03]: They went back to California long enough
to, uh, to get discharged from the
[SPEAKER_03]: service, went right over to Hana and
became pot growing hermits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, these guys, these guys are
exceptional.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, it's, it's actually my honor to,
uh, preserve that particular strain and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and to bring it back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, they're, they're old enough where
that's all past.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not something that they're doing
anymore, but they're all behind me and
[SPEAKER_03]: want to know its progress.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's something I'm, I'm actively
working on right now and, and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, look forward to, uh, getting it
stabilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there would be a lot of
people interested in that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've, we've spoken a lot about
Indica's and you, you mentioned you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a profound love of Sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I too actually really love Sativas
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed there was a few posts on
your Instagram of some sneaky Neville's
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes slash Neville's Hayes hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously Todd has sort of made some
ripples in the water with his re-releases
[SPEAKER_00]: of Hayes more recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that the Neville's Hayes is
what you would consider to be one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: better representations of Hayes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that maybe like an NL5
Hayes is like a better sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: representation in your mind?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Neville's Hayes, I had the unique
opportunity to meet Neville and play chess
[SPEAKER_03]: with him and, and talk to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I have a different perception of
that, the man and his ethos than most
[SPEAKER_03]: people do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody, uh, degrades to the worst
common denominator.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, if you didn't get to know him and
know what a kind, giving person he was,
[SPEAKER_03]: and what an exceptional breeder he was,
he actually made such an imprint on me
[SPEAKER_03]: that I just continued doing what I was
doing and didn't think I was completely
[SPEAKER_03]: nuts for doing so, uh, because he was,
he was, uh, you know, making good money
[SPEAKER_03]: doing what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taking a lot of chances.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, his family was a hundred percent
behind him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he was also in Australia and great,
great personality.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, always outgoing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see any of the things that some
people have, have accused him of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he was an exceptional chess player and
I beat him once and I was really proud of
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, getting the Hayes from him,
I knew his parents, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: he had a Northern Lights, uh, one,
two, and three, he had the Hayes's were
[SPEAKER_03]: the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He, he numbered everything, classified
those things the same way, and then made
[SPEAKER_03]: separate crosses of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also got Northern Lights number nine
from him, which he never really released
[SPEAKER_03]: in a pure form.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it was one of the greatest Northern
Lights, but it was, uh, unique enough to
[SPEAKER_03]: preserve.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've preserved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, yeah, if I ever released that,
I'd definitely ask permission from him.
[SPEAKER_03]: From his, uh, family, but the Neville's
Hayes did have Northern Lights in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it, he crossed the Hayes with,
with, uh, Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think he told me it was the,
uh, Hayes number three.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, his, his most worked Hayes's were one,
two, and three.
[SPEAKER_03]: So number three.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it was a Northern Lights
number two that he used to create
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville's Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was really proud of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, when I brought it back,
um, the commercial growers couldn't get
[SPEAKER_03]: enough of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it produced really well indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't like a normal, uh, sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: It, it had plenty of trichome production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, maybe only thing comparable at that
time was White Widow, which I know,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, him and Scott had, uh, some work
together on producing Shantybaba.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they, they worked together on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I know there was, you know,
back and forth, but I never experienced
[SPEAKER_03]: that with Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was, uh, just a gentleman to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you know, I went to his so-called
castle and, you know, went down on the,
[SPEAKER_03]: played chess with him on the table
downstairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and it's, uh, a lot like me and just
a nut about, uh, pot at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't read enough about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't see enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't get enough exposure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't find enough genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he goes, yeah, just be careful
because, uh, it, it's a never ending road.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, you go to the road, go down this
road.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he says, it just keeps expanding in
front of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, there, there's really no end to
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I, you know, to this point,
I never thought I would be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, even still talking to people that were
interested in pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought once it got legal, that all
these strains, these old ones that I spent
[SPEAKER_03]: all this time preserving, I would have
done everything in vain because no one
[SPEAKER_03]: would want them because they want the new
shiny, uh, next grade poly hybrid,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, that, um, shines like a diamond in
comparison, um, to some of these old,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, building block strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I call them that I've kept viable for all
these years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a really unique history you've had
with Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm quite envious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to ask quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you describe that Northern lights
nine?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've ever heard anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's, it's a, uh, you know,
a lot, a lot like Northern lights number
[SPEAKER_03]: five, but I don't think it draws anything
from a Northern lights five.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has, uh, um, narrow leafs on the top of
the plant, really broad leafs on the
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom, some of the land, the bottom leafs
getting as big as my hand, more of an
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghani leaning.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then, uh, when it goes into flower,
most everything on top is all narrow leaf
[SPEAKER_03]: heavily triconed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, really dense, uh, buds, um,
very, uh, strong sedative stone,
[SPEAKER_03]: but uplifting at the same time,
like a haze, um, keeps you going,
[SPEAKER_03]: keeps you running all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, kind of like that Doobie brother song
keeps you running.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dating myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's, that's really lovely to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've spoken about, you know,
enjoying some of Neville's works and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, unfortunately our listeners won't be
able to see this because this is an audio
[SPEAKER_00]: only podcast, but I can see sneakily in
the background, there's a plant more seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: sticker, Bodie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested to know, uh, what other
breeders do you think are doing good work
[SPEAKER_00]: at the moment?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, any, anybody that's done it for the
love of the plant is in, in, in my opinion
[SPEAKER_03]: and anybody that's breeding and testing
their gear is working towards a future in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, uh, that can only be commended.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I can't, I can't take away from
anything that's anybody's doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Bodie's, uh, work with, with some of
the land races and bringing back,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, some of these older strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I do, uh, on occasion, uh,
talk to people that, um, and, and real
[SPEAKER_03]: recently, even today, uh, talk with people
that are, are giving him genetics to work
[SPEAKER_03]: with, or they're doing collaborations with
him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I know that some of his genetics
or, or all of them are true and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of what I look for.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, uh, it's like my model,
if in doubt, grow it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've grown out Bodie strains,
uh, that, that I'm interested in,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, just from people's descriptions of the
plants when they finish them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, oh yeah, that's, that's kind of
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You hit me right on the head.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like an old school plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to run that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, yeah, I, I really like what he's
doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he's a really nice guy, met him one
time, probably doesn't remember me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but you know, that's the way I prefer
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, uh, I spent a lot of time in the
shadows, uh, very, very recently,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, having coming out and, and,
uh, sharing things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't want things to disappear,
you know, and, um, that's why I'm here
[SPEAKER_03]: today, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can a hundred percent vouch for all
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bodie's got to be one of the nicest guys
you'll ever meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure he probably doesn't remember
you to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember thinking that myself the first
time I met him, I'm like, he's never going
[SPEAKER_00]: to remember me, but that's what makes him
so magical is he's so personable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he, he, I bet he doesn't
remember you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They talked about playing a bass and I.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, as, as one of my hobbies,
that's one of the things that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that I did was, you know, I had friends
that were musicians and we all love to
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'd play, you know, I had a house,
we all played and there was instruments in
[SPEAKER_03]: the, you know, in the house and all hours
of the day, people would come and crash
[SPEAKER_03]: and smoke smoke sessions going on all
hours of the night.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, police had actually come to
the door and say, you know, I have the
[SPEAKER_03]: neighbors have said this and that you want
to keep it down or we'll bust your grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, okay, you put it like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, music is another,
there's another thing that I kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: connect with because it's for a past time.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a grower, it's one of those
things you can stay home and do,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you can play music and,
and take care of your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, anybody that's farming or,
or growing knows that you only have a
[SPEAKER_03]: limited amount of time that you can go do
other things, other hobbies and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, music and musicians.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met some fantastic musicians.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met some great collectors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met, I gave a guitar to Paul Allen from
Microsoft, met him, went to his home.
[SPEAKER_03]: So music people, I knew Al Hendricks and
Leon, Jimmy Hendricks' dad and Leon,
[SPEAKER_03]: his cousin, and had spent time gigging
with them and the lion's lair on highway
[SPEAKER_03]: 99 in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, to get out there with
musicians and smoke and everybody go in
[SPEAKER_03]: the back lot and smoke out and Hey,
what's this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jesus Christ, I thought this stuff was
extinct, you know, and who are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: That, that kind of stuff keeps you going,
you know, and it revitalizes if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: plugged into music and, and you like
playing music, it gets to be a passion
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm a kindred spirit with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Links to the Hendricks family.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, you know, Al, Al just happened to be
at the same bar we were at and me and my
[SPEAKER_03]: friends played red house, which is a blues
Hendricks tune that we just absolutely
[SPEAKER_03]: loved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Leon came up on stage and wanted to
play with us, played a couple of tunes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we went out back and shared some
whiskey with Al and talked about Jimmy and
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, it was, it was a great time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was before, you know,
everybody was after Jimmy's legacy and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and what he owned and rights to music.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are part of the Hendricks family.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the family.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, but there was, you know, differences
of opinion with the sister, I guess,
[SPEAKER_03]: with Leon and, and, and Al, you know,
was he was Jimmy's dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a great guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, his 90% of Jimmy's upbringing is
what was with Al and to just sit back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a great listener.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm talking a lot right now,
but now's my opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I listen to people more than, than I'll
put out because I also want to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a great learner and, and how I learned
is listening and I can gauge what people
[SPEAKER_03]: are all about and their passions toward
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just by listening to him and Al's Al
Hendricks, his greatest passion was his,
[SPEAKER_03]: was his son, Jimmy and his upbringing.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people don't understand how
patriotic Jimmy was other than he played
[SPEAKER_03]: the star spangled banner at Woodstock.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Jimmy was a veteran of the 101st
airborne and not an easy outfit to get
[SPEAKER_03]: into.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, he had a guitar all the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was in boot camp and, and, you know,
Al made sure he sent him a guitar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hearing those stories that you hear
firsthand from a parent are different than
[SPEAKER_03]: you hear about folklore and read from
books and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the kind of stuff I get from
music.
[SPEAKER_03]: On online, I have some, I have some crazy
videos that a buddy of mine put onto
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube years ago under my alias.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jaime Chiba.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, those have come back to
haunt me and people talking, Jesus,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're a lot crazier than I thought you
were.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, you know, it's kind of just all
out there and it's a mixed mash of,
[SPEAKER_03]: of some plants and, you know, hemp fest,
number four, my son, who's, who's already
[SPEAKER_03]: a former Marine.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's in there as a, you know, 18 month old
child in a, in a stroller at hemp fest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Down to gas works park, hemp fest,
by the way, great inspiration,
[SPEAKER_03]: Vivian McPeak, one of the finest people
you ever meet on the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: My experiences with hemp fest and all the
people surrounding it, especially Jack
[SPEAKER_03]: Herrera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Phenomenal event.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's why we're here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: At this point of legalization is because
of hemp fest and, and festivals like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll even include high times efforts
with the cannabis cup and, and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and their promotion.
[SPEAKER_03]: They might've made a lot of money,
but you know, they stayed in business.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, they, they weathered the storms and,
and lawsuits and, and their founder talked
[SPEAKER_03]: to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't call myself a criminal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do call myself an outlaw because that's
the life I've lived my entire life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and you had to, to be a grower,
a breeder, a preservationist.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the price you paid.
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't a monetary price.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a price of isolation and,
and, uh, anonymous, being anonymous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a, what a rich life you've led.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's so cool to hear and almost
perfect timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You throw that in cause we're sort of on
the tail end of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, last question or two, before we get
into our quick fire questions that we
[SPEAKER_00]: always do at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized I hadn't actually asked you
this yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sort of kicking myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: What grow style do you utilize?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you an organics guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a more salts?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an organic, totally organic soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, I believe in earth boxes as a
passive hydroponic, um, soil system,
[SPEAKER_03]: organic, but, um, using, using the earth
boxes, um, I know they're expensive and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a commercial, uh, way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you can make them yourselves now,
nowadays, but I, I'd purchased so many
[SPEAKER_03]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still use them to this day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can walk away from a grow for up to two
days and not have to worry about,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, watering, um, with my, uh,
raising children and, and having a real
[SPEAKER_03]: job in life.
[SPEAKER_03]: That, that was a real benefit to me,
uh, when it ended up doing everything
[SPEAKER_03]: alone and, and didn't have, uh,
some of the backup I've been, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: really blessed to have in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had people come and go in my life
that, uh, you know, we're more passionate
[SPEAKER_03]: about the plant than just about anybody
I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, some of them were in it for their own
financial gain and they did really well,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, um, you know, just for their
assistance and everything they did to help
[SPEAKER_03]: me along the way to keep these seeds
going.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I can't thank them enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hugely, hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that having the ability to run
things with a busy life is really
[SPEAKER_00]: important and people around to help is
always very, very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably should have slotted this next
question a little earlier on when we were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about it, but we had two or three
different listeners chime in with
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially the same question and they
were wondering, have you ever grown out
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk cabbage?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think there's any relationship
between skunk cabbage and the roadkill?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I got, I got some skunk cabbage
seeds, uh, from, um, Alaska.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alaska bean brains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, uh, they didn't germinate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I didn't know that he kept them in a
freezer and, um, I probably hung onto
[SPEAKER_03]: them, uh, to drop them into a cycle of,
of, uh, growth cycle, uh, longer than I
[SPEAKER_03]: should have, because I didn't know
probably that they were frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that might've been a, um,
a reason they never germinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Alaska bean brain is a great
guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, you know, I wish I had the
opportunity to, to, uh, finish them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause he said they were, uh, it was a
great strain, but we, I have, I have a
[SPEAKER_03]: cover crop outside of, uh, all my grows
is, is a skunk cabbage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's, it's, it's an actual plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the bears eat it, the deer eat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's a plant that grows,
um, extensively in Southeast Alaska and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Up the coast of Alaska here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a sort of like a small world sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost that's, that's really cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So onto our quick fire questions,
which is the four or five questions we ask
[SPEAKER_00]: all of our guests at the end of the
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm always keen to hear people's
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one being, what is the single most
memorable cannabis experience you've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: had?
[SPEAKER_03]: The single most memorable experience I
ever had with cannabis was, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: on a new year's Eve in, uh, Maui,
Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I walked upstairs, um, is a
restaurant, uh, bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went, I walked upstairs from front
street and downtown Lahaina to a bar
[SPEAKER_03]: called the blue max.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the blue max was, uh, just fantastic
old school bar, open air.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the music coming out of it just sucked
me right in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I smoked a joint with,
uh, uh, Paco de Lucia and, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: Cecilia and Capona from Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were there with, uh, Aldi Miola,
but they'd played, played up at a resort
[SPEAKER_03]: north of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but I smoked a joint with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I listened to some music that
they were playing, um, as, and just,
[SPEAKER_03]: just a magical night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I, you know, I think the pot was a
catalyst, but, uh, I always, that's one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the strains I, I didn't find out what it
was that I had always wished that I had,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, asked them or, or, you know,
found out, you know, what the genetics
[SPEAKER_03]: were so I could re recreate that stunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it was like the most magical high
I've ever had in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, remember it to this day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's, uh, in the old blue max,
there was, uh, uh, couches for seating and
[SPEAKER_03]: you would sit like five feet away from the
band while they were playing and people
[SPEAKER_03]: would be coming streaming up the stairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, it was just, uh, just a,
uh, like an out of body experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even explain it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, just sitting there floating in the
music and, uh, and, uh, the, the great
[SPEAKER_03]: high that I had from whatever pot that
was.
[SPEAKER_03]: That I got from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The great unknown, some of the best are,
are the ones that got away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the other end of the spectrum,
what was something that you were really
[SPEAKER_00]: excited to try?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your friends had even like sort of
hyped it up a bit to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you finally got around to
trying it, you were left feeling a little
[SPEAKER_00]: disappointed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's a purple strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: That came out a while ago, purple punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was told that it was, this was the,
the, the be all and all poly hybrid that
[SPEAKER_03]: would just knock your socks out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a friend of mine got it from a place
in Oregon that sold clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like a certifiable clone and,
you know, bought it from a legitimate,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, grew it out and, uh, yeah,
it was a total let down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't, uh, anything I was expecting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, eh, sorry, I'm going to pass on,
on working with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've heard a few guests mentioned that,
uh, it certainly has the purple,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe not the punch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to drop you off on a desert
island and theoretically you can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: infinite weed for the rest of your life,
but you can only take three strains with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be either clones or seeds if you
want to maybe do some breeding or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: What three things are you going to take
with you?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, mud by delight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, number two is a strain that I created
called Pax, which is a sativa dominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I created it right after the shooting
in, uh, in France.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, uh, all the tourists were there to see
an American heavy metal band and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, Pax means peace in French.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I took a couple of, uh,
sativas and, uh, a sativa hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I had some amount of Indica in
there and, um, yeah, it's definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: something you'd want to have on a deserted
island.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's a, it's a time waster that,
uh, time is not wasted when you're high on
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's my best, uh, um,
recollection and the uh, Lahina Luna Puna
[SPEAKER_03]: butter, which is a Puna butter originally
from, uh, Kona, um, area, uh, actually a
[SPEAKER_03]: Puna district, which is on the big Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that particular strain even today
is just, uh, just a knockout.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I sourced it in, in Lahina on the
streets of line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I went up to where it was grown in the
mountains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they actually had a few sandalwood
trees, uh, which would be become a real
[SPEAKER_03]: rarity and, uh, had an opportunity to go
back to Hawaii again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went up to that, that particular patch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, all the evidence of growing pot back
then is, is long gone, but the sandalwood
[SPEAKER_03]: trees are nice and healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I had a locals asked me about their
exact location because, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: carvers and, and Pete, I said,
you know, I could show you the pictures,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could, I could walk back there
blindfolded probably, but I'll never tell
[SPEAKER_03]: anybody where exactly they are,
but, uh, beautiful trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I like, I like plants and trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got, I got redwoods growing in my own,
uh, my own yard.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them's a 30 feet high and I started
it, uh, from a seed, um, 21 years,
[SPEAKER_03]: no, 24 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really neat.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a remix of the last
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now going to, you're, you're the
captain of the boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're dropping someone else off on the
island and it's someone who you're not a
[SPEAKER_00]: big fan of, you know, you might even go so
far as to say you don't really like them
[SPEAKER_00]: and you get to choose what three strains
you're going to leave them with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to leave them on the
island with?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it might straighten them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll leave them my three favorite
strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they'll become a better person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very diplomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've, we've heard some interesting
answers from that question and I like your
[SPEAKER_00]: response a lot there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so onto our final question for the
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I gave you a time machine and you could
go to any place in history,
[SPEAKER_00]: geographically, any time in terms of like
chronologically, where would you go and
[SPEAKER_00]: what are you going to collect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Presumably you're going to collect some
seeds or a clone or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going to go and what are you
getting?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go back to Hawaii to the Blue
Max and I'm actually going to ask those
[SPEAKER_03]: people, the musicians I was talking to and
smoking with what that particular strain
[SPEAKER_03]: was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the unanswered question of my life,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one must really riddle you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It resonates constantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, uh, you know, of all the things
that were in Hawaii that I went through,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, trying to grow and trying to find that
particular, I never have found anything
[SPEAKER_03]: close to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, kind of like roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be, uh, you know, that lucid
unicorn, uh, that exists in my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that may not exist in a plant anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that just kind of, uh, keeps me going
on, uh, on the end that what I'm doing
[SPEAKER_03]: isn't all wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not crazy, uh, preserving some of
these strains because maybe there's
[SPEAKER_03]: something in, uh, in my quiver that
another person is going to, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: find just as enjoyable as I did that
strain that I now don't even know what it
[SPEAKER_03]: is anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that just about brings us to
the end of things for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were there any general comments or shout
outs you wanted to give?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, just if, if you're, uh, if you're
growing, don't, don't doubt what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: growing until you grow it out and see what
the potential is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, is something, um, isn't what you,
what you want, don't spend too much time
[SPEAKER_03]: on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we all only have so much time,
uh, breed, breed and grow towards what
[SPEAKER_03]: does it for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: What rings that bell for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, do share your genetics
and your knowledge with everybody else,
[SPEAKER_03]: because in the future, it looks like,
you know, the way we've been going the
[SPEAKER_03]: last four years, everybody's going to need
cannabis a whole lot more than,
[SPEAKER_03]: than we need it right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been around for so long,
thousands of years, helping and aiding,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, people that, uh, the more we have and
not the less we have as far as genetic,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, capability is going to be important to
everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you can, if you can grow your
own medicine and be happy, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: and remember everybody started out a
pollen checker.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no expert, uh, breeders in my
opinion, when I started out, there was
[SPEAKER_03]: only people making seeds from things they
got in, in other regions of the world and
[SPEAKER_03]: learning their chops and putting the work
in and growing and breeding and cross
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding until, you know, I'm sure
everybody can agree that we've gotten a
[SPEAKER_03]: little carry away with the poly hybrids,
but if you retain, uh, some of the good
[SPEAKER_03]: things by searching for the recessive
traits and the traits that you want and
[SPEAKER_03]: get rid of, rid of the things that you
don't want, you can probably create some
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty phenomenal poly hybrids that'll
last the test of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, just my general opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some very wise words there for people
looking to make their mark lasting and to
[SPEAKER_00]: make some cool stuff in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, a huge thank you and shout
out to our friend from the final frontier
[SPEAKER_00]: and the founder of the Alaskan cannabis
case, Jaime Chiba.
