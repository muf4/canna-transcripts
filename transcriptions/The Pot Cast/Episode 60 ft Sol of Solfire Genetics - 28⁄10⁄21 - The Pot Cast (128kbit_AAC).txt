[SPEAKER_00]: A big thank you to soul of sulfide
genetics for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been looking forward to this chat,
but the first question we ask guests when
[SPEAKER_00]: they come on the show, what have you been
smoking on recently?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, somebody sent me some banana
runs hash, and I've been smoking that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lately, I've been just smoking a lot of
solventless hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just love the taste of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really my go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, the banana runs that this couple
made is really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's kind of almost got like a
Sprite taste to it with like a banana hint
[SPEAKER_01]: to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I've been smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds undeniably delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you find the banana runs tended to
produce a range of flavor profiles or they
[SPEAKER_00]: were more just sort of one parent or the
other?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the crazy thing is, and it's
kind of like an inside joke, man,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that when you cross runs to things,
they almost always come out like runs
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant, especially in the smell category
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you'll get some run structure and
then you'll get the run smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see that like almost with all runs
crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, when I see all of these runs
crosses, I'm just like, dude, you could
[SPEAKER_01]: have just got one pack of anybody's runs
cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would have been, you know,
similar to the runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But about 20% of those, at least in the
banana runs, lean towards that banana
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll get like, I don't know,
we've seen some that are just like all
[SPEAKER_01]: purple and frosty, and then just smell
like bananas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the ones that I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's some green ones that do
that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's some that just come out
super like runcy, I would say on the run
[SPEAKER_01]: side of the things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you're going to find that range
from like that runs dominant kind of Fino
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know, just like this crop,
this just blending of both of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you get this purple frosty banana
flavored Fino.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the ones I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, look, I mean, that sounds like the
winner to me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I was sort of interested in asking
you, we sort of don't see that many
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders working with the banana ROG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always wondered why because it's
such a good cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any theories on maybe why it's
not as commonly used?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've always been like, even if you go
back to my first line, when, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the black banana, I've always loved
that banana turp like that banana candy
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that's one of my favorite flavored
candies is like the banana Laffy Taffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people either like love this turp
or they absolutely hate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and that's in like the food world and
in the pot world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but for me, I love it in both.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that candy fake banana
flavor, it's just something I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why more people don't work
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we kind of go through these
phases, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, sometimes it's orange and it's tangy
and everybody's just gravitating towards
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or sometimes it's banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, people like that at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I know when they had that,
it was like a California banana,
[SPEAKER_01]: Chiquita banana or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were loving it at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we go through phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ain't that the truth?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all sort of circular, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just remind me, I totally forgot
about that Chiquita banana thing that you
[SPEAKER_00]: were right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was huge for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's some good insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the other thing you mentioned was
that it was you're on like the solventless
[SPEAKER_00]: hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you fall on the concentrate
flower sort of divide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you more a hash or more a flower sort
of guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you sit?
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, I like I like the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like ever since I was really got turned on
onto it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked a lot of hash when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't like the hash that we have
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like much different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I really got into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the whole Don May line that we
did just before this Bahama line,
[SPEAKER_01]: my whole focus of that line was hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I went out and bought a goddamn
freeze dryer and I turned a whole room
[SPEAKER_01]: into a hash room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care what anybody wants me to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care about runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a shit about anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make a line that all washes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care if they're pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to show that you can breed
functionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can breed something to to do
something specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I hunted down plants that I knew washed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it with the Don, which we knew
washed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just washed all the all the
whole tests and smoked a bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody that gets those those seeds
from that Don line, we're constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: hearing from them about how well they
wash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fun thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I love hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the process of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm by no means an expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm I'm a newbie at best at making hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm right there with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's it's cool to hear that,
like that's sort of how you intentionally
[SPEAKER_00]: did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was sort of wondering that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you sort of answered the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess the next question that makes
me wonder is, do you think eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll get to a point where for a strain to
be commercially viable, it has to wash
[SPEAKER_00]: well, even if it's for flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think there'll just always be a
sort of divide?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, honestly, at least here in
Seattle, I don't see a lot of guys that
[SPEAKER_01]: their whole company is based around
washing strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a couple of them,
I know, like no mids up here and like
[SPEAKER_01]: American hash makers and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not an expert, but I think that it's
just really hard for them to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: money on it, you know, in the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they got to the store has to put
on tack on their money and then the state
[SPEAKER_01]: tax on their tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time they get done,
that gram is so expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The like casual smoker doesn't want to pay
like 80 bucks for a gram of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just don't know how commercially
viable it is, which honestly, to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of keeps it cool because it's like
it's more for the heady, the heady guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like the real.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real the guys are really into those
turps and and smoking the very best.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have to get it from your homeboy
and not go to the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I get you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sort of makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been wondering about that sort of
high and low end divide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just want to jump back to a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you were talking about the runs
and something that I noticed about that
[SPEAKER_00]: was it seemed like you hit the market just
at that perfect timing where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like runs was really hitting its stride
with consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you paired it with,
say, you know, all of the other feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses you made, it just made some
phenomenal results.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is sort of do you feel like
you have to keep your finger on the pulse
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit with the canner community and trying
to time these things perfectly so they go
[SPEAKER_00]: off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it just a sort of a case of trying
to be in the right place at the right
[SPEAKER_00]: time?
[SPEAKER_01]: You definitely do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You definitely need to read the crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know, people aren't really
into hazes right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you just go try to breed like a
whole line of hazes because you love haze,
[SPEAKER_01]: it might not go over as like you want it
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, you can't just breed
because the names sound cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's a lot of breeders out there
that are just like, oh, I got this cut and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's this name and I'm going to throw it
together with this, you know, these cool
[SPEAKER_01]: names and here's some seeds for you to
buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely not how we do things
over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have like our, the way we do
things is I bring that clone, that cut in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody's like, if a homie is like,
oh, this is, you know, so you got to check
[SPEAKER_01]: this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear you give it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see if I really feel like it's
going to work in this lineup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be awesome and not work for this
lineup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't give a shit what the name of
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could care less if everybody's talking
about it and it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not going to work for this line,
like if it wouldn't have worked for that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that wash lineup, even though it has an
awesome name, it's out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so you have to use some of your
own judgment on what you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: accomplish in your project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that should Trump the names of,
of the, uh, of the streams that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, I think we did, you know,
we, we were one of the first people I
[SPEAKER_01]: think to do a runs cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that banana runs really,
you know, caught people's attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I know my homeboy exotic
right after I, right after he saw the
[SPEAKER_01]: runs, uh, the banana runs, he is like,
he reversed it and did a whole lineup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he reversed it and put it to all
of his strains, um, for a whole runs
[SPEAKER_01]: lineup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that thing went crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: People loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after, after those two things,
after you saw the banana runs and then
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's big runs drop, just everybody was
doing the runs crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're just, I think people are
almost over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly had a good run.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old runs, hasn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess the follow-up question for me
is given that you're one for one with your
[SPEAKER_00]: predictions on runs, what do you think is
going to be the next big flavor to hit the
[SPEAKER_00]: scene?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you tell me, man, I have
absolutely, hopefully it's the Bahama
[SPEAKER_01]: mama.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have absolutely no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I'm waiting on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in our circles, we talk about that
kind of stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what's going to be the next like big
hit, like a GMO or like, like a runs or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cause we want to catch that,
that new one that's tight and get it in
[SPEAKER_01]: the stable and grow it and see if the hype
is real.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gary Payton seems to be floating around
and, and, uh, we've grown it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, it's just really hard to say
which, which way the it's going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit unpredictable like that,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: To, to loop back a bit, uh, we actually
did some breeder awards for the year just
[SPEAKER_00]: gone by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it turns out, both James Bean and
myself, who sort of do the awards each
[SPEAKER_00]: year, we, uh, we both voted you as the
sort of breakthrough breeder of the year,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I guess not so much about like your
first year, obviously, but the year where
[SPEAKER_00]: we feel like from a commercial
perspective, things are really sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess, first of all, congrats on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the question is sort of, did you
expect things to really gain so much
[SPEAKER_00]: momentum over the past few years and in
the last year, have you felt like you've
[SPEAKER_00]: really sort of had an upswing in terms of
popularity and people growing your work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, first, I mean, awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for, you know, recognizing,
recognizing me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, uh, the opinions of peers
is huge for me, uh, in the game,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um, no, I, you know, I, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really concentrate on,
on that, on the, on the popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really not about me very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's or, or anything like, it's just the
company, you know, and, and what,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, um, I talked to, I try to answer
every DM, which I probably shouldn't say
[SPEAKER_01]: that because people are going to be DMing
me all their questions like, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, we try to answer every DM,
every question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to comment on anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I see somebody that's growing soul
fire, um, and I'm tagged in that,
[SPEAKER_01]: in that picture, I will, I will stop by,
make a comment on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just try to interact with absolutely
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've done that since, you know,
2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, and I think after it, once having
that rapport with people that you actually
[SPEAKER_01]: give a shit, um, it's, it starts to,
you know, resonate with them, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know, soul fire actually cares,
uh, what we're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, I'm all about the guys that
are in the trenches.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making these strains for the guys that
are in the trenches, not really the guys
[SPEAKER_01]: that are like in big commercial grows and
warehouses and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the recreational market, it's cool
when they grow my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that too, but I'm really here for
the guy that's like growing pot in his
[SPEAKER_01]: garage or growing it in a tent and blowing
out the block and stinking up the
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, that's who I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to comment on their pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to see what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think that it's starting to
build.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, we test our work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we put a lot of thought into what we
put together and, and that, that can show
[SPEAKER_01]: in the, in the end result.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody can guarantee you like,
you're never going to have a her or more,
[SPEAKER_01]: or nobody can guarantee like, you're going
to have the best results ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but if I can, if I can somehow make
you make it, make you a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: confident in what you see or in what
you're going to get or, or lower that
[SPEAKER_01]: chance that you're going to have a her or
a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's what, that's what it's all
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if I can, you know, help you talk to
you and help you, that's what it's all
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's, you know, that's a driving
force.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's helping build our
popularity given a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that sort of customer service
really goes a long way and a testament to
[SPEAKER_00]: the brand image you want to maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we're on the topic of customer
service, let's say you got one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: sneaky DMS and it's someone who's says,
you know, pretty new to growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one strain would you recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the question sort of comes
down to like, without knowing too much
[SPEAKER_00]: about a person's interests, what strain do
you feel you could really get behind and
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend to most people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, when someone, I get that
question all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they, when somebody asked me that
question, I, I have to hit them with a
[SPEAKER_01]: barrage of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of flavors do you like?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much room are we working with?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if we're in a, you know,
we're in a small space, maybe regs aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe FEMS are what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of flavor profiles are we
looking for here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we looking for gas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we looking for fruit?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, I, I have to ask them a bunch
of different questions before I can kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of tailor something for them to grow and
have success with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause ultimately what I want to see is
them have a successful grow and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, put their pictures up on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can be like, damn, you crushed it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like some heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's, it's, it's a hard question
to answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of people ask me in this this
Bahama line, well, which is the best one,
[SPEAKER_01]: which all these pictures look so,
so dope so far, which is the best one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's hard to say what's the best one
because if you like gas, maybe this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: one for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you like fruit, maybe this one,
or if you're looking for weight,
[SPEAKER_01]: that one might be the one for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really, it's really different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I love them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I chose them for this,
this lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look, totally understandable,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the new Bahama mama lines are just
looking so incredibly frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I easily put them in the hype train
worthy category and that I'm excited to
[SPEAKER_00]: see them and to see how they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me wonder, what was it about the
Bahama mama itself that stood out to you
[SPEAKER_00]: and made you think, let's do a line with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's blow it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when I saw it, when I saw the guys
at Rugged Roots growing in, and those guys
[SPEAKER_01]: were amazing growers over there in Maine,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I saw them growing in,
I was like, dude, that thing is black and
[SPEAKER_01]: it has crazy leaf to flower ratio,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we were talking about earlier,
I'm not a huge fan of trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I got better shit to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the least favorite things to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we can get a leaf to fan ratio or a
leaf to flower ratio that's favorable,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first I saw the structure, the color,
the frost, they were nice enough to get it
[SPEAKER_01]: to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I got it, I was like,
okay, we're going to grow this thing out,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, because you got to stick to the
plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that comes in, it doesn't matter
how tight it looked when you were growing
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to grow it, assess it,
smoke it, and then decide if it's worthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just like, oh my God,
this is fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, it looks like he could
literally, I'm not even lying,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like he could go up with like a
little dab tool and just scrape that shit
[SPEAKER_01]: off and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just like, okay, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just killed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just crushed this,
but let me give it to like a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: homeboys and let's see them grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow it, hit me up so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: This shit is crazy right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're kind of have a consensus
like, all right, this thing's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's how it got chose.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, we looked through
probably over a thousand different Bahama
[SPEAKER_01]: mamas over from the time it was released.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we knew the first time we made
Bahama mama, we're like, this thing is
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this strain is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it, it dumps, you know, it's great
for hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful colors, but in so many of
them, and it's not that it's a bad thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but because that chopped cookies in there,
we're getting that tangy smell in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in what I wanted to use for this
lineup, I didn't want that tangy smell and
[SPEAKER_01]: the rugged cut did not have the tangy
smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had like a vanilla icing Hawaiian
punch, hard candy kind of smell completely
[SPEAKER_01]: devoid of orange citrus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that was another factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like, okay, you know,
now we got something unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the color.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the, the leaf to flower ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: The weight was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I washed it because you know, when I,
I was going through my, my, I want to wash
[SPEAKER_01]: everything hash face.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, even for a new,
like me to wash it and they came back like
[SPEAKER_01]: 5.5% or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was me just taking the best of
the best too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not like full spec or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's, I think that's how the
decision came down on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense why you picked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if people haven't seen the photos,
please get over to Sulphi's Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a no brainer, but I sort of hear this
sentiment at times that a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community in terms of like the
connoisseur cannabis community,
[SPEAKER_00]: they complain about, you know,
being burnt out on that tangy turp in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I also realized that there's this
huge part of the market, especially the
[SPEAKER_00]: more sort of casual smokers who definitely
don't share this opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes me wonder, do you think it's
better to cater to the greatest number of
[SPEAKER_00]: customers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you feel like you have some
obligation to sort of the hardcore heads?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for me, I mean, again, this was kind
of like a personal thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the Tangy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not get it misconstrued.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see a lot of our crosses have that,
that TROP in it because I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the extracts that it makes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't want it for this because I
feel like there's already that in the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can go get that from TROP if you
want it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to do something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's and the only way I could
do it is if it wasn't present.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took a long time to find something
that is present.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do I feel like loyalty to any one
group when I'm doing my breeding now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Casual or hardcore, heady guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm just trying to make the very best
that I possibly can make and, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, bring it to the market at a
price point that that anybody can afford
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow us, you know, back to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I love the guys in the tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the home, the home grower that's
breaking it off in their backyard,
[SPEAKER_01]: in their garage or just out in the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so I just try to keep it,
keep it accessible for everybody,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's huge value in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, obviously being in
Australia, I'm one of those people who's
[SPEAKER_00]: like not burnt out on Tropicana cookies at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm totally in the same boat as you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it makes me wonder then,
how would you describe the the Rugged
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain cut itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it very TROP heavy leaning or does it
bring some other sorts of flavors and
[SPEAKER_00]: turps to the table?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it, the, how I explain it is it grows
similar kind of to TROP, but I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's heavier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just jet black and it comes on
kind of late.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when I was growing up,
I was like, I don't know, man,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like, I don't think this is
going to be very heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't, I don't know if it's going to
be very colorful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're like pulling into like week
five and boom, the color show starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts going like, like sunset orange
frosty madness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, it just goes to jet
black.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's just really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like, yeah, flavor wise,
it's just, it's like this vanilla.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a vanilla icing Hawaiian fruit
turp, kind of like a fruity pebbly turp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want the flavor of that to
overpower everything in the, in the
[SPEAKER_01]: lineup, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when I choose the, the one that's
the other side of it, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the other part of the cross,
I want that to kind of shine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I choose some of those for their,
their flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want some of that to shine through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes if you choose something
that's just too dominant, then now it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like the runs thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Runs, beautiful, beautiful plant does
excellent crosses, breeds very well,
[SPEAKER_01]: but makes everything taste like runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does bring this topic to mind for me,
which is that a lot of the casual
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers out there, as I'm sure you're
aware, they're obsessed with like the idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of exotic, you know, everything's got to
be exotic for them to want to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, it raises this fundamental
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is exotic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what makes a strain exotic?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be interested in your perspective
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, it's irritating that exotic,
but I, what I think it is, is one,
[SPEAKER_01]: it has to be an, it has to be an amazing
strain, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to almost be kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Known worldwide, but not able to be
obtained.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has to have some sort of like really
hard to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause once everybody gets it, is it
exotic?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's mundane.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has to be hard to obtain well known,
and it has to be absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the three things it has to be,
to be exotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, that's a good criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've heard a lot of different
answers and it's interesting that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no consensus on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think it was compound who we
had on not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sort of said some many similar
things to you, except he also said,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I also think it's got to be purple to
some extent, which I think was an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting sort of tidbit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess your work sort of fills that
criteria anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I mean, are we saying that we
can't have an exotic strain that's like
[SPEAKER_01]: green?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess we're just not in favor
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand what he's saying that it
needs to have some color to be exotic,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I've seen some of the banana runs,
Finos that are green and are absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: exotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you pop that jar open,
you smell it and you look at how frosty it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if that, if I agree
completely that the colored part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I definitely get, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I, I can't remember who it was,
but someone else threw out an interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it might've even been Masonic,
but someone was like, what about like
[SPEAKER_00]: Acapulco gold?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like that is that like,
that's sort of exotic just by virtue of
[SPEAKER_00]: how hard it is to get, but I digress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could go down a whole rabbit hole with
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but I mean, speaking of exotic,
you notably have a, have a pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: friendship with exotic Mike, as far as I
know, how did that all come about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we go all the way back to like
community college.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been buddies since way before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I would say like brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, we go all the way back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before exotic genetics, the company and,
and, and Soulfire or any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we go, we go back to a community
college.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met in a pre, pre Cal math class.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and we used to take trips down to
Humboldt to see my uncle, who's a farmer
[SPEAKER_01]: down there for obvious reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in, back in the day, we used to make
that run back and forth and we just been
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been friends for a long time,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a organic sort of connection you guys
had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, you've got me interested now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was sort of some of the old school
strains you were smoking on back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day when you were doing those trips?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, back then we were doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were like, Oh, at least that,
like we would go to school and then we
[SPEAKER_01]: would come back and we'd watch like a sub
cool and his old, in his YouTube channel,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were really into like TGA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm cool back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were like smoking the Flav and,
and like a bunch of different,
[SPEAKER_01]: different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I was growing up some cool,
crazy train.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of train wreck was floating
around back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the first award that, that Mike
won, like I had, what was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a grape God.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the, it was a grape God crossed with
the Flav and I want to say, so it was my
[SPEAKER_01]: grape God selection and he took a Flav
male crossed that and won his first high
[SPEAKER_01]: times here in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he got like second place or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like one of my selections,
one of his selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the first time like he won some
shit and that shit was so exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that really kicked off everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, before we move on, I want to
quickly ask you out of personal curiosity,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause I, I too used to watch a ton of the
weed nerd and you know, big up sub cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We miss you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, what's your favorite TGA
strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just, when you mentioned the
Flav, it, it brought all these memories to
[SPEAKER_00]: mind because there's some TGA strains
where you hear a lot about them,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Chernobyl and Space Queen,
but other ones like the Flav have got like
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit of a cult following.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm curious to hear what was your
favorite TGA strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was that like Mike had a really
good cut of the Flav.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we loved growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grew like these eggs all over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it just like these egg shape nugs
all over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just had a crazy smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was talking to him like a month or
two ago and I was like, bro, we need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where, who has that fucking cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, where's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's our Flav cut at?
[SPEAKER_01]: We just don't got it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that, I loved the crazy train just
because of the colors that it put out,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like the smell wasn't,
it was like kind of more of an earthy
[SPEAKER_01]: smell, but the color show that that thing
would put on and the frost for like even
[SPEAKER_01]: back then was like a hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of its time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think those were my two
favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solid picks, solid picks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to follow up on another thing
relating to Exotic Mike, I think it was
[SPEAKER_00]: James Bean who told me that you had been
sort of one of the influential people who
[SPEAKER_00]: had sort of helped get Mike on board with
FEMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, he had tried a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he had used different sprays that
are on the market and he had done
[SPEAKER_01]: different things and they just weren't
working.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like burning up his plants and
they, yeah, they just weren't working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just, you know, I got a background in
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put my, my head in it and I,
you know, I kind of came up with my own
[SPEAKER_01]: little recipe and yeah, I, I made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I, I reversed, I made that banana
runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he kind of helped me get the
timing down because my timing wasn't very
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was a little bit off and you know,
Mike Kennedy was like, man, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this, your reversals are amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, tight, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I showed, you know, I helped him to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he's like, yeah, but we got to
get this timing right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something about Mike that,
you know, he's a really focused in on what
[SPEAKER_01]: he's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was able to like focus in and really
tune our timing down so that we could,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can nail it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I, I definitely helped him learn
how to make FEMS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I pushed him in that direction to make
FEMS because I felt like the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: exotic genetics company was missing that
portion of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to see all my homeboys succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing more I want to see than,
than everybody at the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody knows me, I want to see all my,
my people do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was pushing him on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, look, man, you're just going
to have to make some FEMS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally he was like, all right,
I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and he really helped me get that
timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate it for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's a question we get
regularly from listeners is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the optimal time to pollinate your
harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember back in the day, sub cool
actually was, he would always say,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I think that you want the females to
sort of get hit by the pollen around sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of end of week three, week four sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you fall on that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a, that's, that's about
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: End of week three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so what are we talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like day 28 ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like right around there, I think is the
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it needs to be like nice cotton
balls everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do that, if you do it too early,
you're just going to cheat yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just not going to get as many seeds
as you could.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to watch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've learned a lesson on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jumping the gun a little bit too early on
that, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to have really nice,
nice cotton balls for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So timing is key, especially timing with
your, with your family creation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd have your timing right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've one of those people have been
burnt before and you end up with like a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred seats or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, what happened there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, on the topic of feminized
work, you know, obviously you do a mixture
[SPEAKER_00]: of both regular and feminized work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sort of wondering, do you have any
preference?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a follow-up, do you think it's
easier to make a good feminized cross than
[SPEAKER_00]: it is to make a good regular cross?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's quite true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think from the selection standpoint,
it is a little bit easier to make a good
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized cross because you're looking at
that female plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You already know what it's going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, well, not what it's going to do,
but you know what you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're looking at, you're like,
Oh man, it's got beautiful color.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got all these different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little bit harder to see in a
male plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you select differently with the male
criteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some guys select for like frosty
male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some guys have a bunch of different ways
they select male plants, like stem rub,
[SPEAKER_01]: all those different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you really need that when you're,
when you're reversing a already known like
[SPEAKER_01]: banger?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it might be easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, I mean, you're going to
need to grow out all those fems because
[SPEAKER_01]: people, people seem to say that,
that fems have this reputation for herming
[SPEAKER_01]: easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's kind of gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Science really, I popped a bunch of guys
regular reg seeds that herm all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you, you just answered the next
question for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a follow-up, sometimes you hear
breeders say that they feel using a mother
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes from fem stock is like a bad
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to make seeds,
do you, do you also have a similar point
[SPEAKER_00]: of view where you think that's maybe not
true?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that it's true or not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess that's part of the problem
with where we're at in like cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding, because a lot of it is just
anecdotal, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, Oh, well, this happened to me
this one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this must be the science and me kind of
coming from like a science background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't go, unless it's proven,
I just don't go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so hard to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's guys that reverse fems all
the time and use them in their,
[SPEAKER_01]: in their stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess just as a bit of a far out
question, would you ever consider making
[SPEAKER_00]: like S twos or something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you found a killer, say Bahama mama S
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, I would, I would be open to
try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just have to, it'd have to make
it through the rigorous testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like we'd have to see what that,
what the progeny would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would they come out all weird?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're stacking a lot of genes on
top of each other, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be interesting if you could somehow
get some sort of like ABC or freak show
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of expression out of doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that freak show thing looks crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you, you, you've got me,
you know, on this freak show train now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to ask the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at plants like that and I'm sort of
like, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see the value in it, but I also
don't see the commercial value in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on those weird sorts
of strains?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for me, it's not, I mean, that
particular one isn't something that I
[SPEAKER_01]: would breed with or I would grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I agree with you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just, that's, that's about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, like, uh, we bred with,
with, uh, the creature from, from Beeleaf
[SPEAKER_01]: over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent the, kind of where we grew that
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a weird plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it just like makes these fingers,
it's super frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so it was a little bit odd,
an odd plant, but it wasn't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, I don't even know what the
freak show really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a mutant?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never grown it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen it grown personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've only seen pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like a weird hybrid of Big
Sur, Hollywood and Banana Roji of all
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, pretty weird in genetics in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, take me back to the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the, the very start goes back to
my, my uncle from humble, like just being
[SPEAKER_01]: a little kid and just walking into his,
uh, his grow room and being blinded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I guess I've had a
relationship with it since I could walk,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um, I think in high school,
like in the middle of high school,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just, well, shit, even before
that, I guess I was, I would steal my,
[SPEAKER_01]: my, uh, my cousin's car when we were 13
and go to Yakima and buy, um, Mexican
[SPEAKER_01]: brick weed ounces and smoke with all the,
all the homies back in the early,
[SPEAKER_01]: early nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess there, and then, um,
midway through high school, I was,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I live in a, I live in West
Seattle, White Center area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like the shitty neighborhood
of, of Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back then when we were kids,
I mean, we didn't have any money.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was, I was like a water, a water boy
for, uh, uh, you know, a grow house here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I got, I got a real intimate
relationship with at least taking care of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that was like 94, 94, 95 maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, fuck man, we didn't have
filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have any of that, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like the whole block would
just reek.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was crazy, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, that, and then with breeding,
like those guys that I was watering those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants where they're like older guys,
you know, I got, I was one of those plants
[SPEAKER_01]: where they were doing some breeding back
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then like near the end of high
school, I would, we live really close to
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back then, um, we would drive up to
Canada and you could go to these coffee
[SPEAKER_01]: shops where you could go in the coffee
shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could roll up joints and they sold
seeds there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would go there and I would just buy
all kinds of seeds, enjoy smoking weed
[SPEAKER_01]: inside in a coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I thought that was the coolest shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, then I would smuggle all the
seeds back and we would pop all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different seeds and go through the Finos
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess that's kind of where it
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that sort of like the Mark Emory days
of it all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was definitely the Mark Emory
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool that you got to experience
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you referenced that, you know,
some of the, the more senior guys when you
[SPEAKER_00]: were younger were toying around with
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you happen to remember what they were
working with by any chance?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I mean, everything back then was like,
um, like skunks and like Northern lights
[SPEAKER_01]: and just I mean, I thought that the pot
that we were growing back then was
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we saw it today, I'd probably be like,
Ooh, but, um, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they were, they were, they were
making all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was a wild time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and super illegal, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like back then it wasn't romanticized as
much as it is now, like where nowadays in
[SPEAKER_01]: Seattle, your neighbors don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't, everybody is pro pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, back then it wasn't that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was a, it was a operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, it was a good learning experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I learned a lot watering those
plants and listening to those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of those guys now are,
are in the industry today in the legal
[SPEAKER_01]: industry here in, uh, in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's cool to see them have moved
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always good to see the people who
sort of lay the groundwork initially
[SPEAKER_00]: getting some recognition for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we fast forward a little bit,
when did you decide to get your first sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of grow going in terms of like,
it's yours, you're running it,
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting the genetics and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did that occur?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I mean, we've been growing,
we've been growing since 96 at,
[SPEAKER_01]: at, for different reasons and from then
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So always, I mean, I, I feel like growing
is almost therapeutic for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like church.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's where I go sometimes to think
it's where I go sometimes to just get away
[SPEAKER_01]: from people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and sometimes where I go to,
you know, to have to talk with the homies
[SPEAKER_01]: or, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think that I'll ever not have a
grow in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And growing goes back all the way before,
you know, before 2000 for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It holds a, it holds a place in my heart,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to steal that line from
now on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing is like church for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not very religious myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm pretty agnostic, but, uh,
but there's, there's some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: religious connection from a spiritual
connection, I guess, for me with,
[SPEAKER_01]: with growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if I didn't, if I didn't make a dollar
from it, I'd still be doing it every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you sort of raise an
interesting point when you say that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, even if I didn't make a dollar
from it, I'd still do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sort of makes me think about the
trajectory of someone who's looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: craft themselves out a position in the
industry, maybe as a breeder, maybe as
[SPEAKER_00]: just a grower and having a brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously at some point, everyone
starts off where they aren't getting paid
[SPEAKER_00]: a dollar for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just sort of doing it for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: What might be some advice you'd give to
someone who wants to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of do things in the right way and not
just, you know, sort of cut corners or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your advice for a newbie breeder or
brand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, don't worry about the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, don't, don't do it for the dollars,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's other shit you could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make better money, you know,
um, at least if you're doing it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you see me, I, we don't drop a
strain every day or every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't hear a new strain for me every
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cause the shit takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're doing it right and you're
testing, you're growing everything out the
[SPEAKER_01]: proper way and you're really, um,
doing it the proper way, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no real proper way, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You do it however you want, but this is
the way I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just are able to drop a strain every,
every five minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that shit takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, and time is money, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, don't do it for the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do it because you love doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that show, it'll show in your
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do it, if you're doing it because
you love doing it, because you absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to see that, you know,
we're going to see that in your crosses
[SPEAKER_01]: and you might be surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might love it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's some great information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you gave me a brilliant segue right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember, you know, Chad,
I was having with James Bean last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was telling me that you had a release
sort of scheduled to go live, but sort of,
[SPEAKER_00]: as it was getting close to the day,
you decided to pull the plug because you
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of weren't happy with some of the
results you were seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it raises the question, you know,
what's it like to have to make that call,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and how does it feel to have
done that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what many would say is probably the
honorable thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's how you feel while others in the
industry, you know, has sort of knowingly
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped strains that are just horrible,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, the one that everyone's
probably thinking of is it candy rain from
[SPEAKER_00]: the cookie fam, you know, like they don't
give a shit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so what's it like to have to make
that call and how does it feel when you
[SPEAKER_00]: see that other breeders don't do that sort
of thing when maybe they should?
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it was absolutely easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Easy, easy call to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, we looked at it and we're
just like, and that was, that was the Don
[SPEAKER_01]: Mega cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of crosses in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe with this mail, the mail that we
use, which was awesome, what we thought
[SPEAKER_01]: was awesome mail, we're just seeing too
much, too many problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in some of the, in some of the crosses,
so we're like, we're going to back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to just hold back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the money's not that important.
[SPEAKER_01]: The money's definitely not worth my
reputation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the money's not worth people having
all kinds of issues all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, nah, that's not what we're about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just pulled back off that and then,
and re went, and then re went at that with
[SPEAKER_01]: a different focus, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's when that, when we made
the line with the washing in mind,
[SPEAKER_01]: we came at it with a different mail and
then tested all that stuff again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't see those problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're like, boom, we found it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just emphasizing, you know,
I feel like that's a very honorable thing
[SPEAKER_00]: to do, which you don't really hear a lot
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes me wonder what is
unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this hypothetical I've been
giving to guests on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think it's an interesting sort of
moral dilemma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say you've got a seed line and
like half of the seeds herm, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a very high percentage, like 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the 50% that don't herm is the most
fire thing you've ever seen or created.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do with that line?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, obviously you probably should work
at some more, even if it's, even if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: super fire, but you know what you could,
the one thing you could do is be honest
[SPEAKER_01]: about that and, and tell people like,
Hey, this is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, uh, uh, get it at, at,
at your own risk or, or you could go back
[SPEAKER_01]: to the drawing board and rework that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can take some of those ones that
you found in there and work, work from
[SPEAKER_01]: there out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's a bunch of different things
you can do rather than just drop the shit
[SPEAKER_01]: like 50% that are are actually herms like
intersects from the bottom to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a, that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I get some guys that will say,
you know, Hey, like things herm for a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of different reasons, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like sometimes if it's just on like the
lower, like you see some stuff on the
[SPEAKER_01]: lowers, that could be a bunch of different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one guy could get a plant and it'll
pop out some nuts on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another guy can get the same plant and
grow it just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there's a difference between
problems in your grow room and problems
[SPEAKER_01]: with your tech versus problems with the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got to, if you, if you're testing
some seeds and 50% of those seeds have
[SPEAKER_01]: full blown herms, I don't give a shit what
the other 50% look like you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: probably start over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you raise a brilliant point there sort
of about honesty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like is it, you just be upfront,
just be honest about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it further segues into this discussion
about do we need to test seeds even
[SPEAKER_00]: because we've sort of entered this new
domain of breeding where you've got some
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders like Masonic, for example,
where he's just open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't test my seeds straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it makes you wonder, is it better
to be honest or is it better to test?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that is exactly why I fuck with
Masonic so strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I get people, I did a cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a collab with Masonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used his pie of God and with my Don mega
and my Don mega cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got guys in my DM talking shit to me
because I use Masonic's work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, I don't even get into it
with them, but here's the thing about
[SPEAKER_01]: Masonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy has never lied to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's never, he's told you the truth from
day fucking one.
[SPEAKER_01]: He told you straight up, I'm going to take
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to cross Wilson with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I was listening to him one
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, you know, you can go buy
seeds from some breeders that they do all
[SPEAKER_01]: this testing and they do all this stuff or
you can, you can get these right here,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that, that we made and you can
get these deals on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, I don't know, man,
I just support the honesty and the
[SPEAKER_01]: openness that he brings to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And furthermore, when I popped that,
that papaya God and I grew it out,
[SPEAKER_01]: that shit was tight straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it made it into the line for no
other reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see pictures of people that grow
out the, the Dawn magic wand all the time
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that found it to be heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So props to Masonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, he's an interesting character,
very polarizing, but the thing which I
[SPEAKER_00]: find most interesting is exactly what you
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like people like to hate on him,
but it's really hard to point to anything
[SPEAKER_00]: ethically, so to speak, bad that he's
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause as you said, it's been, it's been so
upfront, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he, he's never lied to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's all I gotta say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like hate on him.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't like his personality or you
don't like his trolling, that's you,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the guy in the, at least in the
breeding, from the breeding standpoint,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's been upfront and he's been honest
with what he's doing the entire time.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of people in my DMS and even
publicly, you know, really upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had him on the show and you know,
this whole get real breeders on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just, I always just thought he's
opening a store.
[SPEAKER_00]: In like Fairfax, like he's obviously doing
something, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, don't you feel like you've got
something you could possibly learn from
[SPEAKER_00]: him?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I, I have popped a bunch of
breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to out anybody or whatever,
but I pop anybody in the game that
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody I've popped their gear and I've
grown it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I w we met at, at the Denver show.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, you know, so fire here's all
these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, bro, this is so many
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't pop all these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me which one of these is a banger and
I will pop that pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, these ones right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These ones are a banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm popping these when I get home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like I said, when I got, when I got
off the plane, I got home, I put out all
[SPEAKER_01]: my different seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I always collect seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't think that I just, I I'm buying
seeds all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get seeds from everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So his went in the, in the, in the group
to get popped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we were going through it,
I was just like, this shit is tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the smell was tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: The frost was tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was like, it just came
together, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, and there was a few of
them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there was a couple of keepers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, yeah, this is some heat
period.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I made it in the lineup.
[SPEAKER_01]: No other reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it shows in the, like the progeny with
that Dawn, like it crossed really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It washed awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, there was a, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also referenced that one when we're
interviewing him and he said it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we take a step back and look at the
mail, we've spoken about it a few times,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Dawn mega it in itself was,
you know, what I can consider to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty successful commercial release.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it about the Dawn mega that stood
out to you and how would you describe the
[SPEAKER_00]: turps and sort of flavors it brings to
crosses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, that, that came around
like it, so it's a GMO cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, right off the bat,
you're going to get those funky turps,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of like a funky Jim sock
corpse plant, nasty funky turp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you got to kind of be into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then.
[SPEAKER_01]: The commercial guys, like the,
the rec growers really liked it because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting this funky turp.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting a high THC test score.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most of the keepers are testing
around 30, 30 plus, and they're just
[SPEAKER_01]: weighing super heavy and they're finishing
before 65.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of like a trifecta for
those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: The guys that want to make money and they
have like these, this like little box
[SPEAKER_01]: criteria that they need to stay in to be
able to hit these numbers for their
[SPEAKER_01]: investors or just to stay open in a market
that's overly taxed and overly regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and it washes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I think, you know, that comes from
the GMO and probably the black banana
[SPEAKER_01]: having that Blackberry Kush in the
background, which is also a good washer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it just checked a lot of boxes
for people commercially.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's why it was really popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's if you're like a home grower,
it might not be the one for you because
[SPEAKER_01]: that thing gets so tall and gnarly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if, if ceiling height is like a
thing for you then, and the vigorousness
[SPEAKER_01]: of it too, it'll, it'll overshadow other
shit in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll just crowd them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, would you have a specific cross
you might recommend that has the Don mega
[SPEAKER_00]: in it that is maybe a little more sort of
indoor timeable or would you just say,
[SPEAKER_00]: stay away from the F2s?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's sort of the more vigorous
lanky one you referenced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The F2 super vigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like the, the happy hour is a great
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the Scorpion crew, those guys out
of Spain, they've won, they've won some
[SPEAKER_01]: competitions with that and extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a nice strawberry with that
raunchy turp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stays a little bit shorter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's a really good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I was going to do, if I wanted a Don
mega cross and something indoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's probably what I would go with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, as we wrap up on the Don mega
quickly, I'm just wondering, will we,
[SPEAKER_00]: will we see it show its head again,
or are you just sort of always moving
[SPEAKER_00]: forwards?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to, I like to move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes if something's like really
popular and people are just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we need, come on, do some,
bring it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, you know, we'll consider it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think part of like going back to
that, we're talking about exotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's cool for things to go
extinct, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the banana runs, we're probably going
to let that run its course and be done at
[SPEAKER_01]: some, you know, because then when you have
that pack in your vault and we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: making it anymore, it's extinct.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: That value goes up kind of like a baseball
card.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's part of the culture
with seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is what makes it cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds are not going to be as cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's huge companies making so many
of them, it's like, you know, celery and
[SPEAKER_01]: watermelon seeds or whatever that you can
buy at Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're never going to run out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be the exact same.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is boring to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's much cooler if things
become rare or, or gems that you just
[SPEAKER_01]: can't find anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely feel that's got some value to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before we move on too much,
I did want to actually quickly ask you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you referenced the happy hour,
the strawberry jelly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That grabbed my attention because you can
find so little information on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it might be one of Mike's strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us any backstory on that one
at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the strawberry jelly actually is a,
is a cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cut of mimosa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very unique cut of mimosa,
where if you've grown mimosa, it kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: has like a citrusy orange smell generally,
but this one did not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was given to Mike at a show by a
guy named Pure Mel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mike recognized it right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, Oh, this is, this might be
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he just had the flower, you know,
and then pure melt brought Mike the cut
[SPEAKER_01]: and Mike gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, Hey man, grow this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, all right, just like anything
else that comes into our crew,
[SPEAKER_01]: shit gets to be grown out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the number one rule comes in,
I grow it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing it with a bunch of different
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I got, I got some of cap stuff
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got, I got the creme de menthe from Mike
in there, which was kicking ass,
[SPEAKER_01]: like just doing amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had this strawberry plant and
it was wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember I was like, it was day 52
finished frosty as hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a green plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more on the green side of everything,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like a little bit of pink on the
under leaves, but overall green and just
[SPEAKER_01]: super like dense and frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what the real kicker, like the,
what grabs you is the super fake
[SPEAKER_01]: artificial strawberry smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never smelled anything like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've, I've grown strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown a bunch of different strawberry
crosses all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I called him up and I was like,
you know, X, what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, the strawberry plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the real deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, he, and he grew it in this
facility and boom, he made strawberries
[SPEAKER_01]: and cranes.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of different strawberry crosses,
all bangers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like look at his red pop line with that
heaters.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a, that's a cool little
backstory on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have expected that out of my
most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I've seen was like what you
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So orange dominant, but sort of you
touched on the idea of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: testing stuff and it we've seen a bit of a
move in the past few years from breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: having like public testers and admittedly,
you know, sometimes getting a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrated because you, you know,
you don't get back all the reviews and the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow reports that you're hoping to get to
sort of more of an in-house testing
[SPEAKER_00]: format.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you test things and do you like to
have external testers or do you just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it in-house?
[SPEAKER_01]: We just do it in-house right now,
but I'm thinking about, well, here's what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing's better than you doing it
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when I test something myself,
one, I can talk about it to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if somebody, if somebody hits you up
and you've used all these different
[SPEAKER_01]: testers and they hit you up on Instagram,
they're like, Hey, how does the Hody doe
[SPEAKER_01]: grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you don't know how the Hody doe
grows because your testers know how it
[SPEAKER_01]: grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that for me is problematic right off
the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that you can't talk about your
own strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know guys do it for whatever reasons and
it just bugs me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to be able to be able to have a
long drawn out conversation about exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: how it grows, what the phenols look like
that I found, how they smell, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you everything about my strains
because I grew them before you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a tester.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew them before I ever thought about
selling them to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can have whatever discussion you
want to have about the plant and I can
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully give you an informed answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should be able to, because I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, that said though, I,
we kind of want to open up a, a testing
[SPEAKER_01]: program at Soulfire.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put an application on our website,
um, for it to take in some testers,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe like a 30, but they have to be
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I look at your pics,
they have to be that dope that you could
[SPEAKER_01]: be accepted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be a high bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those things that they test,
um, would probably, I'm thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: just doing it with one line, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then taking these applications,
picking say 30 testers and then dropping a
[SPEAKER_01]: line and calling it, you know,
and labeling it community tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe they'll have a different price
point, like a little bit lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause obviously I'm not doing that work,
which is vital.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and just trying that one time,
not an all the time thing, but maybe one
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have this community tested line drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be cool as like an
interaction thing, but outside of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: nah, I'm testing everything myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense for a variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially for getting, you know,
high quality photos of the end result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something which I think you,
along with a few other people really excel
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's anything we've learned from
our chats with James Bean in the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the good photos sell packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I'm sort of wondering,
how much focus do you place on getting
[SPEAKER_00]: good photos and what sort of a setup do
you use to get these photos?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using like a DSL, like a high end
sort of camera or just like good quality
[SPEAKER_00]: phone?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just use my iPhone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use my iPhone to take the, uh,
the pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do, you know, I'll just go into
like 4k mode or whatever and just snap a
[SPEAKER_01]: picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, yeah, I have a DSL camera
and I bought like this pad ass DSL camera
[SPEAKER_01]: and Mac roll lenses and all this shit,
but honestly, there's so many different
[SPEAKER_01]: settings on there and like different
apertures and F stops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, I need to go back to
college to take another course on how to
[SPEAKER_01]: use this damn camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I take the pictures with the
camera, they don't come out any better
[SPEAKER_01]: than my iPhone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just stick to the iPhone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's sort of like good and bad at
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's good that you can just use your
iPhone, but it sucks that anyone who's got
[SPEAKER_00]: really good cameras, it might not be given
them that much better results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do want to touch on your days at
university, but I just want to squeeze in
[SPEAKER_00]: one question first, which is sort of
related to the photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen a lot of people getting a lot
of photos taken down by Instagram and some
[SPEAKER_00]: people even having their pages banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess what's sort of more notable is
that this is occurring even in the case
[SPEAKER_00]: where like, like yourself, your legal
business operating in a legal state just
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't really make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think this is a problem we as a
community have to sort of address somehow?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think might be a solution?
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of it is got competition and
guys telling on each other for whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that part of it is I don't even get me
started on that part of it is despicable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think until there's like some
federal legislation, this is going to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why is it going to keep happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Instagram wants to get paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, let's just be real.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're not getting paid on cannabis
guys marketing their stuff on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't sell you little ads.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't legally help you sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, they're trying to bully us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's basically what it is until
they are able to make their money because
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram is not free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, social media has been around long
enough just because they let you use that
[SPEAKER_01]: app.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing's free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like your time, your data, what you look
at them using the algorithm to track you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that stuff is how they get paid for
that app.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of like a free ride for
cannabis guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't get any money from us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So until they do, I think we're going to
be in for this, you know, the persecution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think that, you know,
we see the rise of alternative social
[SPEAKER_00]: media platforms focus for cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think they'll take off or do you
think ultimately Instagram will just
[SPEAKER_00]: change its rules and try to become
profitable off us?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think ultimately Instagram will change
its rules and try to become profitable off
[SPEAKER_01]: of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've popped into some of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've popped into burner's like social club
thing when it was up and instantly popped
[SPEAKER_01]: right out because there was some crazy
shit on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I commend him for trying,
you know, for trying to to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: different way because he was obviously
sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of having his account taken down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he probably wasn't really ready
for how much like you have to do to have
[SPEAKER_01]: one of those apps up and, and police it
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think we're just stuck with
Instagram for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see a way out, but I will say I
did pop over to Capuletors bean basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's kind of brought back that like
forums thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I just kind of lurked
through there and was reading some of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the grow journals and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought those, you know,
it was pretty cool, you know, like I read
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the guys that grew up banana runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw banana runs on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, okay, let me check this guy's
journal out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his journal was so detailed from like,
they, they do it from the, the start of
[SPEAKER_01]: the seed pop all the way to the end of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not, it's obviously not
Instagram where everybody's there and like
[SPEAKER_01]: liking and da da da, but much more like
intimate with the, the whole grow process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, if, yeah, if you're into
that kind of thing, you should pop over
[SPEAKER_01]: and check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I thought it was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess we don't really see a lot
of like dedicated grow journals and with
[SPEAKER_00]: the very nature of like the, the feed that
just flies by it's sort of hard to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: on Instagram in a sense, but yeah,
it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I guess it makes me wonder,
you know, do you think those forums will
[SPEAKER_00]: ever take off or it's more of a side thing
for like the, the hard cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, it's the side thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the hard course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think here's where I think things are
going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think everything's going to go to
discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a, we have a big discord following
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not big, I guess we got like a
thousand guys or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Masonic has his own discord,
but yeah, discord is where it's at because
[SPEAKER_01]: we can do all those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're auctioning packs of seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're auctioning, you know, things that
are hard to get from myself and from other
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're able to give you that
one-on-one, like you can ask questions
[SPEAKER_01]: directly to me or to other team members.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's moderators in there making sure
it's, you know, there's nobody in there
[SPEAKER_01]: saying things they shouldn't or posting
things they shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think like, if you're in this
game right now, you should be looking to
[SPEAKER_01]: move your people also to discord,
because if your Instagram goes down,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least you have your community there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone go, go jump on the discord for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to join as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you should.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're giving away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stopped doing the giveaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we do a lot of giveaways on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stopped doing those on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just do them in discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we try to do like a giveaway every
week where you just interact with the
[SPEAKER_01]: little emoji that you see the giveaway
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it just randomly picks who wins
and then we congratulate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have like, you know, we could see,
we could do the image that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we put up your images or you can show your
grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can ask all kinds of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a plant problem, you take a
picture of the plant, put it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys are right there, you know,
to assist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like a mix of like,
almost like Instagram forums and like chat
[SPEAKER_01]: all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, let's just jump back a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you mentioned how you had your first
grow going and you're growing things like
[SPEAKER_00]: TGA and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering at that time, before you had
really got the ball rolling on your own
[SPEAKER_00]: breedings, were there any specific
breeders who you sort of really looked up
[SPEAKER_00]: to or who you felt you learned the ropes
from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, obviously I, I learned a lot
from, from watching those TGA videos and
[SPEAKER_01]: then the homeboys from here in White
Center growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they didn't know what they were
doing at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just doing things just for seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's no reason to do it except for
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then just Mike, you know,
like being around Mike while he was taking
[SPEAKER_01]: off, like he started exotic and I went to
university and just being around that the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of times we joke that our style
of growing, I watched a lot of Kung Fu
[SPEAKER_01]: movies as like a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's almost like a Kung Fu style,
you know, there's a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_01]: ways to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of different ways to do
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't, none of them are wrong
per se, but in our crew, we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: specific style that we grow and yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's cool to be part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool to, to be in a group of
individuals that, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's got his big facility now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know he uses a trellis and shit,
but I know he misses staking up all those
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's part of our, that's part of
our, our, our style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like staking up everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see it in our pictures a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use bamboo stakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think being around him being
around, I mean, he's a giant in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can't deny him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just all the things I've learned from
him and the people around us, I think
[SPEAKER_01]: really shaped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, you sort of referenced it in some
prior answers, but I'd love to know a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more, you know, like you went to
university and you did a bachelor of
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's impacted on your growing and
your breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's sort of beneficial and
something you might recommend others sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of look into if they're interested?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went to the university of Washington
here in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a, it's an amazing public
university is one of the best in science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's number one for family medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's top notch as far as, as far as
universities go, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: go dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I graduated with my bachelor's of science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I wouldn't say that it like
really helps my breeding, like a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of what it did is it gave me like a
way to think it rounded me out for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like as a, as a person, I feel like being
in those groups and working through
[SPEAKER_01]: problems and failing, failing fucking O
chem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And going back and like doing it again,
you know, it just, it, it really brings
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that resolve to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're not going to quit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to, you're going to do this
shit regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, dude, I'm, I'm just a kid from the
hood, man, from a broke ass part of a
[SPEAKER_01]: town, you know, just raised by my,
by my mom, brothers in the fucking,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got, I have kids too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to show them like,
Hey man, you know, I, if I can do this,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can pass O chem, you can,
you can definitely pass O chem.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can pass genome, you can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved learning that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that it helped helps me be a
better breeder, except it helps me to
[SPEAKER_01]: solve problems, not quit and just like
really stick to like a protocol.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's what I learned in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked under, I think some of the most
brilliant minds in plant biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I worked in a, in a plant lab with
this professor Takedo, this Japanese guy
[SPEAKER_01]: from the university of Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just so smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were doing tissue culture and like
what, hopefully I can talk about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure they already released their
paper, but they were working on the
[SPEAKER_01]: circadian clocks of Arabidopsis and able
to, to make them better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Better pollinators or get pollinated
better by moths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just super interesting,
you know, like, like what they were doing
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to learn a lot in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the lady above us was like even
doing cooler stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like she was genetically engineering
plants to be able to have stomas on the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottoms of the leaves, like add them or
remove them, which I mean, that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can make a plant not lose water
as quickly and could like, you could grow
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe corn and like a much more arid area
or desert or something and they wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: die.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, I love the university.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved my time there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud of myself for, for graduating
and sticking it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when people ask me like, you know,
should I go there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I go there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say you should just go there
because of the experience and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and what you'll learn about yourself
and about how working with other people
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and, you know, how science works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I loved physics too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I just loved the whole thing.
Really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you felt like it was,
it was beneficial and likewise encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone, you know, get amongst it,
get yourself a bachelor of science.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into it, it sort of makes me
wonder, how does it feel to have this sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of very formal scientific background and
yet to be on Instagram at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you, you look at other
growers and you sometimes see some highly
[SPEAKER_00]: questionable slash maybe even pseudo
science about maybe growing or just in
[SPEAKER_00]: general, you know, do you just have to
sort of ignore it at times or what's your
[SPEAKER_00]: take?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got to bite my tongue sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I just, I don't like the bro science.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where, because you saw something maybe
happen one time in your garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: that does not make it a scientific fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually like, you know,
I just, it irritates me, but I just leave
[SPEAKER_01]: it to what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're all, doing the best we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, this is mostly a game of,
of selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a lot of art to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and the scientists really
haven't got in the game yet and I'm a
[SPEAKER_01]: little nervous for when they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now this is more akin to breeding
dogs than it is to, you know, genetically
[SPEAKER_01]: engineering a plant to be the very best
plant on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which they can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's art to me more than it's like
this hardcore science where people are,
[SPEAKER_01]: people are paying for the art.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are paying for your eye,
for your selection, and then for your,
[SPEAKER_01]: your work, making sure that that your,
your selection and your eye comes through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I look at these guys more or less
artists than I do as scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, look, you raised a brilliant
discussion there in that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like fundamentally, do you think that
breeding is more of an art than a science
[SPEAKER_00]: in the sense that do you think one day
we'll be able to like program a computer
[SPEAKER_00]: to be like a better breeder than a human?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think it'll always have a sort
of an element of like that feeling you get
[SPEAKER_00]: when an experienced breeder like looks at
a certain planet is like, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's, I think it's art and
you know, maybe a computer, maybe the
[SPEAKER_01]: crisper will come into play at some point,
but now right now I think it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's completely art.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even in this last, in this Bahama
mama lineup, I did a, a collab with a
[SPEAKER_01]: local graffiti artist named creature
panic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, I didn't even know the guy,
you know, I just, anytime I walk outside
[SPEAKER_01]: my house in West Seattle white center,
we got a lot of graffiti around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always see this like squiggly bear
graffiti and it's fucking everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's on a fence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on an overpass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up on science.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to the point where like, when I'm
driving around or when I'm with the homies
[SPEAKER_01]: or with my kids or someone like,
oh, there, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another, another bear.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another bear over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tracked the guy down on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found some other graffiti artists.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, who the hell is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: They finally, I finally found them and I
hit them up and I was like, Hey man,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to, you want to do some a box art
collab?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I really enjoy your,
the bear that I see everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it kind of fucking makes me
happy when I see it for whatever weird
[SPEAKER_01]: reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, hell yeah, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he did the box art and then we,
we have a sticker for that's in there of
[SPEAKER_01]: that bear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if you get that strain this
month, I don't even know how many of them
[SPEAKER_01]: we sold quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to buy a can of spray paint for
him for every box that we sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I'm going to pull up in my truck
and give him this pallet of spray paint so
[SPEAKER_01]: he could fuck Seattle up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and, and the reason I did
that is because in that box of seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get two pieces of art from Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the soul fire art, which is in my
seeds and you get that little,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that graffiti art from creature
panic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just cause I feel like,
you know, it's breeding and graffiti are
[SPEAKER_01]: just two subcultures of, of Seattle or of,
of American art, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeding and, and graffiti.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's just two forms of art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, thanks for bringing that up because
I was going to ask about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, you saved me the effort and that's
really cool to hear that you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, collaborating with other
artists, even in a sort of less than
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was hoping to ask you, do you have
any other of these sort of more
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting, slightly left of field
co-labs like, you know, shoe co-labs,
[SPEAKER_00]: like stuff like that, or even just the
more standard ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeder, breeder, co-labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we expect in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I, I love doing, I love working with
other breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if, if it's tight, you know,
I love doing that and definitely going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have some more co-labs that are outside of
the realm of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't know exactly what they are
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they, they got to fit with what
we're doing and they got to have a purpose
[SPEAKER_01]: in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just really worked well with creature
panic because you know, these guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: these graffiti guys, man, they're going
out there and they hang their ass on the,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and they don't get anything for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do it for the culture, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they do it for, they do it for
the love of the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I do what I do too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it because I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I recognize that and I loved his
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had it, I had to track him down and
get down with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a cool backstory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fill me in.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did Soulfire as a brand officially
start?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the first sort of project you
did?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you were like it's time to launch
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was the black banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're, it was like 2015,
2016 right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, back then we could still go to shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were just doing the whole show
circuit, just shaking hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, picked up an award out in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Michigan props to the Mitten.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that state.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the growers out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great concentrates out there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what launched it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, just people loved.
[SPEAKER_01]: The line that's where the Don Mega came
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: The work was all very, very stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it just kind of took off from
there, you know, like I said, just talking
[SPEAKER_01]: to absolutely everybody who, who grew our,
grew our strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed the brand has like the
slogan arise with the Phoenix and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: cool slogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see a lot of brands with slogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that sort of mean to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And where did the name Soulfire itself
come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so Soulfire kind of came from,
uh, Mike and I had a glass shop in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in, uh, Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were selling like, uh, bongs and
shit for a while there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that was the name of our,
our glass shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just kind of stuck with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came up with it for the glass shop and
then, and then the slogan, which wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the glass shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it, uh, it just kind of the Phoenix,
you know, represents rebirth anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what better of an icon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, than that for like a seed company,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause every one of those seeds is
potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every one of those seeds is rebirth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where the Phoenix part of it
came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rise with the Phoenix is just kind
of like, you know, our ethos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's just kind of how we think,
like you're, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want you to rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want you to do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our whole goal is to see you crush it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing makes me happier than to have
somebody hop in the DM, show me their
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and be like, Soulfire, look at this
crazy shit I just grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I, you know, I love that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I basically live for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, then that's rising with the
Phoenix, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I see that, uh, or see people
happy because of, um, the genetics are
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's where that came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's so cool to know that you
had like this glass shop and that it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of even further intertwined back with
Mike than what at least I previously knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, dude, it was a nightmare, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: The glass shop was like in the,
uh, so like I said, our neighborhood right
[SPEAKER_01]: here, white centers, rough neighborhood as
far as Seattle goes, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's just a nightmare, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people are fucking breaking in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're having all these problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually we had to shut it down,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just can't let you have nice shit,
but, uh, it was, uh, it was a fun time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I'm sure you were smoking lots
of cool stuff back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any old school cuts that you
have particularly fond memories of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe ones you can't get access to
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, what's some of the ones you
would love to get back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, well, obviously the flave,
like we missed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a, a grape God that smelled like it
was very similar to how that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that strawberry jelly is where it had like
this fake grape smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm constantly searching for
like a fake grape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, um, you know, I think I have some,
uh, Bloomco's, um, grape cream or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to pop some of those or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grape something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to pop some of those and go
through, uh, some of his work because I
[SPEAKER_01]: see a lot of his stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that and blueberry, like we used to
have this blueberry cut that would,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was a super, it was like a bitch to
root.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't seem to ever get up that blueberry
smell or it's just not that popular
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I used to like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess that if I had to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, is that, does that happen to be the
one that Mike used a few times or he had
[SPEAKER_00]: some crosses where it was like,
Oh, that's a, that's an old blueberry and
[SPEAKER_00]: that you don't really see it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that maybe related?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is the cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he, he had a really, we had a really
good blueberry back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know he used it in some of his
crosses, like in the early works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and yeah, it's just gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's kind of like the story,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we have these sometimes amazing cuts
that we wish we still had like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that flave and the grape God.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, there's a lot of them really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm keen to chat about some of your
releases that have come out, but before we
[SPEAKER_00]: do that, I want to quickly glance to the
future for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's on the horizon for Soulfire?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the next big project you're looking
to sink your teeth into?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, I've, I've already kind of
started to formulate, uh, the next
[SPEAKER_01]: project, but I don't want to talk about it
too much yet until we're, until we're
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I think maybe that community,
uh, testing that community project,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that might be something coming up
where if I can iron it out, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to do something like that because
I have so much fun testing our stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be fun to do like some sort of
interactive, like where we send them out
[SPEAKER_01]: to our, our few testers and they,
they run them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it, it wouldn't be like
something that we do all the time or I
[SPEAKER_01]: just don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, a community test project.
[SPEAKER_01]: That that would be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a lot of stuff coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really just takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes, we just, people would say that
all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: When's your next drop or when,
when is that new stuff going to come?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or banks are like, where's the drops at
bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, Hey, don't, don't rush it,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we don't do it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, look, if we go back, I was looking
at the banana fire cookies from relentless
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that you used initially to do the
black banana cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was sort of curious as to what was
it about those genetics that drew you to
[SPEAKER_00]: it initially and thought, you know,
let's make a line using this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it just, it had that banana smell
to it, but it had the cookie structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just drawn to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were talking about that banana
smell early.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I was like, I like this,
you know, I, you know, I loved it and I,
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit them up and I asked permission,
um, to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and he said, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, it just checked all the boxes and
then, uh, I went through all the progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew out all the progeny before I landed
on that, the, the black banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was quite a bit of, um,
I would say testing and second guessing
[SPEAKER_01]: and OCD perfection.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tends to mire me down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes some things that may be awesome
to some people will just get thrown out by
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Oh no, I don't like it, but it was
actually awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just a personal problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, a problem I think many of us have
faced before.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you, when you bred the F twos of the
black banana, was there any specific
[SPEAKER_00]: traits you were looking to sort of hone in
on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I was trying to narrow it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: To try to bring that gene, the genes down
a little bit and narrow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, um, because I was using,
you know, a strain from relentless,
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to release the F ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have all the F ones from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I wanted to have it be my own,
you know, a step further in my own
[SPEAKER_01]: selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why you can only get black
banana F two.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you'll never get the F one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that sort of like a concept?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think you'll use going forward or
more just in this case, it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, just in this case, because,
you know, I used his work, even though he
[SPEAKER_01]: gave permission, I didn't want to just
take his mail and cross it with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and then release it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I wanted to take it the next step of,
of my own selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, when you're looking to select
a male for the next generation of
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, are there any particular traits
that you look for or think are,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, sort of synonymous with a
good quality male?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, there's a bunch of different,
I mean, I have a checklist of things I go
[SPEAKER_01]: through on a male and before it's like the
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really, uh, there's just a lot of
different things, you know, the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: structure, the way the plants lining up,
uh, you know, I've heard some guys talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about reversing a male to see what it
looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never done that personally,
but I want to, I think it'd be interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that I think that'd be hugely cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, I mean, it sort of gets us to this
place where we normally ask the growers
[SPEAKER_00]: about what style of growing they do,
but you're so very transparent on your
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably easily known by most people
listening, but for the sake of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: if anyone hasn't checked out your
Instagram, what style of growing do you
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, do you have any tips on,
you know, how people can get the best
[SPEAKER_00]: results out of growing your strains?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, and this is, you know,
kind of going back to our our style,
[SPEAKER_01]: we use, um, we use pro mix HP for the
medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like an inert dirt,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a soil that doesn't really have
nutrients or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like kind of repeat based,
uh, with a little bit of perlite and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I don't add it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just comes like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I love that medium one because it's
not too water lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't, it lets me get that water and
get the nutrients in and it just doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the water for too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it allows me to pound them,
um, if I need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I use that and then size of pot,
it just varies depending on what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I like to give my plant structure
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like in my pictures, you may notice
that I, I use bamboo stakes, which is,
[SPEAKER_01]: can be a bitch when we're talking about
hundreds of plants, but, uh, that's how,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how I like to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, then as far as nutrients, uh,
I use house and garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used house and garden for ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm over a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're amazing nudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I think it makes, uh, I'll see a guy
grow with something else and I'll be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, why don't you just go ahead and use
house and garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's how I use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how I use it is exactly how they have
on the, um, on their little feed scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't go aggressive, but,
uh, I just use the house and garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use, uh, the aquaflakes with my,
for the A and B part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and this last run, it was,
uh, the guys from power SI or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: they sent me some, and I saw the hype
around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you know, I'll give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shit was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I didn't have to bring in those
bamboo stakes till way later in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I, I really saw a benefit from
using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times guys will send me products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give them a shot and I just don't see
any change.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, not going to use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use things that I see a direct
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and in house with house and garden,
you can, you can see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you hit week six and you use
their shooting powder, I tell guys this
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time, you use their shooting
powder, you go in your room the next day,
[SPEAKER_01]: you see a change, like a marked change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, I can't say, say enough good
things about house and garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I really liked the power,
power SI, I think is how you say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, other than that, this was my first run
with LEDs, really impressed, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might never go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's about it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you what, you've now got me
wondering, is it power SI or what would
[SPEAKER_00]: the alternative be like power C?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's, I mean, they're using
a pure periodic table for silica,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it, do you just call it power
silica?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but great guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they, they, they, uh, sent me,
so they hit me up and they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you want to give us the shot?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, they sent it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me a long time to, um,
to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I was like making seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't want to use it while I was
making seeds because there's really
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing to, to show or see or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they didn't like hit me up like,
Hey, are you using that stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they didn't bug me or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, then I told them,
I was like, you know what, I'm gonna,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna use it for this test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just stay tuned and we'll see,
you know, we'll see how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, my buddy, Ms. Jackson Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw him using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw, uh, Cush forest over in Boston
using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just like, yeah, man,
let's go, let's go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, an ongoing discussion we have
on the show is organic and non-organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like the style of growing you
use ultimately affects the end product in
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that it's sometimes made out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that like I'm a diehard sort of
organic guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I also recognize that at like the
very pinnacle, I, it can get hard to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to see the difference though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like organic, I guess, at the end of the
day, do you feel like if you grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: well-grown product, it makes a difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think there's like a bit of bias
from people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think there's, I think as long as
you, as long as you have a well-grown
[SPEAKER_01]: product, I think you're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think people bring in their own
biases.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've ever went to like a grow store
or whatever and like waited in line and
[SPEAKER_01]: like four or five different people will
give you different advice on what is the
[SPEAKER_01]: best thing in the world to use.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, you know, it's to each their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of different ways to get
to the finish line.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a, and that doesn't make any one
of them the right way or the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, we're all from different,
uh, we're all from different dojos.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all from different styles,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We all have our style.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have the crouching tiger style.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have the crane style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it, it doesn't, it doesn't change it
one bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I've smoked organic and I thought it was
tight and I definitely like mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, it could be, yeah, everybody has
their own biases, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it makes sense, makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we move now onto some of your work,
I mean, many of your strains are very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting for a variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one that grabbed my eye was the
green, which you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little Valley OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I was particularly interested
in the little Valley OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never heard of it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any backstory on it and what's it
sort of like on its own?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the little Valley OG came to me from,
um, my homeboy Duke over in Yakima.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Yakima is a small town over on the East
side of Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Washington is kind of divided by this
mountain range where over in Seattle on
[SPEAKER_01]: the Western side, it's kind of rainy and.
[SPEAKER_01]: More, I don't know, Northwesty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on, Oh, and the other side of
that mountain range is more like desert
[SPEAKER_01]: and hot over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, my, my, my homeboy lives over
there and he's always telling me about
[SPEAKER_01]: this, this, uh, OG plant they got over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he, he had came over to our side
for, for a night and we're playing
[SPEAKER_01]: dominoes and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I smoked some and I smelled some
and I was like, Oh, that is like old
[SPEAKER_01]: school, like OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that shit is tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and bring it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring me three of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to grow them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: My homeboy's name is Duke.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, okay, I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he brings them over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow them out and it's like,
it's got that structure, that stick and
[SPEAKER_01]: ball OG structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that just that smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, this is gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is real gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't really know what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they don't, they just know it
was like the OG that they love.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just called it little Valley OG
because it didn't really have a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're from a little Valley over
there in Yakima.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so shout out to the five Oh nine and
in Yakima Duke and, and to the little
[SPEAKER_01]: Valley OG, which is one of the gaseous
strains I've probably ever come across.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, I think everyone has a
few OGs that they've tried throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, if only I knew which one
that was right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're so like they're mysterious,
but like these guys over there in that
[SPEAKER_01]: area, they like that flavor profile,
um, much more than like fruit and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I got them some packs of like,
uh, trap, trap cookies maybe back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, yeah, we don't like this
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like perfume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like where's the OG at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just old school gangsters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, they don't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want that fucking gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well musty mojito.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another interesting strain where
you use the grim bastard OG as the male in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess, you know, seeing as we're
sort of discussing it, where does OG fit
[SPEAKER_00]: in the arsenal for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like are you a big fan of the
gas and do you like to breed with OG?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I am a fan of the gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're kind of, it's kind of
getting harder to find as we get all these
[SPEAKER_01]: poly hybrids and especially with like
this, like everything crossed with gelato,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I don't know if anybody's tired of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of, I try to limit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like if you look at this line,
there's not a whole lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever we, whenever we sit down to
create a lineup, we try to make it
[SPEAKER_01]: diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like if you look at any of them,
there'll be a little bit of gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll maybe try to slip a lemon in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll try to slip some different fruits in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to make the menu diverse because
who wants to sit down at a restaurant and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's just nothing but meatloaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, okay, like meatloaf is good one day,
but not all the days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, or maybe no days, depending if you
don't like meatloaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to keep that menu diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there'll be a gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there'll be a, you know,
a gelato, but not the whole damn thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's kind of the
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something for everybody, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another strain I wanted to flag was
you've worked with the Northern Fire
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies, which one that comes from a buddy
of the show, The Northern Fire,
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it about this cut that you like
and how would you describe some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids you've made with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the, I'm going to pronounce it wrong,
but is it the NF Sheesh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you got to say it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's NF Sheesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the NF Sheesh came out awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that thing is so frosty and that's
why I love using the North Fire's cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to North Fire, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a great grower and you know,
we appreciate him letting us use that
[SPEAKER_01]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's just a banger, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it has beautiful structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It washes very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a good smell on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it breeds well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I think Cap did the El
Norte with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done a couple with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really, I think with the Bahama
together, I mean, it is so frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you look at some of those
pictures, it is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it came out well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might just try to bang off some of the
ones that I was personally curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll just get them all done in one
segment, but the Mando was another
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting cross because it used a mother
called Yoda.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had me wondering, is that related
to the baby Yoda we see from compound
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another one that we just don't
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that got slipped out of a warehouse
or out of a wreck in LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't really say a bunch about,
you know, where it came from per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, he just was like, hey,
grow this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, you know, super gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to grow this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got it back to Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew it out because he doesn't know
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm definitely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just in the pool of things until it
makes the cut to even go to the next
[SPEAKER_01]: phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and when I grew it out, I was like,
oh, yeah, this is tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like this is gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the frost on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the structure of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of had like this almost like oh,
the Mando crosses had like this gray blue
[SPEAKER_01]: tint to them, which I found like really
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see a bunch of those in the
Finos, but I did see a couple that were
[SPEAKER_01]: like this blue gray color with like heavy
frost and like a gassy nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, that's what got it in to the
to the lineup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like the other Finos were tight,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it was tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as like the background lineage,
there's so many different Yoda pets.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a Yoda G there's over the
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it can get like a bit of a myriad
like that at times, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like I think it might even be one of
the most recent posts on your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the biddies, it looks phenomenal,
like these super swollen hand grenade type
[SPEAKER_00]: buds, just gorgeous, rich purple hues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find that the purple lines like
this so well, or do you feel like that
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat prevalent myth around purple
strains not being super potent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of cancels out any increase in terms
of like sales or interest?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think they they go well.
[SPEAKER_01]: People people like that color pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that biddies that is comes in a bunch
of different colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I had that's a great strain
because you get so much selection in that
[SPEAKER_01]: you got Mike's selected cut of the
jigglers, which is already fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get this selection of Bahama
reversed onto it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're getting, you know,
crazy phenos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, the one with like that hand
grain hand grenade size mug, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's that big.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fills the palm of your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So super heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had a great, you know, more gelato side
nose on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like the leaf ratio, there's like no
leaves on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's there's like no trimming to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I mean, that's I kept I
definitely kept that keeper cat to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with down the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of the other phenos that were in
there had different almost like gassy kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of weird smells to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was even like a grape one like
it was ugly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was one of the testers ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just didn't have the right leaves to it
to be a keeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the smell was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smelled like grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, like there was quite a few cool
jigglers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them look awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved I think it's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miami Mommy, too, is one of my heavy
favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really loved everything in the lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, look, strong sales pitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to admit the biddies was one
that I was looking at myself thinking this
[SPEAKER_00]: might be the one I'd pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me wonder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the name biddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always think how important is a
strain name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's sort of only really
matters if the strain isn't good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if the strain is good enough,
it doesn't really matter what the strain
[SPEAKER_00]: name is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think it really actually makes a
difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it does to an extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I named that biddies because if
you know my boy, Mike, you kind of with
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the most outlandish, sometimes
borderline offensive names ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured like, OK, if I'm going to you
know, it's a it's an exotic soul fire
[SPEAKER_01]: collab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to have a name that that that
would be proper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went with biddies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think the names do matter a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: People want some creativity in the names.
[SPEAKER_01]: People want you to take some time and
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not easy with like absolutely
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to make sure that nobody has the
shit or it causes a desktop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, names are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess there's a little follow up to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you tend to name strains before you've
grown them out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you like to grow them out and sort
of use that experience as some inspiration
[SPEAKER_00]: for the name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got to grow them out first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just the reason why I ask is
because I find it interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sort of see it more commonly these
days where people put a post up being
[SPEAKER_00]: like, hey, the name biddies is now taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like they've just dusted the
female with pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sort of like, don't you want to
grow it out first?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess biddies is a bad example of
people like, you know, orange lemonade
[SPEAKER_00]: cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, don't you want to make sure
that's actually like the flavor in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what if what if you don't find it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how do you how do you name
something before you've seen what it is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it could be completely different
from what you may think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, you got to grow it out because
and honestly, it's going to help you name
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're going to see something in
there that maybe triggers like a name that
[SPEAKER_01]: like has a distinguishing characteristic
for that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, grow your plants out before you
name them, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I get you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, a lot of a lot of people just
don't grow their shit out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the final strains I wanted to
grow you about was the baby cakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that the description,
you know, you sort of talking about how it
[SPEAKER_00]: is a very consistent cookie type phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something which I was also curious
about was how did you get that cake mix
[SPEAKER_00]: clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I swear, that's got to be one of the
most lockdown cookie fam clones there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did that happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, they're not that locked down
because they just be sliding around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a really good circle of
friends that get these get these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it might not be as locked down
as you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like, I think people always talk
about envy genetics in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, how did he get?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess, you know, it just sort of
speaks to the crew you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's right there in the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's down in L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got, you know, he's got a good
network of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's able to he's able to find find
things that other people might not be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as just someone who has a very,
you know, soft spot for sativa,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering, do you have a plan to do
any work with some like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: strongly sativa type work or is you just
more into the indica sort of hybrids?
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely am open to it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to I was just talking about this
the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to grow a sativa plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like people always ask,
like, is this sativa dominant or is this
[SPEAKER_01]: indica dominant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's almost to the point where like
that nomenclature is kind of dead,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, where we call things sativa or
indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is so hybridized now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost hard to like find a true
sativa, I guess, unless you're ordering
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds from like the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, which of your strains do
you think is sort of one that's most sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of slept on by the public, like sort of
like that secret dark horse that you think
[SPEAKER_00]: is a real winner, but maybe just needs a
bit more time before it catches on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think our mind flare is, you know,
it came out in the white jelly lineup and
[SPEAKER_01]: it was just I thought it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just all these different flavor
profiles were in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we just use it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used our keeper in with the Bahama
Mama, and that's what made the Miami Mami.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just crushed in there like so many
keepers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was throwing them away like I just can't
keep them all, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think when people dig into the Miami
Mami and see what that's all about and
[SPEAKER_01]: when you get these kind of like chocolatey
really rich pheno, like smelling phenos
[SPEAKER_01]: and like this frost that is putting off
and the colorways that they have,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, you know, it's going to
really open their eyes to the mind flare
[SPEAKER_01]: and the selections that we've done over
time with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe we can change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, sort of in a similar light,
what do you think is the most consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: line in terms of plants produced,
like what the plants produce?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I ask this is because
we've got a lot of listeners who grow
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors and for them, they ideally want
to be able to, you know, like harvest a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of plants and it just all goes in
the same bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like consistency for some people is
quite important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which line do you think gives pretty
consistent results?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're talking about like phenotypic
consistency across all the crosses.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're going to see a lot of that
in this Bahama line because the Bahama was
[SPEAKER_01]: so dominant in like and like passing on
that color frost and structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see a lot of phenotypic
similarities in this lineup.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I would say not in the black banana
lineup, because everything was vastly
[SPEAKER_01]: different in that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably could see some of that in the
in the white jelly, because the white
[SPEAKER_01]: jelly kind of did that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like where it brought those similarities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, definitely the Bahama line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a strong presence of Bahama in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what genetics in general excite you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like what are you sort of
excited to hunt next?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were to sort of pop some other
seeds from someone else, how many seeds do
[SPEAKER_00]: you like to pop to get an idea of what's
going on with that line?
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, I'll just grab like interesting
packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I can't find something tight in just
one pack, pack of your seeds, I'm probably
[SPEAKER_01]: not with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, I'm going to pop this
Bloomco pop some of his stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, of course, Mike's creations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always popping shit out of his stuff,
mostly because I can just hit him up and
[SPEAKER_01]: get him.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are looking tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up with the strawberry gears,
bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I need I need my fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any of any of the exotic stuff is
tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, Bloomco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Relentless always has great work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can really see that he puts
in a lot of time in his stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might pop a pack of Masonics stuff
because I had such great results with what
[SPEAKER_01]: I got from him last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who else?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to pop some dead pan head,
I think his name is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to pop some of his stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have some of his peach stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might be popping some of the wave
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I got their what their peach
rings, I think it's called.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to find this peach turp that
people are talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to hunt a bunch of peach
flavored stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what I can find.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for peaches and grapes kind
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see what I can find.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy popping other people's work and
seeing what what cool shit it's fun for
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely can get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go down with that sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Lumpy Space Princess, that's that's
a cool strain, both because it's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: reference to Adventure Time, as well as,
you know, it looks phenomenal when you
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the plants it's both been bred
with and it on itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find that like you name strains
with references like also there's the Grim
[SPEAKER_00]: Bastard OG, which is a phenomenal
reference to Trailer Park Boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you name these because these strains
remind you of that reference in some way
[SPEAKER_00]: or it's just special to you and like what
sort of makes you think, oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give this like a cool name
that's a reference to a show or to a game
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that thing looked like Lumpy Space
Princess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like what we were talking about,
you got to grow them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I grew them out, I was like,
I'm slumping on these lumps right here
[SPEAKER_01]: because that thing looks like Lumpy Space
Princess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I I like the LSP.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, that might be something
that we revisit at some point because
[SPEAKER_01]: people just absolutely love that cross,
like the pink hues that it comes with and
[SPEAKER_01]: that musky lemon flavor that you can
actually taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like that strain like those things
have been sold out for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I like to I like to reference
pop culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I play a ton of I'm a gamer myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I play a ton of video games.
[SPEAKER_01]: I play video games with my kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We even run a Grand Theft Auto server like
where people come in and play like Grand
[SPEAKER_01]: Theft Auto online.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, we just we're we're pop
culture fanatics, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your own GTA server.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, we love it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like a RP server.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get in there and you know,
you role play whatever you're playing and
[SPEAKER_01]: people like really get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it's it's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: A whole new world for both me and the
listeners to go and explore a bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think we're going to I was
thinking about doing like a seed drop in
[SPEAKER_01]: the in the in the GTA server.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you would just get in and do
something maybe to get a specific pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds that you can only get by hopping in
and hopping into 5M and coming into the
[SPEAKER_01]: the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: So might be something in the future to
look out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's the next level drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I noticed amongst the various strains
you've made, you've worked with a few
[SPEAKER_00]: different cookie cuts or sort of cookie
related strains like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: from just straight cookies to the Northern
Fire cookies to even things like biscotti,
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the cookie cuts are your
preferred ones if you had to pick,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, one or two?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you like to breed with cookies,
generally speaking?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, because I like the structure of
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the smell of cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the creation of cookies
really was a turning point in in breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: and in cannabis culture, you know,
and however you feel about the cookies
[SPEAKER_01]: machine and brand and burner and all that,
put that shit to the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you really just can't take away from
these guys what they, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what that what that plant has done,
at least breeding wise, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I like the the the North Fire
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to have a cut of cookies and cream
that I thought was the best one to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: far better than the 13, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do enjoy breeding with cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's I think it adds some
characteristics to the progeny that can
[SPEAKER_01]: only be found in those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't try to over add too much of it
to the lineup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I like to have a little
something for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm missing missing that mark by
not having enough sativa and maybe we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: fix that in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's a good one to add.
[SPEAKER_01]: North Fire cookies right now is the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the final question before we do our
quick fire questions at the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that you'd had some nice write
ups in high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like in the past, high times
played a huge role in our scene and in
[SPEAKER_00]: promotion and awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as Instagram and other social media
platforms have taken off, it feels like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's faded a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you feel like you got a bump out of
those write ups and those features,
[SPEAKER_00]: or do you feel like they are sort of
fading a bit into obscurity?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I mean, maybe we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't pay too much attention to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like high times is kind of it used
to be like this like flagship for our
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be like high times,
you know, and maybe it's because the covid
[SPEAKER_01]: and the shows are gone or the shows have
been so fucked up with like the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can't even enter any of these
damn shows anymore without being licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: in that state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just turned a bunch of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just disappointed in high times in
that aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it used to be the one thing that we
all used to come together to do to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: these competitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've really just turned it into
like an advertisement for whatever local
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational breeders are going to line
their pockets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they've really I don't know if it's
the new owners or what's going on over
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the general sentiment from
like most of the heads in the industry is
[SPEAKER_01]: just like they're pretty irrelevant at
this point and they need to come back to
[SPEAKER_01]: like what started them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we got a bump from it, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I miss the old high times,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say that, do you sort of mean
like before it was like pay to play?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like I should clarify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it's not all pay to play
because I can bet my left leg you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: pay for their article.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like that's one of the criticisms
which gets leveled against them at times,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: People used to like I know when Mike and
Cuban were winning all of their just on
[SPEAKER_01]: that run, like winning all their their
trophies and whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys weren't paying to win that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I'm right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the circle didn't pay that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just had fire and they were winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so like I hear so many times
like, oh, like if you want a cup,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's because you paid or that's because
you did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's absolutely not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys won that shit fair and square.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, yeah, I think it's like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, they're just I think maybe I
don't know their financials, but maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: high times is upside down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to make some money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can make all that money.
[SPEAKER_01]: That money by showing by making having
some awesome shows once maybe Covid gets
[SPEAKER_01]: off of our ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's some really valid points.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I definitely have heard that
criticism raised before about the
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing of the cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think like what you said is really
valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people like Exotic Mike and
various others clearly not paying to win
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly got the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of the frustration is more
like when you see strain write ups in the
[SPEAKER_00]: magazine and it's like we're doing a write
up this week on Crop King's blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, oh, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so I mean, bringing us to sort
of our quick fire questions that we love
[SPEAKER_00]: to ask all guests at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one I wanted to ask you is what
is the best or most memorable single weed
[SPEAKER_00]: experience you've had?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be like smoking a certain
flower, smoking a certain hash or just
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: What stands out the most to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know why, but one of the
just when Mike and I smoked lemon tree at
[SPEAKER_01]: the Emerald Cup or something, we just were
like, just love the flavor so damn much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to get a get a cut for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really it's a really interesting
flavor, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's one of a kind, actually,
like the it's the aftertaste, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that it stays on your palate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like what we're looking for
when it comes to flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the weed could be pretty,
the weed could be this or that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it leaves that aftertaste in your
mouth like that lemon tree does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's memorable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's definitely one of the
most memorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can I can understand why you'd say
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the other end of the spectrum,
though, was there ever a situation where
[SPEAKER_00]: people around you or people who you sort
of generally trust the opinion you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like hyping a strain up and then you
finally taste it and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, is that it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't know it off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: One that we're just like, oh, that's not
that tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not for me personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't think of one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost a good thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people around you are only suggesting
and hyping up the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do a bit of a hypothetical,
you know, I'm going to drop you off on a
[SPEAKER_00]: remote desert island with just three
strains and you can theoretically grow
[SPEAKER_00]: them for the rest of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What three are you taking with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: They can either be clones or seeds,
whatever you want, but just three,
[SPEAKER_01]: just three GMO probably take my cut of
banana runs and only get one more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some funk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you say I'm on the island?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to bring the Bahama Mama.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now there's a chance to be a little bit
devilish here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say the roles are reversed and
instead of you being dropped off,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to drop someone else off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's just say that you're not a big
fan of this person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to pick what three strains you're
going to drop them off with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to leave them with?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to leave them with a CBD strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll leave them with some CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big fan of this person,
right?
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other strains are not that great right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What junk would I leave somebody with?
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably still give them GMO,
even though I don't like them because we
[SPEAKER_01]: know it's going to take them 12 weeks to
finish it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just going to be frustrating
either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll probably leave them with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's got some CBD, he's got some GMO,
and maybe I'll leave him with some some
[SPEAKER_01]: apple fritter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you're not a fan of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not that I'm not a fan of it,
but yeah, I'll just leave it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, leave him with some fritter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like what everybody wants to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he can grow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, look, we've heard a lot of blue dreams
in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess it's sort of like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I mean, hey, dude, there's a time the
blue dream was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why people hate on that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So final question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could go back in time to any place,
anywhere in history and just collect some
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds or a clone, if you wanted,
where would you go?
[SPEAKER_00]: What time and what are you collecting?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, because if you go too far
back in time, it's going to be some boof.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would probably go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would probably go back to when I was a
little kid and my my uncle was was growing
[SPEAKER_01]: and I probably snatched some of his clones
from from the garage that I.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I would walk into and I was a little
tiny kid blind myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd probably grab some of whatever
he was growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a he's an old hippie from from
Humboldt, from Arcata.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd probably grab some of his strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's probably some cool gems
lurking in the vault from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that just about brings us to the
end of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there any comments or shout outs you
wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just shout out to all the homies,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, shout out to James for,
you know, seats here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great, great spot to grab,
grab beans from.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's I was really proud when we got put
onto seats here now back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was a really big, big move.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's one of the first banks that ever
really took a shot with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So appreciate him for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to James Bean on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, likewise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, shout out, James Bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate you being a sponsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you referenced earlier one of our
other sponsors, Promix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you use their medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out, Promix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I didn't know they were one of your
sponsors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out, Promix.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be awesome if you could get it to
Seattle more because we, we have Promix
[SPEAKER_01]: like desert sometime where you just can't
get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to like stock up on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they Canadian?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're Canadian, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think they're sort of more the other
side of Washington, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Quebec side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them know, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I stress out because if I don't
have the Promix, then I got to get
[SPEAKER_01]: something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hate using anything other than
Promix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with that being said, we've been
very grateful to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, thank you so much, Sol of
Soulfire Genetics for coming on,
[SPEAKER_00]: giving us the low down on all your strains
and a bit of history and predictions for
[SPEAKER_00]: the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you have it, gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge shout out to Sol.
