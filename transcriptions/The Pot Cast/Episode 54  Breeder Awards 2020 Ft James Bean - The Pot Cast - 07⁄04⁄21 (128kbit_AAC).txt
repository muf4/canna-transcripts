the hottest breeder, hottest clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: hottest strain, MVP of the year?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if they match up to ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alrighty, gang.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are back for the 2020 Breeder Awards
for the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm joined as always by the man in the
thick of the scene, the bean master
[SPEAKER_01]: himself, Mr. James Bean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a bumpy 2020, but you know,
I didn't get sued by any processors or
[SPEAKER_04]: have any banks trying to rip my shit off
or, you know, the website stayed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm good.
I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is unheard of.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you manage to do it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had a credit card processor all
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, maybe that's how they
didn't, they weren't able to steal my
[SPEAKER_04]: money, because I didn't give it to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the guys, you know, finally got the
case dropped for the processor,
[SPEAKER_04]: tried to sue me for 200,000, got that
dropped this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't do an emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that helped with finances.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't do trade shows.
[SPEAKER_04]: That helped.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really brilliant point you bring
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for the past 12 months,
I've been talking to many guests on the
[SPEAKER_01]: show about whether or not they think the
Emerald Cup will be something they do in
[SPEAKER_01]: future years or any of the broader events
for that fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think Emerald Cup is a pretty focal
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts on the Emerald Cup
itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: And should we expect to see seeds here now
in the future?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't think you'll see my booth
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we did our last working with them
when I had the 10 booths at the last show
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that will be our end of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the whole vibe is just going
to change, period, because of rec.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rec comes in and it smashes everything and
it says no smoking in public.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it kills all the shows.
[SPEAKER_04]: No public consumption.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it has to change.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's inevitable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, a bit of a hairy topic,
but I remember around the time of rec
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in in California, at least,
there was lots of discussion from the pro
[SPEAKER_01]: rec people about how it's going to bring,
like it's going to increase the consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: base.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get more casual
enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be more money in
circulation for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from what I've seen over the past
three or four years now, it seems as
[SPEAKER_01]: though it's almost caused the real diehard
market to fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: off a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, there is a lot of people
casually consuming cannabis, but it feels
[SPEAKER_01]: like our sort of crew of people who are
like, you know, the real down the rabbit
[SPEAKER_01]: hole fanaticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of feels like it's died off a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it has.
[SPEAKER_04]: As the shows in the West where it passed
first back in 2010, 2011, as the shows in
[SPEAKER_04]: the West, the rec has caught up with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've become less cannabis friendly,
like sure to sell it and do this and that
[SPEAKER_04]: or talk about it, but you can't sell any
of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all the big players, your crowd,
our crowd would be tied up in a rec market
[SPEAKER_04]: now or have a recreational facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore, they don't want to mess up
their facility or their license because
[SPEAKER_04]: they want to go out and sell some beans at
a show.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it has fallen off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, like, you know,
the laws have caught up with the shows.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not any high times cups in Seattle
or Portland or California anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be very rough for anybody to
participate in those shows.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a producer or somebody who makes
genetics, because they potentially can
[SPEAKER_04]: lose all their licensing and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's an interesting position it's
put us in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you might be in a bit of a good
position to answer this one, but have you
[SPEAKER_01]: spoken to any of your breeders or any
associates you have who are kind of happy
[SPEAKER_01]: with the way it's all panned out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do most people sort of wish it maybe
panned out a little differently?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think that everybody is not happy
with their laws independently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there are just as a general
consensus, they all are not thrilled with
[SPEAKER_04]: the way things are going.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know when Exotic First got his wreck in
Washington, shit was rough for him.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that guy is a multi-billionaire
and have all this stuff, all this money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the beginning of his wreck shops in
Washington was rough.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, it was a rough start and
they put a lot of restraints on him,
[SPEAKER_04]: so to say, but he's been able to get
through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, you know, like there's so many
things wrong with the Washington law,
[SPEAKER_04]: for example, no home grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's California law, for example,
it was six per person per household.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's six per address.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're just, you know,
no taxes on medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're taxing medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you tax on medicine?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but so I think that,
you know, they sold him a bill of shit for
[SPEAKER_04]: the California one and everybody's shit
about that one and pissed off.
[SPEAKER_04]: But because, you know, just what they
didn't want to happen was big corporate
[SPEAKER_04]: catalyst to come in and they came in and
got cozy.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you raise an interesting point there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the past year, we've seen a number of
different, like well-respected
[SPEAKER_01]: journalistic platforms discuss how some of
the big producers have gone bust,
[SPEAKER_01]: most notably in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think their wreck scene has lost
incredible amounts of money across the
[SPEAKER_01]: board with just crop failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And companies collapsing and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might think that that would lead to an
increase in homegrown, but we just heard
[SPEAKER_01]: what you said about they're clamping down
on those laws, whether it's backed by
[SPEAKER_01]: stats or just sort of hunches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like over the past year,
more people have started homegrown or do
[SPEAKER_01]: you think more and more people are relying
on the rec market?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the people I know think the rec market
is a joke.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I always make a joke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we'll smoke this rec weed here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get so much higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not the way it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, our sales are up from last
year because of my excellent customer
[SPEAKER_04]: service or my shining personality.
[SPEAKER_04]: But sales are definitely up than they were
last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely people are growing home at
more, growing at home more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody wants to pay the rec prices and
nobody knows where that shit came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can grow their own and grow it for
cheaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All you need, especially with autos coming
into play now, all you need is a tent and
[SPEAKER_04]: light and you're going to go under 500
bucks and get set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Autos are really taken off, especially
with the advent of new breeders and
[SPEAKER_01]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any auto breeders who you're
keeping your eye on?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to let out my secrets,
but I will tell you about my additions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I recently brought on Gas Reaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been doing it out of Michigan and
Ohio for the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a strain called Deez Runs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got four strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: He got a big drop.
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as we got it, he sold it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sold out over the first weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking to get restocked on that
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: He gives credit to Mephisto.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got another gem and I work with in
wholesale that does bigger amounts,
[SPEAKER_04]: bulk, like 10,000, 20,000 kilos,
two kilos of beans at a time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing autos and knocking it out of the
park too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those will all be coming our way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to buy a kilo, but I'll talk
to that breeder about buying less
[SPEAKER_04]: quantities and put them in the best gross
packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll probably check for those after
the first.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that for the longest time I was
getting messages from people being like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mephisto's out of stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whose autos do I buy?
[SPEAKER_01]: For a minute there, it was kind of hard to
give them a good answer, but I think
[SPEAKER_01]: you've just given us a nice one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my same problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the time, Mephisto was the best in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I called him once and said, hey,
you guys just need to scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: How can I help?
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as we get them, they would fly
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I didn't have Mephisto in stock,
people ask me, who else?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I don't really want to tell you
somebody else because I'm not really
[SPEAKER_04]: comfortable or that confident as I was in
Mephisto.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather give you Mephisto if I had it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I really have a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now those industries change in the
last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys have worked with Mephisto
before, used a couple of their mails in a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mephisto is still great, but other people
are going to come up as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, speaking about that, I think this
might be a nice little segue into our
[SPEAKER_01]: first award, which is hottest newcomer on
the scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we get into that, I want to say
this will segment nicely, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to thank you and your audience
for having me on and doing these shows
[SPEAKER_04]: with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You make me feel like a superstar.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you do these interviews with a little
bean thrower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate your audience and your faith
in me and everything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to make a retraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may have said in a couple of shows here
or there, most likely, that I wasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: thrilled on Jungle Boys gear.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, these guys are growers,
they're not breeders.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I should buy them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to retract that statement and
say that even though I don't sell them
[SPEAKER_04]: yet, their gear is good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had multiple people run it and tell
me if there's multiple keepers per pack.
[SPEAKER_04]: I retract any negative statements I want
to say about them because I don't want to
[SPEAKER_04]: mislead anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I don't sell it, I do think
it's quality gear to get.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, thank you likewise for always
supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love having you on and gaining the
insights and obviously really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really appreciate how you get behind the
show and help us to make episodes happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: More importantly, it's a sign of integrity
that you're willing to go back and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, re-evaluate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think these guys are actually doing a
good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we'll talk about them a little more
down the track.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe well-timed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump into the first award,
which is hottest newcomer on the scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that last year, this award was
actually won by none other than AK
[SPEAKER_01]: Beanbrains, our friend on the final
frontier.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's had a pretty busy year again this
year, but we're making way for the new
[SPEAKER_01]: blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to ask, what's your prediction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who in your mind is the hottest newcomer
on the scene?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think that there's definitely some
new guys that I've gotten.
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned Envy, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mentioned Big Maze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bloom could possibly be in that category.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, it's got to be Soulfire.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been working with him for about two,
three years now, but the guy is really
[SPEAKER_04]: passionate.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's really legit.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a drop set for this winter,
I remember, because I was in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was going to drop it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the media all done.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was ready to go with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then he called me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's ready yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I've had some tests.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not so sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I'm going to release it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to just scrap it and rework the
line.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, you build your reputation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes you five years to build your
reputation, and it takes you five minutes
[SPEAKER_04]: to kill it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a smart idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure enough, he decided to scrap the whole
line, just because it wasn't up to his
[SPEAKER_04]: standard.
[SPEAKER_04]: He scrapped it and started again.
[SPEAKER_04]: He released that Dawn Mega line later on
in the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gangbusters flew out really, really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: He did some nice stuff for the community
as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Soulfire.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a really good guy, hanging out with
Exotic, sharing cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got great stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I will 100% agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The winner of this year's hottest newcomer
to the scene is indeed Soulfire Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has had an insanely big year.
[SPEAKER_01]: He caught my eye very early on in the year
when I was browsing the seeds here on our
[SPEAKER_01]: website, and I saw all of the YU Jelly
Femmes hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing that caught my eye about
that was the fact that he had such lovely
[SPEAKER_01]: photos and specimens of all of the plants
growing out, which I think we've discussed
[SPEAKER_01]: in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is generally a sign of a good
breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're going to show you photos of the
growing progeny of what they're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell you, that's just great, first off the
bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The YU Jelly caught my eye, and then I did
a little digging and found that it used
[SPEAKER_01]: Gelato and the Dawn Mega male,
which makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you referenced, he had a great year
with Dawn Mega, which is the really cool
[SPEAKER_01]: GMO black banana hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty popular stuff all around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he went even further, had his Runce
release, which one of the few breeders who
[SPEAKER_01]: bred with Runce.
[SPEAKER_04]: The banana Runce.
[SPEAKER_04]: That stuff flew out of the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give us some perspective on the banana
Runce.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did that go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did that just melt down the servers for
you guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty much it was gone on the first
day, I do believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: It went super fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: You only had a limited amount of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess Runce doesn't put off a ton of
offspring, so to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: They came and they went for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fastly, very fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had gotten his drop out after Exotica.
[SPEAKER_04]: His first Runce dropped out before
Exotica's second Runce drop, which is even
[SPEAKER_04]: before, I think, the Runce crew got theirs
out because they did a collab with... Ah,
[SPEAKER_04]: was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: They did a collab with... So, I think
Runce had some seeds they sold that were
[SPEAKER_01]: just Runce seeds, and then they've also
currently got a collab in the works with
[SPEAKER_01]: Compound Genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it was, Compound.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did a collab with Compound.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, funny story.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the Runce guys called one of my
breeders and were like, hey, are you going
[SPEAKER_04]: to pay me for that?
[SPEAKER_04]: He just hung up on him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He thought he was supposed to scare him or
something, but he didn't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just hung up on him.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting tactic for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why Exotica went really hot with
him, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: He got the jump on him, so to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before, there was Runce and seed farming.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had his out and crossed out with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how they would put out seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a male Runce?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know, all the Runce releases
have been famed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a bit of whispers going around
about maybe this was just a failed crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they seeded the whole place,
and that's where these seeds came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there wasn't a lot of discussion
about the production of these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just kind of appeared one day,
and they were... What are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: $700 a pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there were a few people who had
some opinions about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even know they were selling them,
but no, that's something I tell breeders
[SPEAKER_04]: in the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because you fucked up your room
doesn't mean you're a seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't give you rights to put them
in packaging and sell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just scrap the crop and try to blast it,
but don't try to be a seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know the story behind the Runce,
but that's always my question.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they did it on purpose, there's a male.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's a love child, happy lucky,
there's not a male.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you had a male Runce,
you'd be breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd have that hitting everything,
and you'd have that in the position to be
[SPEAKER_04]: able to lock that thing down and get it
towards... It could be only yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: It should keep that male and you'd covet
him.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if there's an S1 running around or
Runce running around, you can't protect
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't keep the lid on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as one of them is gone,
they're all gone, and everybody has it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another one of those things where
until we see the male, it's hard to know
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to jump back to the man of the hour,
Sulfire, you know, done incredible work
[SPEAKER_01]: with the Runce, with the Don Mega,
and he's even done some cool collab
[SPEAKER_01]: projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that a good buddy of mine,
the North Fire, has done a collab with him
[SPEAKER_01]: using his Northern Fire cookies cut across
to the Don Mega male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have the very altruistic cross
done by Sulfire being the Free the Duke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd love to get a little bit more
details from you about the backstory on
[SPEAKER_01]: that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he had called me out.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is after Duke had put this stuff out
about Duke.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, hey, I got this unreleased
strain that I want to put out and I want
[SPEAKER_04]: all the money to go to Duke.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, hey, no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he sent me 100 packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We listed them for 100 bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I cut Duke's wife a check for 10 grand
at the beginning of December.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's lovely that he's willing to
donate one of his unreleased strains for
[SPEAKER_01]: charitable causes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that just helps to back why we
selected him as this year's winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a sort of runner up, I'm going to
give it to Envy Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've made a real storm on the scene
this year, come out with some real fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been lucky enough to have some
friends of mine grow their workout.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice smoke for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously credit to the grower as
well, as always, but good genetics and
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the hottest sort of cookie cut
crews, some of the hottest cookie cuts in
[SPEAKER_01]: the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're coming from the cookie fam crew,
among many others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has Envy Genetics caught your eye at all
this year?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, we started carrying Envy at the
middle of this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he would probably be one of my
seed bank sites, you know, best newcomer
[SPEAKER_04]: of the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've had Soulfire for a couple of
years now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Envy is a really good guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has a lot of people testing his gear.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've had a lot of pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've said before, pictures that sells a
thousand packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got great media.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's really good on social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: He talks to all his customers and that's
what they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want interaction with the guy that
says, hey, if this happens, how do I fix
[SPEAKER_04]: it?
[SPEAKER_04]: So good guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just released what I think is going to
be next year's straight of the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of called runs last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to flood the market again.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to me, what I've seen a lot of right
now is Gary Tatin for next year's straight
[SPEAKER_04]: of the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, and Envy just had a drop with a
strength he called the glove, which is a
[SPEAKER_04]: Gary Tatin cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I joke about that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, you must have somebody in
JBJ's warehouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep getting these cuts, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got just amazing cuts and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, he's definitely putting out
some lead, hard to get cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another Gary Tatin was going for $6,000 a
cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That puts that 5k cut of OG to shame.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was 5k and five pounds for OG from
Ghost to Organ Kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: 5k and five pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm selling it short, aren't I?
[SPEAKER_04]: OG's still the king.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, Soulfire, congrats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Envy, congrats on the nice runner up
prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to give a few quick little
honorable shout outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put a poll up on Instagram about two
weeks ago, just kind of gauging the
[SPEAKER_01]: community's thoughts on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a sentiment that was commonly echoed
that I wholeheartedly jump behind is ABF,
[SPEAKER_01]: always be flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got a lot of notable mentions,
particularly he did some work with Runce
[SPEAKER_01]: this year doing some interesting crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: One called the Patriot Kush really caught
my attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: TK crossed to Runce.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just looking at the names on the
pack, you could expect something pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: fire coming out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Likewise, we had a surprising number of
people who voted for AK Beanbrains again,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he won it last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think he can be the newcomer
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get that your first year,
at least your first big year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, your first big year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, shout out to AK Beanbrains,
still doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another person who got a lot of
mentions who I wanted to give a shout out
[SPEAKER_01]: to was JTrees and SkunkTech for their work
with the Black Cube and Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully those crosses will be released
in the near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're unavailable at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think any seed banks, they're
still testing them, but a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: are keeping their eyes on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to JTrees and SkunkTech as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any honorable mentions you want to throw
out there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know if it's too early yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: He might be still a sleeper, but Bloom has
been good for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really believe in that guy's work.
[SPEAKER_04]: He used to be with Oni Noodle,
so it's Terry Palms is Bloom now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's putting out some really good gear
that we've got in the whole oven.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he's doing good things,
but it might be still too early for him.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're sleeping on him, go pick up
his packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if not, maybe next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I actually did see quite a few
people suggest Bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was admittedly a little behind the
eight ball on that one and was scratching
[SPEAKER_01]: my head thinking, who is this Bloom seed
co?
[SPEAKER_01]: But after doing a bit of researching,
that all makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Harry Palms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So onto the next award for this year,
which I think we're going to piggyback
[SPEAKER_01]: based on what you said earlier,
where you were predicting Gary Payton to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a clone of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about this year's hottest clone
of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a few sites such as Leafly
and Strainly, like some of the more
[SPEAKER_01]: mainstream cannabis websites that have
already come out and declared it the year
[SPEAKER_01]: of the runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hate to be a wet blanket,
but we kind of declared it last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were ahead of the curve, my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was kind of our call last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: But social media is always going to be the
big media players who aren't in the game
[SPEAKER_04]: are always going to be a year behind.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's us kind of guys who are on the
bleeding edge, if you will, trying to be
[SPEAKER_04]: keeping up with everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I mean, Runs absolutely crushed
it this year, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went from strength to strength,
although we could see last year it was
[SPEAKER_01]: already on a momentous upswing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's continued to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if nothing else, it shows the
value of good marketing in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think even if there are breeders you
don't personally like, if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing well, you've got something you
can learn from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as the Runs crew have shown,
they're not necessarily breeders in their
[SPEAKER_01]: own right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by God, have they kind of taken it out
this year?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like every pair of breeders,
whenever I have a two-piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people have really defied that
this statement is going to be the Swamp
[SPEAKER_04]: Boys.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've kept it together.
[SPEAKER_04]: But every other two-piece breeder pack
I've had, pair, has split up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they haven't done well.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's usually a hype guy and a guy with
the passion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a guy making all the noise and
yelling.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every other two-piece I've had has
split up, but they haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: The importance of marketing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's always that hype guy that can
work on the marketing and get out there
[SPEAKER_04]: and be on the bullhorn and be pushing and
pushing and pushing it while the guy with
[SPEAKER_04]: the passion is in the garage doing the
work and doing the breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: So marketing is huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like what I called next year's
survey.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cookie fan.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't even do that shit in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've got huge marketing behind
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They push.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bernard gives a lot of credit to his first
marketing guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was no longer with him.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that credit is due.
[SPEAKER_04]: How they can even still operate after
candy rain, I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they have great marketing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Gary Payton is also going to be a big
thing, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that will get some more
traction as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to jump back to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately, although Runs has
crushed it this year, kind of won last
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to give it to something else
this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there has been another strain that has
topped up in my feed almost every time I
[SPEAKER_01]: go on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been worked with by some really
cool people out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most notably, the Josh D crew has done
really well with the strain I'm about to
[SPEAKER_01]: mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking that might be enough to give
it away already.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd love to hear your thoughts first.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think is worthy of the title
of hottest strain or hottest clone of the
[SPEAKER_01]: year for this year, not including Runs?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just as sales wise, I would think it would
have to be like a July gelato.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just another one of those sweet kind of
things that I've seen a good push on as
[SPEAKER_04]: far as what I call hype train.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm intrigued by you, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm intrigued.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you got?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think you're pretty well on the
money with your gelato prediction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gelato is still one of the biggest
components in any breeders sort of recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people might have thought I was
alluding to like a Josh DOG sort of thing
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioning that he's done well with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But last year at the Emerald Cup,
in fact, Josh D and his crew won the
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor award for ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And boy, have I seen ice cream cake
absolutely crush it in the rec market this
[SPEAKER_01]: past year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that among the casual enthusiasts,
I have seen more people hyped about this
[SPEAKER_01]: strain, trying to buy it than almost
anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you had any interaction with the ice
cream cake at all?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you blew me away there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that Josh D and his guys did
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was going to be a wedding
cake thing from Veezy because I hadn't
[SPEAKER_04]: worked with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, no, I've seen that one a ton of
times.
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I'm just some just a casual rec
buyer, I want you buying weed and seeing
[SPEAKER_04]: something that says ice cream cake,
I'm going to grab it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see if it tastes like ice cream
cake in the first place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it does, great.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it doesn't, I still bought it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Josh D is a good guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know he was a guy responsible for
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, definitely seen that one around.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it kind of goes back to cuts that are
held too tightly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't see a lot of people,
other people breeding with it or working
[SPEAKER_04]: with it like the ranch or like the gelato.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it might be just because they're not
letting go of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't see as many crosses as you
think with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know it's been a great strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I mean, when you're right,
you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I didn't mislead anyone there in
that you're correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ice cream cake wasn't made by Josh D.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was made by exactly who you predicted,
JBZ.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it's a cross of wedding cake and
gelato 33, which is interesting because
[SPEAKER_01]: normally you see people breeding with the
41 a little more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cool stuff has come from the 33.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most recently, I've seen a lot of cool
stuff come out of the 41.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, which I think is probably my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you're correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: JBZ killed it with this breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just mostly Josh D.
[SPEAKER_01]: who's done well promoting it from what
I've seen and helping get some momentum
[SPEAKER_01]: behind that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of like the like archives
one star, the lemon peel.
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't he didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't say he did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chiarojo did.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just he just found the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, there's lots of beans can
have a single breeding and it takes people
[SPEAKER_04]: to pop them to find good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something which has made me think
about is that ice cream cake, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the blending of gelato and wedding cake,
it's a great strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not trying to detract from that,
but it is working within similar sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got me wondering when the next
strain that comes along will take the cake
[SPEAKER_01]: for being, excuse the pun, for being
something just utterly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, you know, last year we
said that the strain of the year was Mack
[SPEAKER_01]: because, you know, the clone was just
absolutely mopping up everybody who could
[SPEAKER_01]: get their hands on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that kind of fits the bill to
an extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does beg the question of when we're
going to see something just utterly left
[SPEAKER_01]: of field to the sort of cookie genetics
which have dominated so heavily over the
[SPEAKER_01]: past few years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that would definitely be it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm, of course, pulling for a land
race, something rare, something old,
[SPEAKER_04]: something new to the current people that
buy, but something that the old heads have
[SPEAKER_04]: known and loved for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it gets played from both sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my little, little tidbit to that,
which I can totally get behind in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting to see some land race stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone's keen on some crazy Southeast
Asian sort of weed, the Forever Amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: Bodhi has this Vietnamese 33 or Vietnamese
32.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll look into whichever one it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But gosh, I hope something comes of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was lucky enough to try some of that
from him, I think two years ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And still some of the most memorable weed
I've ever had for those old heads looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for that old Southeast Asian hitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So explain it to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bodhi didn't share any of that with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So explain it to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what do you, what enticed you about
it?
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you like?
[SPEAKER_04]: What kept you going back to that strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was like, it was the first strain
I'd had in a very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just made me that very stereotypical,
like super giggly, really happy,
[SPEAKER_01]: really uplifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the sort of weed you wish you
could bring to a party where like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not going to make anyone sit on the
couch.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to be more up,
more dance and having fun joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like everything they described
Super Silver Haze to be, but just like
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when I first got high,
when I was, I didn't start getting high
[SPEAKER_04]: until I was like 18, 19.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was probably 19 or 20 with my
roommate.
[SPEAKER_04]: He looked at me and he was like,
I wish I could get that high, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I could get that high still.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it might be some of that kind of,
you know, that early stuff, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for reals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just as like a little side note,
this year I took a fair few different sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of tolerance breaks at various points for
various reasons, some sort of work
[SPEAKER_01]: related, some sort of just, you know,
personal, you know, challenges I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you what, I took a two week
break from smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I came back, it was like getting high
for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anyone is like your old roommate
who's really missing it, I know it can be
[SPEAKER_01]: tough, but I'll tell you what,
you go two weeks or so without smoking and
[SPEAKER_01]: you come back, you are going to have to
strap yourself in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I told him to go back to joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't my fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I don't know if I could last the
whole two weeks or things, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially being in my house by myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I could, but I have to
try.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might give that a try for the first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, understandably, people have
been smoking a little more, but as long as
[SPEAKER_01]: they've been smoking good, that's what
we're hoping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: No seeds, no stamps.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next award we're going to move on
to is most anticipated seed drop for the
[SPEAKER_01]: coming year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, last year we had a few people in the
mix for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Matt Wright's Blue Bonnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Karma's Sour in the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also had the A5 Hayes Femmes he was
looking to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was quite a diverse sort of range
of strains that were up in the air that
[SPEAKER_01]: people were really excited about seeing
drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything this year for the coming
year that's really caught your eye that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're thinking is going to make a big
splash over the coming 12 months?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not in the upcoming year.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just happened crazy enough,
if you said you asked.
[SPEAKER_04]: It happened Thursday on my website,
but Humboldt Seed Company came out with
[SPEAKER_04]: the Super Freak.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a Freak Show cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Humboldt has been crushing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember I picked that up like two years
ago, and he's a good guy, good gear,
[SPEAKER_04]: great marketing, great packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, Freak Show last year,
I guess it was the beginning of this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that thing, it's an ABF.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's an Alaskan strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it grows, of course, like a looks
like a fern.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that really like hyper serrated
leaf, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very thin, it looked like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very fern-like.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, when that came out, all the seeds
were white and not just a couple,
[SPEAKER_04]: but like across the board, because you can
see them in his packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were all white.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had to make a post on Instagram
that said, you know, don't send them back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually white means immature, but these
are not immature.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just give them, they're supposed to be
white.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always, I love it how, you know,
some strains produce really unique seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember a while back, we were
speaking to Gooey Breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he mentioned that, you know,
some of his African strains produce seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: that are pitch black, like no tiger
stripes, just straight black.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess it goes to show when you
consider the Super Freak you just
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned the diversity of phenotypes
within seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Freak, Crash with Freak Show.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's actually Super Freak.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's definitely, I think we're
going to see a lot more of that as more
[SPEAKER_04]: different strains come to light,
so to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, I still think we're
definitely going to find a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: additional stuff in some of that Asian
stuff, some of that Thai stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: some of those terpenes, I think,
that haven't really had the luxury of
[SPEAKER_04]: going into a sequencing machine or
something that says what church is going
[SPEAKER_04]: to produce.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great suggestion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't heard too much about that from
the fans, but I had been following it on
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's cool to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting some traction and people can
now go and grab it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone, you know where to head to to
pick that one up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of what I had been keeping my
eye on, I had two things which really
[SPEAKER_01]: caught my eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also, you know, threw the
question out to the fans on Instagram to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of get a bit of a gauge on what they
were thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had three things come up pretty
consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of them I was especially hyped for,
but one of them the fans were especially
[SPEAKER_01]: hyped for.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, the one I'm most waiting in
anticipation to see, and I know that some
[SPEAKER_01]: people are probably going to think that
I've invoked some bad juju on myself for
[SPEAKER_01]: saying this, but the Rezdog Sauer IBL,
we've seen him posting packs of the newest
[SPEAKER_01]: release that he's just created.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe they're for sale yet,
except for through maybe one friend he
[SPEAKER_01]: has.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you happen to bump into that guy in
person, I haven't been following enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: really be able to follow that.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, he seems to have made the newest
release of this Sauer DIBL.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like he's just got a cut of the
Sauer, had some of the old Sauer IBL
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, found a male, crossed it,
taken it to the next generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard much about that at all?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, so I'm sure you've talked to your
audience, but we know Sauer D is a bag
[SPEAKER_04]: seed from Chem D, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it's definitely bag seed
from Chem, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the more I try to dig into it,
the more I'm less sure about what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, actually, so Mojave had the
guy on, Sauer Silicate on a different
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast, and he came out, the guy who did
it, and said, yeah, it was just a Chem Dog
[SPEAKER_04]: bag seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was kind of, to have it clarified,
from Mojave.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Mojave is basically Adam Dunn's
brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a guy who kind of created Sage,
works with the Big Sur Holy Weed,
[SPEAKER_04]: extremely vetting, very, very old school,
as far as strange goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for him to come out and put his
mark, so to say, on Sauer Silicate was
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of, you know, because he had met him
back in the day, they'd come to Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_04]: with it at first, and blown Amsterdam away
with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it was kind of out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could start to worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that's brilliant to hear that
it's been vouched for by Mojave.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually heard Bodhi speak quite highly
of him as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's cool to hear two corroborating
stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the aspect I'm most interested in
is, do you think this newest edition of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Sauer IBL from Rez will do well,
or do you think the negative stigma that a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people feel hangs over his head
will continue, and that would draw people
[SPEAKER_01]: away from buying it?
[SPEAKER_01]: My hunch is that although a lot of people
are quite suspicious of Rez Dogg's
[SPEAKER_01]: history, many of these same people will
tell you that some of his work was the
[SPEAKER_01]: best they've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think when push comes to shove,
people will buy the packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I stay away from things that cause
me drama, maybe, and that quite just may
[SPEAKER_04]: cause me some drama.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, he has his history.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know somebody that's still in contact
with him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had spoke about possibly dropping
through my bank, and we had talked to him
[SPEAKER_04]: about some, or talked through this friend
in between us about coming by.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people are claiming Sauer's.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for him to have a Sauer IBL coming
back off, you know, whatever, whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: happened this or that will, you know,
it's me as a bitch, social media is a
[SPEAKER_04]: bitch.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they will, I think that, you know,
he will have people that will still say
[SPEAKER_04]: things of him, or they'll always be out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has to completely change his name for
him to do anything positive, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just too much other than I wasn't
there for.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just do know the amount of things
that are said on one side or the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, you know, it can be equally
said, but it's just a lot of talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's that much talk about a
negative thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's never good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's understandable that people might
be quite hesitant to get involved,
[SPEAKER_01]: given that some of the allegations revolve
around, like, police and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to give definitive rulings,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as that, though, I mean,
if a strain is fire, it's fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you're going to come to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to draw you in.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be unstoppable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's something you're going to open
the jar for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if it's that kind of strain,
you know, people may rename or do this or
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, then I think it will sell
and then be good.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think, you know, the cannabis plants
talk, you know, there are some people that
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't agree with, the breeders that I
don't agree with.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have the same set of opinions on
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But is your gear bad?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked them up for a reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not wrong that often.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they still make great stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just not thrilled with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and that could be the stuff
about res.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with a strange fire, you're going to
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that Karma kind of put out a
statement of sort of similar tone when he
[SPEAKER_01]: said, you know, look, my Sauer BX2,
it's based off a Sauer I found in a pack
[SPEAKER_01]: of res dogs work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You now know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to mention him anymore
because I don't want to mention him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that kind of speaks to that
idea of like separating the individual
[SPEAKER_01]: from the art, as some people would have
said.
[SPEAKER_01]: But onto the next choices, we had two
contenders that I think were kind of very
[SPEAKER_01]: closely following the Sauer IBL.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a lot of people, including myself,
who had been tracking AK Beanbrains,
[SPEAKER_01]: who has done a reproduction of supposedly
it's hard to vouch for certain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Supposedly, authentic stock of Beatrix
Choice from the Super Sativa Seed Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard about this or seen anything
about it?
[SPEAKER_04]: The SSSC is legendary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their packs are, I believe they're like
quarter sabers, which we put in a quarter
[SPEAKER_04]: pack.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has like 10 little seeds in the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So SSSC on the outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where Vickai got his stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beatrix Choice, I haven't heard of,
I mean, I know the strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what they're doing with it,
but it should be awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people were put onto it
after our second episode ever with
[SPEAKER_01]: SkunkVA.
[SPEAKER_01]: He spoke very fondly about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that helped sort of reignite
some of the flames in the community about
[SPEAKER_01]: getting it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, AK Beanbrains has been
generous enough to do this reproduction in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of he got his hands on a pack of
some more what he's kind of known for the
[SPEAKER_01]: fabled freezer stock that's been in
someone's freezer for a good 25,
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's hit some of the seed banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think people are pretty excited
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does, however, bring us to the final
sort of honorable mention for the
[SPEAKER_01]: anticipated strain of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one has definitely got some
controversy around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, people are so keen
for it being that it is the Swabi S1
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, also more commonly just Pakistani
land race seeds that come originally from
[SPEAKER_01]: Irizan of the Indian land race team.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent interview, by the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent interview.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like listening to it, learning a lot
about that guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a pleasure to listen to, isn't he?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he was just, you know, his passion.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could just tell it that, you know,
he had to grow this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would swat him and he had to go up
here and get it from these people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, just the things that he did
to get where he was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, they want especially I
can't imagine like how they would be in
[SPEAKER_04]: those type of countries that, you know,
are definitely marijuana is not the
[SPEAKER_04]: greatest thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, he's got a lot of hearts for the
right reasons, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like a really good interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's a guy who I've never heard of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never heard anyone talk a bad word
about him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a very passionate guy and we're very
grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to jump back to it, so, you know,
he collected these land race Pakistani
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked them for a generation or two and
then he sent some to some friends and most
[SPEAKER_01]: notably he sent some to Mass Medical
Strains who then did a reproduction of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only available in the feminized form where
he crossed, made some S1s as well as some
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of sister pairings where,
you know, crossing one Swabi to its
[SPEAKER_01]: sister.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that although there has been a
little bit of controversy around this
[SPEAKER_01]: strain, it's kind of come to fruition in
the end in the sense that the seeds are
[SPEAKER_01]: being released to the public and all of
the proceeds are going towards helping to
[SPEAKER_01]: fund a library project in sort of the area
of the world where Irizan is based.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it very much sort of an idea of that
there's being some sort of charity or
[SPEAKER_01]: compassion side to the release of the
seeds and not being a sort of for-profit
[SPEAKER_01]: release to the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, shout out to Irizan and to Mass
Medical for getting those seeds out to the
[SPEAKER_01]: public.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have dropped recently, but no one's
been able to finish flowering them out
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think people are very excited for
what this land race is like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, which does it take?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, gosh, I mean, you ask some breeders
and it's like, just takes a week after you
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest the seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that some people would probably
have maybe just flipped them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they got released like four weeks
ago or something around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that there were a lot of people
who were a bit bummed out when they found
[SPEAKER_01]: out they weren't going to be released,
which was the sort of the story for a
[SPEAKER_01]: short period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then him and Irizan were able to sort
out a situation whereby the proceeds of
[SPEAKER_01]: that seed drop would go towards building
the library.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good outcome in terms of what
the alternative outcome would have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people are excited about that
thin-leafed Paki.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he caught me a little bit by
surprise.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to go look into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know he was releasing gear.
[SPEAKER_04]: But once again, it goes back to us saying
earlier about it's different.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the same cookie bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the same genetics that are played
over and milkshaked.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just like the freak show, just like
the sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, who knows?
[SPEAKER_04]: The sour could be next year's big thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that the new people are
like, it's new to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the old heads are like, this is really
sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it is, you know, you can hit both
of them and watch them be stranded next
[SPEAKER_04]: year.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though it's done by Rez.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it's different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people are sick of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That F1 Durban, they've had enough of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want a fresh taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bringing us to the second last award.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clone Hall of Fame.
[SPEAKER_01]: So last year, Girl Scout Cookie took the
award for all of the mixed opinions and
[SPEAKER_01]: theories on cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has understandably stood the test of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the given reason for why it
made it into the Hall of Fame.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, we're kind of taking a step
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably surprising to a lot of people
that cookies made it in before this one,
[SPEAKER_01]: given the grand following we have on this
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am happy to say that this year's
Hall of Fame clone is none other than the
[SPEAKER_01]: ChemDog 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure Kim will be happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's also just a killer strain
that has had multiple generational impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was lucky enough, Kim, two years
ago, ChemDog took me to see the... I've
[SPEAKER_04]: never seen a Grateful Dead before.
[SPEAKER_04]: ChemDog took me to see them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I came to visit them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Took me to see them at like 20 years to
the day where he had seen them for his
[SPEAKER_04]: first time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were meeting up with Mickey Hart,
the drummer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we met up ahead of time because
ChemDog did a release, a collab with
[SPEAKER_04]: Mickey, something called Grateful.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had like 10 pinner joints in a can.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like pinners, like not very big at
all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mickey said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe on that show I will make them a
little bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh my God, you can't go
smaller.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but that was a Kim 91 cross with him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, you know, there's, I told Mickey,
I said, you know, there's, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the ChemD and the CIS and what are those?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to get into that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, it was really a pleasure to meet
him and his stories and the Kim and how
[SPEAKER_04]: he'd been all over with it and how it
started kind of with their thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, it's been, it's an awesome
thing, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Greg, yeah, I remember Greg did that
shit and it was like 17, 18 years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't, nobody was collecting seeds or
growing shit back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were just hustling them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, undeniably, you know, the ChemDog
is the backbone of so many companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's hard to count them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the legacy that was started by Mass G
ChemDog carried on by the New York crew
[SPEAKER_01]: before the torch was passed on to the man
himself, Skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_01]: For many years, she's been the queen of
modern cannabis that's redefined the
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning of potency and given birth to
countless strains, countless clone onlys
[SPEAKER_01]: and just in general, given the public
something to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's undeniable that she's
stood the test of time and still to this
[SPEAKER_01]: day puts many a grown man green in the
face and many modern elites to shame in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of its potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, she's what people refer to when
they talk about the old school funk,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the older heads reminiscing
about how they're dissatisfied with the
[SPEAKER_01]: current strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she's the one that they're
thinking of when they're talking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: old school fire they remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more importantly, she still gives
birth to some of the most fire hybrids you
[SPEAKER_01]: see today have grown correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that if you look at a bunch of
Skunk VA's work, he's done a bunch of Chem
[SPEAKER_01]: 91 hybrids that sure to sort of hit the
spot and honor her properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, you know, that's a good
way to pay homage to this strain is to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow out work from breeders who are
working with it correctly, trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce good offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because unfortunately, there are a lot of
hybrids out there that are labeled as
[SPEAKER_01]: having Chem 91 in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we've discussed many times in the
past, there's only a small number of
[SPEAKER_01]: people in this world who actually have the
real cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far too often you see misspelt versions
of ChemDog with a W in the name in
[SPEAKER_01]: people's genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure they think that that's
ChemDog, but unfortunately it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think that it's great that
she's still around, that she's giving
[SPEAKER_01]: people the pleasure of being able to smoke
her and it's sort of our due diligence to
[SPEAKER_01]: support the proper breeders who are
working with it correctly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just a hard hitter,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just super, super potent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, the old school heads,
they need to get a little more kick
[SPEAKER_04]: because they're a little older,
so they need a little more potency.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, they know what you're
talking about and definitely it's
[SPEAKER_04]: well-deserved every quality breeder that
they have in the national, like you were
[SPEAKER_04]: saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they have it, they can throw it and
it's a great strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So given the timing of our chat today,
I wanted to introduce a new category that
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't in last year's awards, and it might
be something we continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think I said before that we were
doing the second last award when we did
[SPEAKER_01]: the Hall of Fame strain, but this will
actually be the second last one before we
[SPEAKER_01]: get onto Breeder of the Year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the new category we're introducing
this year will be the Breeder Hall of
[SPEAKER_01]: Fame.
[SPEAKER_01]: And although High Times does their own
version of this and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: countless other organizations do,
this year I feel is a special year because
[SPEAKER_01]: just this morning, in fact, at the time of
recording, we unfortunately heard the
[SPEAKER_01]: passing of a very revered and senior
veteran of the scene, Bog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bog was not only pivotal on the forums,
but he was also, you know, really
[SPEAKER_01]: well-known for many of his strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you've got the Bog Bubble,
the Sour Bubble, the Sour Dub,
[SPEAKER_01]: Boggle Gum, Blue Moon Rocks, Sour Grapes,
Lifesaver, LSD, Sour Store Breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, it goes on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many acclaimed breeders have used
his work within their own lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: People like Swarmy Organic, TGA,
303 Seeds, Trichome Jungles, Alien
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics, Canarado, Sin City, Karma,
Seed Junkie, and of course, possibly the
[SPEAKER_01]: most notable account of his work in it
creating a large percentage of the
[SPEAKER_01]: parental genetics within Josie Wales and
Lonnie Watts, GG4, with the Sour Dub being
[SPEAKER_01]: one half of the suspected genetic
combination in that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of that, countless clones and
breedings have occurred that utilize,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, distant lineages of his work,
and I'm sure even more to come that will
[SPEAKER_01]: honor his legacy within our scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's, you know, rightly so that
we wish Pat all the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send her our good wishes and thoughts and
hope that she can do the best she can in
[SPEAKER_01]: this understandably tough time for her and
the family.
[SPEAKER_04]: It also makes me think as you're speaking
there, I know that, you know, Duke tried
[SPEAKER_04]: to call me earlier this evening and I'll
pick up the next time he calls,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I know that Duke had sent him a
screaming eagle pollen because he wanted,
[SPEAKER_04]: Duke wanted to help get Bog back on the
map, so to say, to bring him back out into
[SPEAKER_04]: the light and get him some sales.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I know that he had sent Jim and
asked him if he would use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I, I middled the deal, I mediated it,
but Jim said, yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: He would love to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Duke had sent him some, some pollen and
this would have been before Duke went into
[SPEAKER_04]: jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe two years ago, maybe they
probably reconnected at the email cup we
[SPEAKER_04]: were at.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but I wonder, I have to talk to Jim
Jr. See what came of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be pretty awesome if they did that
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I know it, so Jim Jr. has been
breeding with Jim, Bog Jr. as he told me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they all, they still have this year's
crop of gear.
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, you know, they made a couple,
smaller things, but as, as, as I know it,
[SPEAKER_04]: as of today, you know, things always
change, but he said they were going to
[SPEAKER_04]: keep making gear and keep using the stock
that he had.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, I'm sure Pat's had a huge
helping hand and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If he's been working with Jim Jr.,
then that's the father of the son.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it could be some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms. Jill hit me up on Instagram and she
said she wanted a couple of packs of Life
[SPEAKER_04]: Saver because her and Subcool had made a
cross way back when they first got
[SPEAKER_04]: together, they're involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: Life Saver.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, I said, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then she, she told me, she said,
you know, I just wanted to let you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, unfortunately, Bog passed away
yesterday morning and I was just floored.
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked up the phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I called Mrs. Bog, Pat, his wife.
[SPEAKER_04]: I read a new Bog.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Jim and his wife, Pat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I called her right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, she picked up the phone and
couldn't, she called me back.
[SPEAKER_04]: My first one with the voicemail,
she called me back.
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as I said who I was, she started
crying.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, and I, of course I, I, you know,
she was crying.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I just hung up the phone and let it
go and let her, let it, let her grieve.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it was just, you know, 20,
less than 24 hours, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I had a great relationship with
those two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, everybody has respect to the hell out
of Bog.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Bog stood for bushy old grower
and a lot of people wouldn't be where they
[SPEAKER_04]: are today.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it wasn't for his help on the forums
back in the day, like getting in the chat
[SPEAKER_04]: rooms and helping people grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's when you see a lot of people,
you know, talk trash and IG and Facebook
[SPEAKER_04]: because you're so mean and you're so such
bullshit to where the forums back in the
[SPEAKER_04]: day, they weren't mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you grew something, somebody would
be like, Oh, look at the PM.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't tell you that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were like, Hey, you know,
if you do this and this, you can fix that
[SPEAKER_04]: situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it was a lot, a lot kinder back
then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and he, he helped many, many a grower,
uh, earn, you know, learn how they're
[SPEAKER_04]: doing their basics all the way through,
you know, their, their great stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, he's, he has so many chains that,
you know, uh, sour boggle, sour bubble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, his, and some of his, if you ever got
bogs bubble hash, amazing, amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I was, I was lucky enough to work
with them for the last five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, uh, it's, it's, I've seen shout outs
from true Kanna, um, true cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, Barry are there, uh, true to shout
out, um, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just, it was just a pillar and a
legend.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't know it in the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, they weren't, um,
they weren't rich folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm glad he got to see them.
[SPEAKER_04]: He got to see the passing of rec,
but I'm sad he got to see the start of
[SPEAKER_04]: corporate bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm sure he would have hoped it was
going in a different direction,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I first met bog in 2016 and,
uh, at a, at a hemp con and at the cow
[SPEAKER_04]: palace and San Fran and his wife had a
booth and I went up to him and talked to
[SPEAKER_04]: him and pitched him and big fan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we started working with them from
then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah, uh, so if I, if I put this
here or not, but, um, I talked to,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, Jim's son, Patrick's Jim's son,
Jim Jr. Earlier this evening, right before
[SPEAKER_04]: we aired this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I asked, um, if we could do raise
money for funeral expenses, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: we could cover that on a, on a go fund me
and, uh, and Jim Jr. Said, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: he was, he was thrilled.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was touched.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like, he didn't know what to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like, I can't, you know,
the community outreach has been so
[SPEAKER_04]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, your dad did a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he helped a lot of people get
where they were.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, you did a great interview with
him, uh, earlier on that I found
[SPEAKER_04]: thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoying the last half hour got into some
true bog stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about the aliens and Shasta.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just an amazing guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And pretty much it, you know, um,
I know a lot of people have used his work
[SPEAKER_04]: in a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the base.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the, it's the building blocks for a
lot of different strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: And more importantly, knowledge to these
breeders that are where they're at today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to do a go fund me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be on my IG or, uh, uh, that the
real seats here now, or at the real James
[SPEAKER_04]: be, um, we're going to raise some,
some funds for the funeral expenses and
[SPEAKER_04]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm going to try and work
something out and get Mrs. Boggs some
[SPEAKER_04]: money.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's what Jim would have
wanted is for the community to raise some
[SPEAKER_04]: money for her, take care of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he would never ask.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course he would never say that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know she wouldn't either.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, we'll do it and we'll do a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, hopefully it turns out good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reasons I don't know, um,
I didn't ask.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just, it wasn't anything coming up
to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't, it wasn't, um, sick or
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it just, it just happened all of a
sudden.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that means not to believe it was
this crazy year of COVID that was,
[SPEAKER_04]: was not COVID because it would have been
sick for awhile.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would have heard about it,
but this was just a surprising thing that
[SPEAKER_04]: happened yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: They, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, my best wishes to my
condolences to the family.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, uh, I think the community is
going to come out and surprise you though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we'll do some good things with the
go fund me and definitely hall of fame.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some lovely words there and everyone,
please be sure to go jump in on the go
fund me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And help support Pat as, uh, she rightly
deserves.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think something else too is,
you know, I know Jill's going to make a
[SPEAKER_04]: strain that she had done with sub cool,
but I think if breeders all came out with
[SPEAKER_04]: a strain or something, maybe I could work
something out with some of the guys and
[SPEAKER_04]: say, Hey, do a strain and maybe give a
kickback.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, I think of all the breeders did
something in like big homage or,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, used his, he used his gear and a
cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be pretty, pretty amazing,
pretty remarkable this day and age,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that brings us to, um, the final award
for the year, which is the big,
[SPEAKER_01]: big, big, big first place trophy that we
have, the breeder of the year award.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need like sound effects here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, beep, beep, beep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the drum air horn so bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm going to smoke a fire,
you know, but no, uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got for the breeder of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a lot of people in contention
for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some honorable mentions for this year,
uh, our award winner of last year,
[SPEAKER_01]: CSI Humbolt got a number of honorable
mentions from the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also had some very, very, very strong
support for the man Mean Gene with all the
[SPEAKER_01]: memes up his sleeve who did very well this
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And amazing breeder and amazing guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he's hosted a lot of the auctions,
um, for Nick or for, for Duke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, he probably, if you don't know Mean
Gene, he was, uh, of the breeding team
[SPEAKER_04]: aficionado, um, back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now he is, uh, free born selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Mean Gene's got some really nice
stuff in the works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, his cherry west back cross,
as well as he's done a collab with Bio
[SPEAKER_01]: Vortex being the cherry lime dog,
all look really awesome in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also had some strong support for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Archive as usual, not surprising Fletcher
putting out some really nice work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people in the community trying
to give him some big ups.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also got a nice shout out for Trichrome
Jungle Seeds for his most recent Lilt
[SPEAKER_01]: line, which has done well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were some people last year who
were getting excited for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was in contention for one of the
anticipated drop awards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good to see that that's panned out
and people are kind of giving him a thumbs
[SPEAKER_01]: up for possible breeder of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me, I think that, there was only
ever really two people in my mind who I
[SPEAKER_01]: think we're going to get this award.
[SPEAKER_01]: And admittedly it has been obviously a bit
of a different year to the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that plays into who's going to
be able to win this because it becomes a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more about marketing seeing as
everyone's stuck at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're all filtered through the lens of
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, I think that the winner could
be none other than someone who's already
[SPEAKER_01]: been mentioned a plethora of times is one
of the hottest breeders in the scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: None other than Trichrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of the mystique to it,
I think, is that this guy hasn't been
[SPEAKER_01]: actively selling seeds and yet he's one
breeder of the year because he's still
[SPEAKER_01]: doing work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more kind of behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think an interesting little side
note is if you go to the Cookies website
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, more than half of their menu
are JBZ collaborations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Berry Pie, Georgia Pie,
Honey Buns, Ocean Ave, Sticky,
[SPEAKER_01]: sorry, Ocean Beach, Sticky Buns,
Sweet Tea, and one that I think is a cool
[SPEAKER_01]: little pun for you, Collins Ave.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: JBZ is actually, you know, he told me when
he first got and had the meeting with
[SPEAKER_04]: Berner and the Cookie Fam, I was like,
oh, shit, this is not going to go good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he said he said actually the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, you know, when Berner picked him
up, they picked him up in a nice,
[SPEAKER_04]: fat ride, nice ride and took him to a nice
place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he thought Berner was going to come at
him crazy, but he came at him super
[SPEAKER_04]: respectful and they worked out an
excellent deal and he was completely happy
[SPEAKER_04]: with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's definitely crushing it right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: His last nursery he put up is crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the post he put about his nursery,
he must have had hundreds of people ask
[SPEAKER_04]: him, where can I buy your clones?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where can I buy your clones at?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you in rec?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you in rec?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he is in rec.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has his own facility now so he can sell
clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that nursery, I sent a message.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, you're going to have a line
outside the door of your nursery,
[SPEAKER_04]: bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, BZ is definitely the shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, Cookie Fam didn't make cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they need somebody to make the
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, man, he's going to, I'm going to
be in a rap song and he's going to shoot
[SPEAKER_04]: me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I saw Berner breeding the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a paintbrush out and he was
pollinating things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe to prove that he was breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good photo op, good photo op.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, look, it speaks to JB's
dedication and effort because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, he's done well with the cookie
crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: His cross ice cream cake got clone of the
year from us, as earlier mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more importantly, anyone who's had
their eyes on the gelato cross sherb BX1
[SPEAKER_01]: AKA jealousy would have seen that almost
every plant coming out of those packs is
[SPEAKER_01]: fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more, more kind of what I follow is
how the remaining few packs that are out
[SPEAKER_01]: in circulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a few, admittedly,
I see people posting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just getting more expensive by the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you what, you want to talk about
a pack that's going to go for a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got one of those, that's a nice
little piggy bank you're sitting on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I happen to have five.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have five of all the music packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize it was called jealousy,
but he's done that a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_04]: So name things just to piss people off or
do something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and Beez is not, not new in the game
either.
[SPEAKER_04]: I first thought I thought it was type guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause he was so, um, he had those strains,
but, um, once I talked to him,
[SPEAKER_04]: he's been doing shit since like 98 and he
was buying packs from guys in town.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were taxing his ass on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he flew her to Amsterdam, got his own
gear, started breeding within the early,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, 2000s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then those guys, all of a sudden he
was selling packs too and taxing them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he was, he's, he's a gangster.
[SPEAKER_04]: He loves the gassy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when he gets, uh, that's, you know,
they really likes, um, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: he's great dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're doing it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, he's a thing I said last year on the
show, but he's one of those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if he was going to stab me,
it'd be him, you know, that's cool to
[SPEAKER_01]: hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what, you know, as you just
referenced, anyone who's been following
[SPEAKER_01]: his work knows that this isn't like an
overnight success for him by any means
[SPEAKER_01]: he's been put in the hard yards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing I remember him for is that I
think he's probably the first person I
[SPEAKER_01]: ever saw doing like a BX2, BX3 on the TK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he wanted like a TK male,
like he recognized how good the TK was in
[SPEAKER_01]: my opinion, before anyone else,
except for maybe Swamp Boys, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like he was, he was on the ball
a while ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, cause TK is all the rage at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think for good reason, it's one of
the best strains out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like he, he recognized that
before a lot of people did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, and yeah, definitely on the,
on the BX through twos and threes and
[SPEAKER_04]: Beasley's that kind of guy is going to
work some until he finds it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now where he's got a rec facility,
he's even more dangerous because it's like
[SPEAKER_04]: exotic in the, in the archive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once now they have a rec facility,
they can pop, you know, they can do
[SPEAKER_04]: phenolones with thousand, 2000.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they look for the one they want and
just take the other ones and send them out
[SPEAKER_04]: to the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that helps a lot, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big congrats to Jay Beasley.
[SPEAKER_01]: of Seed Junkie Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone's looking to try some of the
flower as you can no longer get seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately, unless you've got a pretty
penny, go check out Cookie Genetics as
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing a range of collabs with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, speaking on the topic of TK,
I wanted to give an honorable mention
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was admittedly a close second
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the person in my opinion, who got
runner up Breeder of the Year goes to none
[SPEAKER_01]: other than the already mentioned Jungle
Boys with the advent of their first seed
[SPEAKER_01]: drops occurring earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the year, we saw a lot of their packets
just selling out almost instantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sold them primarily from their
stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I found most interesting was as
far as I know, I could be wrong,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they are the first people I know who
sold seeds through their store and had
[SPEAKER_01]: other seed banks lining up at the store to
buy those seeds to then on sell them with
[SPEAKER_01]: a markup, which, you know, admittedly,
I think that's kind of cool because it
[SPEAKER_01]: reflects the popularity and it helps
people who don't live in California get
[SPEAKER_01]: access to these seeds, which otherwise you
had to be there in person to buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it goes to show the hype that was
surrounding that drop that they had other
[SPEAKER_01]: seed banks in line waiting to buy 10,
20 packs to then sell them on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard much about the Jungle Boys
drop you referenced earlier?
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be a little something in the
works.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish they don't call me back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I know why.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know about the little selling
them out of their stores and having other
[SPEAKER_04]: banks pick them up and resell them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a whole lot of ridiculousness,
but it does speak to their popularity and
[SPEAKER_04]: their skill because as I mentioned
earlier, a friend of mine did a phenom
[SPEAKER_04]: hunt with a bunch of packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said there was multiple keepers in the
Jungle Boys stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they definitely have potential to
do some serious damage to the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they seriously make their mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for Breeder of the Year, I definitely
think that you're right on point with
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure Jungle Boys used to grow out some
of Beezy's gear.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Beezy's got a longer history in it
and probably a greater genetic catalog in
[SPEAKER_04]: the library to choose from.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Jungle Boys don't call me back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I know why.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't need a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have guys that are going to wait in
line and resell shit for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, look, I mean, they've got to be one
of the masters of the marketing,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Ivan has done a very good job at
marketing Jungle Boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think anyone who denies that is just a
little bit jealous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, Ivan, he crushed it with
obviously it's Orange Cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the first, that's how he got on
my map was they were crushing it with that
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, obviously, of course,
it was a little, they're not giving me
[SPEAKER_04]: enough credit, you know, but he always
does that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, they are marketing geniuses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why they don't return my
emails.
Damn it!
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry, I'm just as upset as you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to get my hands on a pack and I
don't know how it'll otherwise happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, to give credit where credit's
due, they've done some really nice work
[SPEAKER_01]: with the TKBX1 mail they've made.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've also released some nice crosses
with the Jungle Cake mail they've used.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a few other crosses they use
using like an MBK Sunset Sherbet sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've also got a Skittles Cake mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using among others, which have
done really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the thing which impresses me the
most about their work, though,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that they've done what I had always
advocated is the best way to be a breeder,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is they just spent years doing these
phenohunts, finding these killer cuts that
[SPEAKER_01]: people were dying for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once they amassed enough of them,
they were like, cool, I've now got my
[SPEAKER_01]: palette to do my painting and to do my
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so pretty much all of their crosses,
for the most part, use unique cuts and or
[SPEAKER_01]: strains that they've spent the time
phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of documented demand and
quality surrounding those strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, as much as there might be some
people who don't like the brand itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there's very little,
if anything, you can criticize about the
[SPEAKER_01]: way they've gone about releasing these
seeds in the, you know, they didn't just
[SPEAKER_01]: go buy a bunch of clones and hit it with
the first mail they found.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did spend some quality time
phenohunting many of the females used in
[SPEAKER_01]: the crosses as well as generating the
mail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, and that's years of times that
they, that they do have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they crush it with their social media
game.
[SPEAKER_04]: They crush it with photos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we spoke about photos earlier and
they have awesome photos because,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, in point, cause their,
their shit's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't have great photos of my gear
wasn't awesome, but you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they, everything was good,
super frosty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah, like I said, I heard good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to get them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will try.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I know how hyped they are,
but, uh, I don't know if they'll sell to
[SPEAKER_04]: me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably telling me to pick a number
and get in line.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that being said, I think we're
just about at the end of the awards for
[SPEAKER_01]: this year's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were there any comments, shout outs or hot
tips you wanted to give the listeners?
[SPEAKER_04]: Personally, I haven't dealt with BZ since
2019 and I haven't dealt with jungle boys
[SPEAKER_04]: and I haven't gotten there in their line
yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, what I do know though is from my bank
personally, I'd like to throw out there
[SPEAKER_04]: just as a, as a honorable mention,
but exotic genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I probably talked about them last
year, but he had six big drops with us
[SPEAKER_04]: this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, of my 60 breeders, he was,
he outsold everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the closest guy wasn't even half the
packs that Mike sold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the six drops, he came out swinging
with the grease monkey fem line at green
[SPEAKER_04]: of the year, which was huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then he had a two, uh,
the, the runs drop came, which you got,
[SPEAKER_04]: like I was saying there, you know,
he got the jump on the runs guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he was able to release a whole
string with it with those guys or a whole,
[SPEAKER_04]: a whole line of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, then he had the red pop, which is his
strawberries and creme Fino.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was another, another complete drop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he came back and redid the runs,
the runs drop again, which all,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, all these sold out within less
than a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I, I even hit him up for packs after
the fact.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, Hey, okay, I'm more than the
big ones were sold out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then of course he closed it off
with, uh, with the rainbow chip line.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, you know, he's got, he's it's kind
of a winning combination.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're starting to see he takes
great photos.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a rec license.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can run, he can run females.
[SPEAKER_04]: He can run the numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and that gives him, you know,
it's not, it's not cheating, but it gives
[SPEAKER_04]: him a greater ability to find the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the more numbers you run,
the more things you can find.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, he's been, I've been lucky
to deal with him for, for eight years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he's been doing it for maybe 15
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, you know, shout out to exotic Mike
and he, uh, as, as my seed bank goes,
