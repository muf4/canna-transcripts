[SPEAKER_02]: Hello and welcome to another episode of
The Podcast, a cannabis podcast for
[SPEAKER_02]: budding enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: This episode, as always, was brought to

[SPEAKER_02]: number one seed bank in the game,
Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know them, you trust them,
you love them, guarantee unsatisfaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why grow out something which you then
might be pissed off about and there's just
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guarantees there for a reason,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: On this episode, we're joined by the one
and only Shahbud of 707 Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really excited to bring this one to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a whole bunch of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's jump into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty, I'd like to extend a big thank
you and welcome to Shahbud of 707 Seed
[SPEAKER_02]: Bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first question we've been doing
recently, what are you currently smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I still love my OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: The SFV cut has been my favorite for 15
plus years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been smoking a little bit of that,
a little bit of lemon tree, doing some
[SPEAKER_01]: blends of the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give that lemon tree a little extra kick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot to go into.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, the SFV thing,
that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've noticed a lot of the chem fam seems
to favor SFV.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that a lot of people just
like don't really maybe have the real cut
[SPEAKER_02]: and so they don't think it's the best?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, why do you think that most,
I guess what I'm trying to say is why do
[SPEAKER_02]: you think most people don't regard it as
the best while a lot of the real heads do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the majority of the people that
have SFV now have some kind of fake cut
[SPEAKER_01]: they bought from the club and was just
called SFV.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the dispensaries out here,
I know they pass off a Cali Connection cut
[SPEAKER_01]: of the San Fernando Valley as the real
cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a lot of mislabeling and they
probably just don't have the real deal is
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And out of curiosity, do you think all of
the CaliCon hybrid are made with the real
[SPEAKER_02]: one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Swerve?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows about that guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure he's just throwing names on stuff
here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got me for a few packs of seeds,
maybe 10 plus years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worst seeds I've ever grown in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even worse than Sensi Seed now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, he got me for a few packs too,
but here's what I do have to say about
[SPEAKER_02]: Swerve because I know Swerve, he listens
to the show and he doesn't like me because
[SPEAKER_02]: I've said some things about him in the
past.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I think is true, and I don't say
this as a criticism, is I like to describe
[SPEAKER_02]: Swerve's gear as like a glass cannon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you run like six Femseeds from
him, you're probably going to find four
[SPEAKER_02]: Hermes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of them could well be a really
nice keeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was my experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran like three of his packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think out of the three packs,
I found two keepers, which is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like I hope to find at least one
from one pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I was hoping for three,
got two, so maybe a little low.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, those keepers were nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact that the others were Hermes,
that was a bit like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd maybe just prefer they weren't
keepers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But oh, well, I guess that's... Were they
Feminise seeds or regular seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Feminise.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's how we can add more to the
story.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the packs, one of the ones that I
was particularly blown away by was the,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was Bubba Kush Feminise.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was from like a BX line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I heard that he actually
purchased that line from someone else and
[SPEAKER_02]: hadn't really done it himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, oh, well, I like that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got me for, I'd bought 10 packs of his
SFV OG, you know, and went back and forth
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he sold himself pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, out of that 10 pack of seeds or
the 10 packs, I ended up throwing most of
[SPEAKER_01]: it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I knew that he definitely had some
issues with the SFV line in particular a
[SPEAKER_02]: few years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think ultimately the reason he came
out and said that there was some pollen
[SPEAKER_02]: contamination issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think he also, I mean, I could be
totally wrong, but I think he also said
[SPEAKER_02]: that like it was a, he had outsourced that
crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, I think that's maybe how it
happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: If so, feel free to come on the show,
Swerve.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked him, he said, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he sold me pretty good on those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I kept on asking him, I was like,
you know, they need to be consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what did, I think he said,
like there were worked to F6 or F7 or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seed finder says that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were consistent, but it was,
it was consistent crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it ended up being.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that, that means that like I got no,
no idea of what SFV is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's my only real experience with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the Cali connection SFV?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew out all the OGs side by side one
year, everything I could get my hands on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the SFV, the ghost, the fire,
the triangle, the Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else was there?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a Wi-Fi number three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I had gone from, uh, from a
cornbread Ricky or I don't forget what his
[SPEAKER_01]: name goes by big Ricky from a swamp boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, there were my, my favorite out of
all of them was SFV.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even, even to this day, there's just,
uh, it works great for my body chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never lets me down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always just, uh, takes me to a higher
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't matter how much of it I smoke,
it gets me higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And higher each time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, just, just one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, it's been a good solid shoot
since, you know, the early two thousands
[SPEAKER_01]: that, uh, I've been smoking on it almost
on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still haven't gotten tired of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where do you think it sits in regards
to the OGs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's one of the originals or
where do you think it spurs off in the
[SPEAKER_02]: lineage?
[SPEAKER_02]: So to speak?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just a, uh, uh, S one maybe
off the triangle Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, probably, probably just an S one
off the triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm not too sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I stopped paying attention to a
lot of the, uh, the history and the
[SPEAKER_01]: background of strains a while ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just seems like people were making up a
lot of bullshit and yeah, the truth never
[SPEAKER_01]: really came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm going to have to push it for one
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, because this is the one I'm most
interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the suspicion, like most people that
triangle was the first, but no one can
[SPEAKER_02]: really seem to elucidate where ghost fits
into things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's like, I guess ghost could maybe
be an S one of triangle and it's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: very triangle leaning and that it's not
like lemony like SFV.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I've heard other people say that
maybe it went like the triangle to ghost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from their ghost slash um,
you know, cause obviously Oregon kid had
[SPEAKER_02]: it and he did that famous S one project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then someone was like, what if all of
the SFV and the face off and all of that
[SPEAKER_02]: just came from that S one series.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, that's, that's plausible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the face off definitely came off of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I remember when Fletch got those
originally, um, kicked down a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: cuts and, uh, yeah, I'm pretty sure he
even said there were S ones from,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the ghosts or maybe it was the cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's been so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to remember, but you know,
I, I hear people say lemony with SFV and
[SPEAKER_01]: I, when I grew them all out side by side,
I mean, it was really hard to tell a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the ghosts and the Tahoe are almost
identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, even the triangle there,
I mean, there was just slight,
[SPEAKER_01]: slight little differences when growing
them all out, but just the, the high from
[SPEAKER_01]: the SFV.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I mean, even the, the flavor just
seemed to come out better for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, every grower is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't, I don't know if I just have a
connection with that plan or what,
[SPEAKER_01]: but.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what do you think about the idea?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it was an actual grow or
if it was a philist thing, but someone
[SPEAKER_02]: basically put the idea forward that they
did a similar thing to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They collected them all and they were
like, most of them are just the same cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I seen that with the philist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just actually just saw on there a
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: ago and noticed that there were all,
but you know, with philists, who knows
[SPEAKER_01]: who's sending what cut in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and you know, did they, were they
able to trace it back to the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: to the original person, you know,
so I'm not, I'm not too until philist gets
[SPEAKER_01]: a, a, a legit cut of everything to,
to, you know, like a baseline for their
[SPEAKER_01]: galaxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's still a little up in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what do you, how far off do you
think they are?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was of the same mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was talking to someone a few
days ago and they listed a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: cuts that we had on record had been sent
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, you know, CSI has said
that he's sent in the chem 91 and purple
[SPEAKER_02]: Urkel, Mendo perps, and then not so dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so dog is sent in a few things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you go through all the Instagram
posts online, you can kind of draw up a
[SPEAKER_02]: list of what's being gathered.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I looked at the list,
I was like, that's actually pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: comprehensive and I'm pretty confident.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of these guys have got the real ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess it kind of raises the question
at what point would you feel comfortable
[SPEAKER_02]: with the galaxy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I do share that same concern,
but I now start to question like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: looking kind of complete to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you just, you just said the two
names that I, uh, I, I trust in those
[SPEAKER_01]: guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they've done their homework,
both CSI and not so dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've, uh, you know, they've tracked
down their, their cuts to the,
[SPEAKER_01]: to the original source, you know,
so those guys, I totally trust,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, totally, you know, believe in their
judgment, um, in their opinions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but the majority of the folks,
it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there's a lot of other stuff being
sent in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just not correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of blanked on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's jump back for a moment all the
way back to the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I grew my old man smokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got an older brother, older sister.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so my whole life it's always just been
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the smell, like I remember that from,
it's like one of my earliest memories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then I was a latch key kid,
both my parents were, um, so at a young
[SPEAKER_01]: age and the place I grew up in the San
Francisco area and it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, low income housing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so there was a lot of everything
around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't call it the ghetto.
[SPEAKER_01]: We called it the get-go because there was
just like every other house was cooking
[SPEAKER_01]: meth in this neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it never slept, always sirens going
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there, there was pretty much just about
anything and everything you can imagine,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, at your fingertips in this
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so my first experience with cannabis,
I was pretty young, um, probably like nine
[SPEAKER_01]: or 10 with the neighborhood kids,
uh, smoked it a couple of times,
[SPEAKER_01]: never really did anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, my eighth grade year,
someone had brought in some, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: some, some nice green nuggets to school
and we all smoked out and that was the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time I ever got really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember walking, uh, down the
hallway of the school and like just every
[SPEAKER_01]: step I took just felt like I was climbing
higher and higher, like floating in the
[SPEAKER_01]: air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, kind of, it was, you know,
I went to class that day and, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, that, that was, uh, that was a
mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have just cut and never went,
but it rocked my world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, I fell in love with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just, um, put my mind to ease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they had put me on like, you know,
uh, Ritalin, ADD medicine, all that stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: at a young age.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, the herbal has always just been,
uh, I never knew it at the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I was self-medicated with it and it
calmed me down, brought me back to normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brain wouldn't race, you know,
a thousand miles per hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then let's see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I, when I was, uh, about 10 or 11,
I ended up moving with my own uncle and
[SPEAKER_01]: then my, my, uh, had an older cousin who
wanted to go to a dead show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my uncle was like, you know,
if you want to go, you got to take me with
[SPEAKER_01]: him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was pretty young.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking it was like 13 or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the dead show with my cousin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it was, I got to experience LSD
and that changed my whole world around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was, I was pretty, uh,
random.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bunch's kid always getting into
trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I remember these doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were, uh, it was like a,
uh, a pig dressed in a cop's uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and wow, that is just, it changed my
whole world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even to this day, it's like pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, let's see from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up moving, uh, I was 14 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up moving, uh, with my sister in
New York city and live there for a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got a job, uh, it was, uh,
under the table job at this coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called the sweetheart cafe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, there was a liquor store
right next door to the, uh, coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, every day, like after work with
my tip money, I would, uh, the liquor
[SPEAKER_01]: store had this whole wall of, of high time
magazines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and they were like, you know,
from like three, four years before,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, backdated or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every day with my tip money,
I would go in there by, by, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: the high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, I would walk to a
Washington square park and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: buy a little dime sack off the Ross is in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, I had another job
where I was walking dogs for my
[SPEAKER_01]: brother-in-law's boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd go uptown, pick up the dogs,
go to central park, let the dogs loose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just roll up a blunt and read the
high times and, and just get Stoney over
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, man, as soon as I get back
to Cali, you know, every time I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what, this is my way out of the
ghetto.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was pretty much, uh, my herb,
like, you know, the beginning of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, came back to California when
I was almost 16 and, uh, just jumped right
[SPEAKER_01]: into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there was a, uh, little park when I'm
not a little park, but it's called
[SPEAKER_01]: Brioni's and, uh, I rode my bike,
you ride my BMX down there and hike down,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I didn't really know what I was
doing, but had some seeds, a hike down
[SPEAKER_01]: into the creek.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I grew them in the shade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing much really ever came out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, when, you know, the few that
I did harvest, I ended up drying them in
[SPEAKER_01]: the trees and turned brown and moldy and
nasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, this is the early,
early nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, and me being, you know,
15, 16 with some herb, it was pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was pretty stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I just wanted to ask before we
move too far past it is when you were
[SPEAKER_02]: getting that stuff from the rasters,
was it ever anything good?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would always pass it off as like
a humble county or this, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it would be would be,
it would be like a little graham baggy and
[SPEAKER_01]: the outside of it would be, you know,
brick weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the middle of it, they would
pack it full of stem and seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, it must have taken them a
good 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: To package each one of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I'll just grind it all down
and roll it up in a tobacco leaf in a
[SPEAKER_01]: blunt back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the only way I can handle the
taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, coming from Cali,
it was, uh, you know, where I grew up,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was all just pretty much like the
roadkill skunk or cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we, we barely ever saw Mexican weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and so go and travel in, uh,
America and go into like the East coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent some time in the South a little
bit and that's all they had.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all just, uh, the Brown frown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so when did you first start growing
properly?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it when you got back to Cali?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got back to Cali.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I was about 16.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived with my folks for a few months and
then I took off again and I moved in.
[SPEAKER_01]: With, uh, my pot dealer at the time,
uh, he let me, uh, couch surf and all I
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much had to do was just answer his
phone while he went to work and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, take care of his business while
he was gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He let me stay there for, it's probably a
good solid year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, I moved in with this,
uh, old HA family.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took me in for about a year and,
you know, I was doing my thing always,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, hustling on the side and
working odd jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I turned 18, I was living
with this, with this girl and my dealer at
[SPEAKER_01]: the time, his name was, his name was Rick.
[SPEAKER_01]: We called him tweaker Rick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you got early nineties in
California, everyone, uh, all the old Coke
[SPEAKER_01]: heads from the eighties turned to math in
the nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, it was kind of chaotic,
but anyhow, my pot dealer at the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: he was a tweaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we called him tweaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rick and he would do like weird shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he would come over unannounced,
you know, and be like, Hey man,
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he would take me out to his car,
turn up the music, like as loud as he
[SPEAKER_01]: could.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like whisper in my ear,
like, you know, everyone's listening to
[SPEAKER_01]: him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, uh, tweaker Rick ended up,
he was getting herb fronted as well from
[SPEAKER_01]: another guy out in the Santa Cruz
mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, tweaker Rick ended up getting the
great idea of using the skies,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the skies guys pot money that he had
owed them to buy Elton John tickets.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thinking he was going to get scalp
these tickets in the parking lot and make
[SPEAKER_01]: all his money back and double it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, he didn't sell a single ticket
took, you know, everybody he knew to see
[SPEAKER_01]: Elton John.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, ended up stiff in the
sky in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_01]: So his way to pay back the guy in Santa
Cruz was he had introduced them to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I, I was still paying the
tweaker Rick price, but now to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the source, you know,
so he had gotten his money back that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after a while, uh, we had built a
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got some trust, you know, in me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he was like, you know,
then that's when he told me that he was
[SPEAKER_01]: grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: He invited me over up to the Hills once
and I started trimming for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at this point I'm 18 and then,
uh, he asked me one day he was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to come help, you know,
you want, you want to move out here and
[SPEAKER_01]: help me out?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were doing a hydro set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I didn't know much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know anything back then,
be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were doing a rock wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were growing in Rockwell,
uh, four inch Rockwell cubes on Rockwell
[SPEAKER_01]: slabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, like this is before
carbon filters or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern California, we had three hydro
hydro stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one in Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had one in San Jose, and then we had
one in Santa Cruz, not Santa Cruz in
[SPEAKER_01]: Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think the only kind of products were
out was maybe, uh, earth juice and general
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think there was anything else
out at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, ended up moving to Santa Cruz was
working, uh, for this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like I said, in Rockwell on the slabs
and they had a recycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: System.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the nugs never like filled out really
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, the climate wasn't all that
great, but it's, it's the early nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as it didn't have seeds or if
it was brown, you know, it was going and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting top, top dollar for it back
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the guy was working with, they ended up
opening up a hydro store in the Santa Cruz
[SPEAKER_01]: mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is, yeah, early nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no, this is mid nineties, uh,
nine, probably 97, 96 or 97.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my boss, man, uh, had a set up another
house with this couple living inside of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had just opened up a hydra store
in the Santa Cruz mountains in Soquel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, uh, the DA or I don't think it
was, yeah, maybe it was a DA.
[SPEAKER_01]: They ended up following everybody,
uh, home.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would go to the hydra store.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, it was called operation green fire
and they did it to, you know, I think it
[SPEAKER_01]: was every hydra store we had here in
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it wasn't too many,
but, uh, they were following people home
[SPEAKER_01]: and ended up doing massive raids and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that time, uh, I was at the grow
house, um, early in the morning,
[SPEAKER_01]: my boss, man, wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the door gets kicked down
and, and, you know, here comes all these
[SPEAKER_01]: guys hooting and hollering and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so ended up getting busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, um, my boss, man ended up getting,
uh, six months of work release in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa Cruz area back then, which,
you know, for, for the amount that there,
[SPEAKER_01]: he was growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you were probably, you know,
in Southern California or Eastern
[SPEAKER_01]: California, they would have thrown the
book at you and given you like five to 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years, but, uh, is, you know, out here,
you gotta know your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: The laws and out here, if you live in the
Northern district, the judge back then was
[SPEAKER_01]: very lenient with her where, you know,
the, the judge in the Eastern district
[SPEAKER_01]: would have just thrown the book at you and
you would have been locked up for a long,
[SPEAKER_01]: long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was my first growing experience,
uh, real like growing a perpetual harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they taught me how to clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, so after we got busted there,
I ended up going back to San Francisco,
[SPEAKER_01]: area, um, was doing my thing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and back then I was getting some
really, really good herb, uh, indoor herb
[SPEAKER_01]: from Santa Cruz mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like I remember we had some awesome
big bud and Mongolian indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else was there?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one called the asthma that I've
been looking for, but no one's ever heard
[SPEAKER_01]: of it since.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what else was there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, anyhow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was doing my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Bay, um, I had some of the best
herb in the Bay during the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the, the Canadian, the Canadian,
the BC herb started coming through and
[SPEAKER_01]: prices of herb went from, you know,
uh, quality indoor, like wholesale was
[SPEAKER_01]: 4,000 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this BC herb started flooding in
and it was going for $2,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now no one wanted the quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted the cheap, cheap, cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that pretty much ended it for me
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I moved to Sierra mountains and
that's where I started pursuing my grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only that I had, I had a,
uh, I had my first kid then as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of pushed me into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I went back to school, uh,
got a couple of jobs, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working full time and going to
school full time and, uh, I was growing a
[SPEAKER_01]: little herb in the backyard, had an eight
lighter inside, um, help, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: help get by.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time, so, you know,
I learned with the Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was growing, I started with the
Rockwell and, you know, just, it would
[SPEAKER_01]: just never turn out the way I wanted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I was taught with a
recycling system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only thing I did different was I
ended up, uh, ditching the recycling
[SPEAKER_01]: system and go into a drain to waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just changed the whole setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was night and day just all of a
sudden just turned out amazing,
[SPEAKER_01]: thick buds, you know, super frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was growing train wreck back then and,
uh, nothing but train wreck for like a
[SPEAKER_01]: good solid three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then, uh, man, I lost track
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's, that's, that's amazing so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question I want to ask first off
is, were there any, uh, like kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: prominent breeders back then, or was
everyone still super harsh, harsh about
[SPEAKER_02]: everything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Super, super hush, hush, super hush,
hush.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one ever knew what you were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you didn't tell anybody, definitely
didn't like, you know, bring any
[SPEAKER_01]: girlfriends or anything like that around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, very, very hush, hush, you know,
uh, and you know, the only thing you could
[SPEAKER_01]: learn from were the books back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I had all these high times and all
that stuff, ask Ed, but, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was, there was nobody to talk to
about, about it, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, I had, I had friends that
were growing also, but they didn't know I
[SPEAKER_01]: was growing and I didn't know they were
growing at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was always, you know, it was really,
really hush, hush back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what, what was the progression into
your first breeding project and what was
[SPEAKER_02]: like the first cross you made?
[SPEAKER_01]: My first cross I ever made was,
uh, it was Lado Uno or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I forget the name of the seed Lado
Uno.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was Lado Uno or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had, uh, there was a strain going
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called the blue dot, um,
in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone had told me it was this Lado
Uno, you know, and that's, it was just a
[SPEAKER_01]: phenom out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I bought a pack of seeds,
popped them out, um, didn't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, really what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just playing and ended up dusting a
train wreck with a male of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember the seeds just being these
tiny, tiny, tiny little seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which is, is a normal characteristics
when you cross anything, the train wreck,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I thought I fucked it up somehow,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so that was my first real cross or not
real cross, but me just playing around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, I ended up getting the
strain in about, it was probably like
[SPEAKER_01]: 2000, maybe 2002.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was my old high school strain,
cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, back when I was going to
high school, everything was, it was either
[SPEAKER_01]: cat piss or skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was, uh, we didn't really have names
to it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was green or brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: They called a swagger dink, you know,
kill bud, uh, KGB killer green bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I ended up getting this cat piss,
uh, founded in my hometown, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always thought the cat piss was
related to the roadkill skunk back in,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in the, uh, in the nineties,
we, the skunk we would always get would
[SPEAKER_01]: be, uh, it would just be this really light
green, barely any hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would always have these really fat,
uh, uh, sugar leaf that would just coat
[SPEAKER_01]: like cocoon the whole bud, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, uh, so the cat piss is what kind
of got me going really into the breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking that I could find the roadkill
inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it wasn't in there at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just all cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what, uh, kind of got me going
into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just, uh, it's just labor love
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's going to become a sound
bite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying that was so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just all cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, so, you know, I've, uh,
I was blowing glass for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always liked, I've always enjoyed
creating, uh, things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, uh, the breeding is,
is like my art now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, you know, just what,
uh, just creating, making your own strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, digging through, digging through the
seeds, you know, not knowing what's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to pop up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's super, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, uh, really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the gamble of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I love everything about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's why we should pop more
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to talk about that soon,
but just to quickly jump back to the cat
[SPEAKER_02]: piss, I noticed, uh, strains like the cat
piss and including cat piss pop up
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhat commonly on your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more importantly, a lot of people,
you know, generally speak quite highly of
[SPEAKER_02]: it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to find and almost no one really
breeds with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you think it fell off if it is kind
of getting a bit of a resurgence right
[SPEAKER_02]: now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's, it's the same thing with like
the roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, well back then, so mid nineties,
uh, like the cat piss that I'm working
[SPEAKER_01]: with and the name cat piss was just
loosely thrown on anything that had that
[SPEAKER_01]: smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cat piss that I have now is a pure
indica, but like in high school,
[SPEAKER_01]: we would, uh, we would get like,
uh, we would either name the cat piss from
[SPEAKER_01]: the city we bought it from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or from the dealer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we, we have a, the Nate dog piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would get cat piss from this girl,
Claire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we called it the Claire piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the cat piss that I hold right now,
we would get it from this town called
[SPEAKER_01]: Pittsburgh.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we called it the Pittsburgh piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there was another one called the
Danville piss, uh, Tom, the bomb piss,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so now after, you know, growing for so
many years of, of kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we would, the one we'd get from this
guy, Nate, um, it had to be like a super
[SPEAKER_01]: silver haze or some kind of haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was always really airy, really,
you know, really, uh, skinny, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar leaves were like, you know,
a lot of the other ones would be,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, now, you know, looking back at it,
I could tell it had to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in because of some sort just because of
how fat the sugar leaf would cocoon,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just be like one leaf,
uh, one blade would like cocoon the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: entire nugget.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've always had like a similar
suspicion about, cause I noticed that on
[SPEAKER_02]: your feed, uh, purple Indica pops up and
I've always figured that was another cat
[SPEAKER_02]: piss type thing where it was just like a
broad term for many strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that is the case or it was
always referring to one cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: The purple Indica has always been the one
cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, see it's almost counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came from the Pacific Northwest,
uh, now I have seen the purple Indica here
[SPEAKER_01]: in California, but labeled purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I don't know if,
if it's the Garberville purple Kush from a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know if, you know,
if it started in Garberville made its way
[SPEAKER_01]: to the Pacific Northwest, uh, what other
names they call it, they call it the
[SPEAKER_01]: ultraviolet as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purple Indica, um, I think it might
even have another name, but I just can't
[SPEAKER_01]: remember off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so funny you mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I remember the, the first strain
ever really kind of proper captivate my
[SPEAKER_02]: attention was indeed the purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like the, the mislabeled purple
Indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember it was the second time I'd
ever smoked like proper good American
[SPEAKER_02]: weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was something so special about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And looking back on it, one of the first
things I think of is why don't people
[SPEAKER_02]: breed with these or more importantly,
why don't you see like S ones of these?
[SPEAKER_02]: Surely there'd be a demand you'd think.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd think, you know, and back in the day
before, uh, Instagram and I guess before,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uh, the oil craze there was,
you know, those cause, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a hundred percent of the market was all
buying flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's like, you know, 50% of the
market's buying flour and the other 50% is
[SPEAKER_01]: buying oils now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we lost a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now, it's also big, uh,
you know, it's, it's whatever the jungle
[SPEAKER_01]: boys has grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what people want and, and,
uh, whatever is all hyped up or whoever's
[SPEAKER_01]: rapping about what is just what the market
wants now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like a lot of these good classics
are going extinct and, uh, people are
[SPEAKER_01]: missing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's a, there's a lot of great
weed, but you know, they just want that
[SPEAKER_01]: picture picture perfect, uh, herb that's
on Instagram that everybody's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, hyping about and, and you know,
they're, they're, they're going to miss
[SPEAKER_01]: out on a lot of these good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: These good classics that we had also that,
that, that purple indica is, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a real finicky plant and it's,
it's kind of a pain to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's, that was another reason
why it never really picked up like a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of other strains did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in regards to concentrates,
do you feel like the, the growing demand
[SPEAKER_02]: of consumers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wanting things like say vape cartridges
and just, you know, dabs, whatnot
[SPEAKER_02]: distillates in general is going to have a
negative impact ultimately on the growing
[SPEAKER_02]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, uh, I know, I know a lot of old
timers, you know, there's, there have been
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking their whole lives and they don't
even smoke flower anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just go to the cartridges now on the
pens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, uh, it doesn't smell for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could keep it in their pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could puff it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's, it's changing and it's changing
really, really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole, the whole, uh, the whole ganja
culture that we had out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, it's, it's definitely going to
be a thing in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like in the next 10, 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how can we raise kind of this issue
in the broader mindset of the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the consumers community, I guess,
because I think something which is kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: implied in this whole discussion is that a
lot of the people buying these cartridges
[SPEAKER_02]: are probably just Joe Blow and they
probably, you know, don't know much about
[SPEAKER_02]: the majority of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think we should try to put some
information out there or do you think like
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, you know, like you can't force
someone to be like into something,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to speak?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't think you could force people
into, you know, people like what they like
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and, uh, they like things that are
easy and those cartridges are easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I mean, people that have
smoked in their whole lives or,
[SPEAKER_01]: or, uh, smoking you know, a flower their
whole life or, or just switching over to
[SPEAKER_01]: the pens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It blows me away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've tried a couple of pens here and
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried some that where they add the
fake flavoring and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I ain't going to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: They taste good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It knows it's, it's, it tastes like candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them, and it does kind of work,
but for me, it's not, it's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't like the dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the pens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, I like to roll up a big
fatty and kick back and I like to enjoy
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, I eat, I like to eat my food
slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to smoke my, you know, I like to
relax with my weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so the, the, the oil thing in the pens
has never been my jam, but even the
[SPEAKER_01]: younger generation now, um, like I know my
kids' friends, they're always telling me
[SPEAKER_01]: that they say like, you know, they've
never smoked herb before.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've only taken dabs, which just blows
me away.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that in mind, do you have to keep
this type of a consumer demand in mind
[SPEAKER_02]: when you breed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you kind of reluctantly make plants
which may be more inclined to concentrate
[SPEAKER_02]: production or is it an afterthought?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's, uh, I breed for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, uh, the weed that I breed is
the weed that I enjoy smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I mean, I guess, I guess the real
reason why I started was that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I don't want to lose these,
like, like, you know, the roadkill skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: is completely gone for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, I don't want to lose
OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want, you know, 20 years from now,
it'd just be completely gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything is, uh, has been like,
it's the majority of stuff has been what I
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I like, I like, uh, it's gotta make my
mouth water.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't make my mouth water,
I don't want anything to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and it's not getting high,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two, two very good criteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to get into some serious good
stuff here, but the first thing I wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: to throw out, I wanted to put you a little
bit off foot here and say that chem four
[SPEAKER_02]: has got to easily be my least favorite of
the chems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's your job.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your job to change my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I got a thing that I do with like
the sour, the sour D and the chem were,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I lose half my yield, but I root bound
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and when I do that, uh, you know,
as long as you can get your, as long as
[SPEAKER_01]: you keep it healthy and root bound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll grow them out in a one gallon pot
and I'll leave it inside there,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and I budge for a month and then
I flower them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I find is with both the sour D
and the chem four, uh, is the buds become
[SPEAKER_01]: much smaller, but much tighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, like the, I don't know if it's
just like the potency goes up or what,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for my body chemistry, that chem four
works really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had gotten the, um, the chem 91
originally before I got the chem four and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, that came straight from skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was, uh, doing some work over at my
neighbor's house one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I went over there and we just
started talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, he had mentioned,
uh, the, the chem 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the first time I had heard about the
chem 91 was from, I think maybe I read it
[SPEAKER_01]: in high times or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going like for $600 an ounce in New
York city.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, the best weed ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second time I heard about it
was I was at a, uh, harvest party and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, not so dog was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Jack Herrera was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Kyle Cushman, uh, Eddie Lep's always
at these things too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, at that party talking to not so
dog, he had also mentioned the chem 91,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm already intrigued.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm hearing $600 an ounce in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the best weed, the strongest,
you know, this, that, and the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, I begged him for a cut
and he was like, no, it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: him and his crew had a pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, fast forward to a year or
two later, I met skunk VA over at my
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbor's house and, you know,
he saw him in story and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: similar stories as, as not so dog told me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew it was legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, he had also told me he was
like, you know, I've never given out a cut
[SPEAKER_01]: of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I told him, I was like,
you know, you know, I'm breeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, playing around and I was
like, you know, let, let me work it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'll give you back every
step of seeds that I make from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, so he, he ended up, uh,
give him kicking me down a cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I grew it out a bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my first cross with it was,
uh, I had, uh, back cross three,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Bubba Kush, and then, uh, use the mail
of that and hit the chem nine 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from that, I think I did another,
uh, back cross to the chem 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at this point, I was partying a
lot during these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one day I took off for like two days
and I left my seeds out, um, out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I left the jar, the lid open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I came back home, the jar was
completely emptied.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the, uh, the packages of seeds had a
little holes in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a bunch of right,
uh, mouse or rat shit all over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had eaten like a good, like six,
seven years of breeding work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, yeah, it totally sucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I shared, I shared a shit
ton of seats, a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, tracked everybody down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you know, can I get those
back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I get those back?
[SPEAKER_01]: And slowly, you know, gathered as much as
I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then, uh, inspector got the chem,
you know, one, two, three, four,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he had kicked those down and I grew
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, uh, the chem 91 to me reminds me
a lot of OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I had a jar, um, and this is just
me, this is my, my flavor, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: my, my taste buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not going to be the same for
everybody for, but to me, it reminds me a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I had a jar of, you know,
like chem 91 or an SFV, I always found
[SPEAKER_01]: myself going towards the OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the SFV, uh, I just found the taste
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then I got the chem four and
all those ones and the chem four and like
[SPEAKER_01]: the chem sis have a real similar flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chem D has a similar flavor to the
chem four and the chem sis, but it's more,
[SPEAKER_01]: it has more of a fuel to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the chem 91 just to me doesn't
smell like any of the other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to me, it smells and tastes like
OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when I stopped, uh, working with
the chem 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually I started with my SFV project
at that point and ended up going with the
[SPEAKER_01]: chem four.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have the sis or the D at that
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so I started working the chem four
and I don't know what it is about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one of those ones that when you,
when you get it right, it, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen a lot of shitty
examples, uh, of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people like, uh, I don't
know, the budgets get real fluffy or they
[SPEAKER_01]: burn it, you know, it's, um, but when you
get it right, man, for me, it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first thing we have to loop back
to, you said, uh, inspector kicked you
[SPEAKER_02]: some cuts of the chem one through to four
and you grew them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, I remember, I remember the
three, maybe I didn't get the one and the
[SPEAKER_01]: two, or maybe I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but at all, I remember this,
I think that I, you know, I can't remember
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones, but the four was the one I liked
the best out of all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember one being more OG style.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grew more of a vine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Do you remember it being sativa?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's the commonly said thing that
like one of them was quite sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was either one or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been so long ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you, you mentioned that, um,
at that point you started working on the
[SPEAKER_02]: SFV line as well as, you know,
having that run in with skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I wanted to ask, cause, um,
he's, he's not the type of guy who like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, often says people's names unless
like, you know, he knows you're cool,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he had, he'd kind of told me that same
story.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had told me, but just without actually
saying names.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess that would mean that,
uh, you are the kind of friend who donated
[SPEAKER_02]: the, uh, the SFV BX line that he's started
his background.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cross project with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave him, uh, so, uh, he gave me the
cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we chilled for, you know, hang out
with them for about a year after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, you know, life just got
busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got busy and we lost contact for
several years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then probably about four years ago,
we had met up at the Emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and at that point, you know,
I had, uh, I had the, I had, I think I was
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much done with my chem four line at
that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I gave them every step of the breeding
process of all the chems that I had made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I had lost a lot of the chem
91 stuff, early stuff from the mice,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, gave them what I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at that same time, um,
I had just finished making, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: SFV back cross twos and I was like,
I also had did a, uh, that cross one,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, F twos as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you know, I hadn't, I hadn't grown
them out, but I just gave it to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, see what he had thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, yeah, but I think the,
the SFV back cross twos that he's working
[SPEAKER_01]: with were, uh, from the seeds that I had
given them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember initially when skunk VA
said to me that he felt the SFV OG or
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe broader speaking, the OG was a good
partner to compliment the chem 91 in terms
[SPEAKER_02]: of like starting a back crossing project.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was something that I hadn't really
heard expressed at the time, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially because in the past,
a lot of chem back cross projects,
[SPEAKER_02]: like if you look at, uh, JJ or at even
res, they'd just use Landrace Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was almost expecting him to say
something like that would be what he would
[SPEAKER_02]: use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when he said, Oh no, I've gone with
this SFV OG BX.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little, it threw me off kilter a
little bit, but I guess at the same time,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's exactly the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been saying this whole interview of
like how OG and chem are really quite
[SPEAKER_02]: similar and complimentary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't, like I said, uh, I think
they're totally related.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I, I've always felt the OG
came from the, uh, the 91, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe from a bag seed or yeah,
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, yeah, I think they compliment
each other very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, to, you know, to the SFV by far is
probably my favorite strain of all times,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, so you can't, can't really go
wrong with that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everything, you know,
even that, when I cross, uh, to the SFV,
[SPEAKER_01]: the actual clone, um, it's similar to the
91, it packs a punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It brings the potency way up on,
on anything you, uh, pollinate it with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's something we definitely hear
commonly spoken about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing I do have to kind of ask and
get it out of the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is South Fork seeds using your chem
for IBL as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, not only there's been a quite a few
seed companies that, uh, I've given seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: to before they even had a seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, um, it breeds well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put my, you know, I put my heart and
soul into these seeds and, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, I try everything out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't, you know, if the cross
didn't work, I go back, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I start over until, until I'm happy with
the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm very selective with my,
with my breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people disagree with it,
but I'm, I'm one male, one female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I reverse, I reverse all my
males so I can see what kind of turps they
[SPEAKER_01]: got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when I was able to go to the labs,
I could get them tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and like, so, you know, if I,
if I select like out of a run,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, let's, I'll select like four or
five males that I find that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this has got what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll cross each male to its own
female of the, you know, the same exact
[SPEAKER_01]: clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just say the chem four line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I'd pick, you know, you know,
four or five of the chem four males that I
[SPEAKER_01]: liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would cross each male to its
own chem four clone, and then I would grow
[SPEAKER_01]: all those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that now I can pinpoint like,
you know, what male did what and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, so like, uh, my,
my, the SFV I've been working on,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, that OGs is probably one of the
hardest strains I've ever worked on trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to get that, that flavor out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been times where, you know,
I found a full blown OG male smells,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, just like OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I back cross it, it comes out
this like water, like watered down OG,
[SPEAKER_01]: almost like a wet cardboard taste and
smell to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so you know, not always does it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, for the most part, I'm able to
cut out all the guesswork when reversing
[SPEAKER_01]: the males.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, the, the, the line's very
stable, you know, every seed comes out,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, chem dog with that chem four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then, you know, for breeding
purposes, it's, uh, you know, depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: what your goal is, uh, it's, it's a,
it's a good start.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the seeds are tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're totally stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not going to get, uh,
you know, a bunch of different variation
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, uh, you know, I, I never,
I never wanted to, uh, the seed making has
[SPEAKER_01]: always just been for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's my hobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's what I enjoy doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never intended to come out with a seed
company and then seeing all these people,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, using my seeds to start up a seed
company, um, kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: lit a fire in my ass and, and pushed me
to, uh, uh, you know, come out with my own
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm spending that was tens of
thousands of dollars on electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, making these lines and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm seeing all these other guys
profiting off of, off my work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them give me credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them don't, um, you know,
this whole breeding world, it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: shady industry to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big fan and I don't know how
much longer I got it in me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, some of the things these people are
doing, it's just, it's just so unethical
[SPEAKER_01]: and just downright shady.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I don't know South Fork,
uh, you know, they must've liked the stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: and they went with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so is that the diplomatic answer or
like, you don't mind if someone's using
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like the same mail that you're
using at the same time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, they're not using the same
exact mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave them a handful of seeds,
but, uh, you know, the seed line's totally
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like any knucklehead can pop out
10 of these seeds and you're, and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to find chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all going to be chem dog mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like, uh, yeah, no,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, so at what point did you
decide to start 707 seed bank?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think it was, uh, uh, inspector and
little hill farms were just kept on
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just like, you know,
uh, all these guys are that you've,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were like, stop giving out your seeds
because everybody had been given the seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: out, uh, to had started up a seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's South Fork, um,
uh, you know, uh, who else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, skunk VA with that, with the,
uh, with the, uh, SFV, um, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know, uh, uh, swamp boy seeds
use, uh, some white diesel seeds I had
[SPEAKER_01]: given them in some of their, in one of
their crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, who else is there?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple, uh, a guy in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what has he got?
[SPEAKER_01]: Chronic culture or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I know he's the, uh, the cat or the,
um, the chem dogs in his line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's another guy, I don't want to
mention their name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, I had traded seeds to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, you know, he gave me the whole,
oh, I got the roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came from, you know, Mendocino Joe,
this, that, or the other traded him seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, I grew out all of his
seeds that they must've been, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: from, uh, some brick weed that he had
picked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just crazy long sativas and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that guy ended up coming out with
this, uh, a seed company and, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, using my chems using the chem four.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he had switched the name to like chem
D or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, if you look at the guy,
the guy's pictures were all obviously chem
[SPEAKER_01]: four and all of that, like I'd given them
the breakdown of how I made the seed line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead of, uh, uh, you know,
using the Bubba back cross three chem 91
[SPEAKER_01]: as my first, uh, as the first donor,
he had switched up the name from Bubba
[SPEAKER_01]: back cross three to, uh, heirloom Afghani
cross the chem 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cross two, uh, can he, and then he's
changed the chem four to chem D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that was just kind of, uh,
I mean, it's, it's very flattering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really honored that these people,
uh, like to, you know, think, think the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds are good enough to use and,
and, uh, breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at that point I was just like,
you know, um, maybe I got something here,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, um, uh, so that that's when I
decided to come out and do my own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm my own, I'm my worst critic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so everything, uh, I mean,
I got, I got a refrigerator full of seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: that, uh, you know, won't ever release or,
uh, you know, I just give them out,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, but it just, they just didn't reach my
standard or, or, you know, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of strains where, you know, like,
like the cat piss, uh, uh, I tried
[SPEAKER_01]: crossing males to the actual clone,
but the, uh, the traits that I was looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for, like the cat piss flavor and the
smell would have never transferred
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more of the structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then that's when I was like,
okay, I got to make this cat piss into a
[SPEAKER_01]: male form and then try to hit these other
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, boost the potency up on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you got to remember the weed back in
like, you know, the late eighties,
[SPEAKER_01]: early nineties, uh, doesn't compare to the
weed that we have now, just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the really old timers where
they're always like, uh, oh, the aqua
[SPEAKER_01]: local gold or the Panama red or,
you know, this side of the other,
[SPEAKER_01]: it owes the best weed ever back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, if you grow it out now,
it's like, you know, you smoke a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: joints and you try to give it away to
people and then they don't want it and it
[SPEAKER_01]: ends up getting thrown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it just doesn't compare to the
weed nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the strains that I think is
possibly most well-known from your work is
[SPEAKER_02]: the Cush cleaner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us a little bit of a background on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the Cush cleaner actually,
um, the, the original cross was made by
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, is by this really great guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Lauren, really sweet guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, and he was breeding for motor
rebel for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, he, when he gave me the seeds,
um, he called it long bottom leaf and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, it was just an awesome, awesome
producer outside, uh, finished fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: early middle of October, huge,
huge light green buds almost had an
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor, but it's really high in like
mercy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, kind of that train wrecky flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I was saying, I had grown that
train wreck for so many years straight and
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked it for so many years, uh,
you know, nothing, but it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that, that flavor, um, and that smell
that terpene profile just kind of makes me
[SPEAKER_01]: cringe, but everybody else loved,
loved the, uh, long bottom leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they hated the name and every year,
you know, I'd go back to Lauren and I'd be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Hey, you know, I need, I need a few
more hundred seeds, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he, he was just like, take the mail,
make your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so he gave me the cut of, uh,
he's the Jack's cleaner mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so he gave me the cut of the mail,
uh, ended up making my own seeds and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, hit, you know, hit the SFV with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I also hit this blockhead that I had
grown out for years and years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That actually the blockhead is what I had
grown before I started growing the Cush
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaner as a major outdoor crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, potent, potent, potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the, the mail was just a stud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything he touched just became huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but it also gave off that,
that Jack mercy, um, flavor and smell to
[SPEAKER_01]: everything it touched.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, yeah, anyhow, Lauren gave me the
mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up making my own seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the name long bottom leaf wasn't
really flying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a bunch of my tremors, you know,
they were like call a Cush cleaner and
[SPEAKER_01]: then that's when the name stuck to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not, it's not my, uh, you know,
I just recreated, uh, the seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um, not my, you know, it wasn't my
work at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it definitely all came from
Lauren.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe a good 10 years ago,
uh, Lauren had lost the mail and then,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, my, I had also lost the mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he, uh, he then got some more Jack
cleaner seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And recreated it, um, but calls it now
just, uh, calls it long bottom rather than
[SPEAKER_01]: the long bottom leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's not, uh, the identical
or anything like that as the original one,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um, still I'm sure it's, it's pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's a really cool story as a
bit of a side note.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, um, I think I tried that new one
because I think I could be wrong here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think he had to use the Jack's
cleaner too, instead of the original one,
[SPEAKER_02]: just due to what TGA is releasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what had happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's such a small world because I
actually, he ended up making a little
[SPEAKER_02]: freebie project where it was that new one
he made that mail, uh, cross to gorilla
[SPEAKER_02]: glue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like a freebie cause you know,
like a little hype thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some, yeah, I got some of those
seeds, grew them out, found an all right
[SPEAKER_02]: leaning female and then crossed it to this
Chernobyl, but oh my God, it tapped into
[SPEAKER_02]: that long bottom and it's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was so funny just hearing you talk
all about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, I don't know if Lauren still
breeds with, uh, is still breeding for
[SPEAKER_01]: motor rebel, but I know he, he had also
used, uh, uh, the chem four, the my seed
[SPEAKER_01]: line of chem four and some of his lines
and he had also used, uh, a pineapple tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of this, and some of his work
there, but I'm not too sure if he had
[SPEAKER_01]: released them with motor rebel or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, either way, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to dive into it later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to ask you about the pineapple tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause this is on the website and it's so
interesting to me because you don't often
[SPEAKER_02]: hear about pineapple tie, you know,
like, I mean, chocolate, cherry tie stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all the commonly spoke about
ones with pineapple, a rare one,
[SPEAKER_02]: or is there a bit more of a story behind
it than it's just simply.
[SPEAKER_02]: A pineapple Thailand race.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I got the clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's, it's a cut that's been going
around men's, you know, for quite a few
[SPEAKER_01]: years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it came to me as a clone only
strain and, uh, but we're working through,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it smells and tastes just like
pineapples.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, I mean, a strong order odor of
pineapple, but when I was, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: working it into seed line, there's
definitely, uh, some haze inside there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that, that, you know, that just that
spicy, uh, I don't know how to describe
[SPEAKER_01]: the haze, but just that classic haze
smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, uh, have you ever tried the NL five
haze back in the day or the cough or the
[SPEAKER_01]: dog shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I know some people disagree with me
and I could totally be wrong, but I've
[SPEAKER_01]: always thought like the Colorado cough and
the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, dog shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all just Northern white five haze
just, you know, renamed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but there was definitely some of that
inside there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, big plant, um, indoors, it's real
light green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but just like I said, a strong,
strong, ripe pineapple, um, with,
[SPEAKER_01]: with a slight hazy, you know, aftertaste
to it, um, makes my mouth water every time
[SPEAKER_01]: just even talking about right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to salivate a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you know it's a good herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just some of the other strains,
which kind of caught my eye off,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that we're on the front page of
the site, the UK cheese, this is one which
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't get a mention anymore for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most people are aware, you know,
it kind of comes from the skunk number one
[SPEAKER_02]: stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think some people may be regarded as
a bit weaker in potency, like kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: a bit of a strain of yesteryear as DJ
short would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think, do you think people are
missing the boat with this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, again, it's, it,
it, it, it isn't as potent as,
[SPEAKER_01]: as the weed as today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but man, that, you know, that flavor
to it is just unreal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so some people are really turned
off on it and some people really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I myself really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so that, that one, um,
actually came out really turned out really
[SPEAKER_01]: good with that chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the chem dog, uh, gave it a little
bit, uh, an extra kick to it, added some
[SPEAKER_01]: potency and lightened up the color a
little bit on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part it's, uh,
it retained all that cheese flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even the structure of the plant is,
is, uh, mostly cheese, but with the chem
[SPEAKER_01]: dog, just, it did add some, um,
potency which was definitely needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, but like, I don't know that the
taste of that cheese, I mean, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, this might sound like a bit of a
silly question, but the, the exact source
[SPEAKER_02]: of the skunk that the UK cheese comes from
a little bit ambiguity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause obviously, you know, skunk's been
offered by a lot of different seed banks
[SPEAKER_02]: at a lot of different times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it was from the, uh,
you know, widely regarded as less ideal
[SPEAKER_02]: sweeter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Skunk stock or probably from the earlier
stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was from the earlier stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the, the, the, the later stuff of the
skunk number one, to me always had a,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, perfumey, uh, smell to it,
a sweeter perfume, um, where, where this
[SPEAKER_01]: one is just, uh, I mean, I've never tasted
herb like this from anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's, it's special.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's special that the turf profile off of
it is just unreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I had a cheese S one before
that was insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can only imagine the original was
just the icing on the cake with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something I did want to run by,
I noticed not only on the website,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also on my Instagram a fair few times
I've seen lava cake pop up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I wanted to ask was obviously
give us a bit of a rundown on lava cake,
[SPEAKER_02]: but more importantly, what do you think it
is about the cookies and chem combo that's
[SPEAKER_02]: so alluring to people?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's purely a hype thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think it's beyond that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I, you know, I think there's too
many cookie and chem hybrids that work for
[SPEAKER_02]: people to just be doing it for like a
market reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do you think it works well and
what about them do you think blends well
[SPEAKER_02]: together?
[SPEAKER_01]: It works well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, um, the chem male that I use,
uh, is a blank male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, meaning the, uh, the females
completely take over the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, rarely do I get in any of like the,
uh, the chem crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, will you get that chem, uh,
flavor or structure or anything with,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the male that I have that I've been
using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so with the lava cake, uh,
I use the, uh, thin mint with that cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I, when I grew all those out,
like I got every single Fino of,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, cookies imaginable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that short little indico,
which is like the OG KB.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I got like, you know, the,
the lanky one, like the forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got the, you know, a nice big
yielding, um, like the, like the thin mint
[SPEAKER_01]: and then a few others, I think out of,
uh, I did a big run of them inside of a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse and out of all of them,
there was only one that ended up being a
[SPEAKER_01]: light green, like something that hadn't
seen before, but, um, there's definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: some interesting stuff in that lava cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, uh, you know, the, the name,
uh, I just, uh, had somebody on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_01]: pick out the name for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, did like, well, you know, a little
contest, but I know there's quite a few
[SPEAKER_01]: different breeders now that actually use
that, uh, the lava cake name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know if, I don't know if they
used it first or I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, there's so many breeders out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to keep track of now of all the
different names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's almost easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to go with, uh, instead of naming a
strain, just, just write down the lineage
[SPEAKER_01]: of what it is and let it be that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last thing I wanted to kind of probe
into in regards to the lava was you say it
[SPEAKER_02]: uses the thin mint cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is of curiosity to me because,
you know, of all the people we've asked on
[SPEAKER_02]: the show, we still can't really get a
solid ruling on what the thin mint is.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was the original, how does it differ
to the forum really?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, overall, what do you think
cookies is, uh, definitely OG definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: has some kind of OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, um, I think any, uh, you know,
my, I think any new strain out now,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, to, to meet the, uh, you know,
modern day criteria of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: their potency and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it all needs all has to have a
little OG mixed into it to get that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that potency up to, to today's,
you know, um, up to par to today's weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, definitely, definitely some cookie
or a OG inside there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole, uh, Durbin thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I don't buy that one bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't see any bit of Durbin inside
there at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown out every single seed company
there was that had Durbin and they all
[SPEAKER_01]: have a very strong, uh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Trippinoline, um, fluffy buds,
you know, outdoors, they would always
[SPEAKER_01]: finish extremely early, but, uh,
yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've talked to these, the cookie guys
before, and each one kind of gives me a
[SPEAKER_01]: different story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't even think they know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the other question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we trust anything that comes at a camp
cookie fam?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, I, I, I trust, uh,
CSI humble, I trust not so dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't keep track to all these people out
now or, or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been, uh, I've been fed a lot of
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been fed a lot of fake cuts,
uh, and a lot of fake ass seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of just left me to this point
where I do my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I enjoy talking to inspect,
uh, about breeding and this, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the other, uh, you know, we have,
we have, uh, different taste buds and
[SPEAKER_01]: herb, uh, but you know, it works out well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I can run stuff off of him and,
and, uh, you know, he does, he does the
[SPEAKER_01]: homework and finds out, you know,
about this, that, and the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's always nice to pick his
brain and, and see what's what,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, you know, throughout growing out all
the Durban's that, yeah, I don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see that one bit inside the
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I've, I've, I've grown
strains in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, uh, some Dutch stuff that had cookies
profile, you know, little buds,
[SPEAKER_01]: lanky, lanky, uh, plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but as, as for the, uh, the genetic
makeup of the cookies, I couldn't tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to agree with like everything you
said there, especially the Durban.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having been able to smoke a bit of it
myself and see the growth structure and
[SPEAKER_02]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's totally overrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the, the percentage of what people
say it could be in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another funny little side note,
like when you said, uh, you enjoy talking
[SPEAKER_02]: to, uh, inspector, you know, he does his
homework.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, that's the, I remember I made
that exact comment to him at, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: Emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just looks at me and goes,
do you ever wonder why they call me
[SPEAKER_02]: inspector?
[SPEAKER_02]: He just walks off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does his homework.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess to summarize it all up,
you know, we've speculated on the genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: of cookies and we were talking about
cookies and cam.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your speculation on the genetics
of cam?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the cam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you, what do you reckon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, definitely, you know, after,
after growing out those Hermes seeds that
[SPEAKER_01]: I had gotten from skunk VA, uh,
you know, I think some kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's definitely a hodgepodge of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, definitely see that like a Pakistani
style, something in there, some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: indica, uh, but, you know, who knows,
who knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another strain from kind of the old
school, which no one can really give me
[SPEAKER_02]: too much info on, but I got a hunch you're
going to be the one to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Old Betsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give us any story on her?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, old Betsy came from, uh, a buddy of
mine from overgrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went by budgler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he had brought in the Betsy up to
humble back in the early two thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, from what information I gather,
it's the same guy that did the hog's
[SPEAKER_01]: breath and the bull rider who was also did
the, uh, the old Betsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I've asked around,
um, and just like, you know, breeding with
[SPEAKER_01]: it, seeing the different stuff that pops
up, I kind of believe the white widow,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe super skunk cross or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but again, you know, this is all
speculation, but I think, um, for sure,
[SPEAKER_01]: the white widow, I've grown out quite a
few white widows in the past and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: see that in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but again, uh, I think whoever was
grown at a long time ago is long gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, uh, it's going to be another one
of those mystery plants that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe when Phyllis gets enough,
uh, stuff gathered up, they'll be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: tell us in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's it like as a, as a smoke,
you know, what's the flavor?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the high?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so a lot of the, uh, a lot of my
breeding, um, the past 10 years has been
[SPEAKER_01]: for commercial outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so the Betsy, um, very pungent,
this like rotten mango or maybe like a
[SPEAKER_01]: baby ate a ton of mangoes and then shit
them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funky and the smell it's,
it's got a really, really strong,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, uh, turf profile to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, uh, the thing I really liked about it
was, um, how quick, how fast it finished
[SPEAKER_01]: outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually about October 5th for us over
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, October 5th to like, uh, you know,
if you wanted to, like, I guess maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: October 15th, the latest latest now,
uh, October 5th, about October 8th is
[SPEAKER_01]: usually when I cut it, um, big,
big, big yielder, very hardy and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then just the, uh, the, the,
the turf profile on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that stuff can sit for a solid year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you open it up, it's just going
to stink like it did from day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've had people, you know,
take that over OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they, they loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's a good, it's a good daytime
smoke, uh, pretty, pretty, pretty heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: duty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what else?
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, more, more for the outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, is, is what I started working.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got, you know, for outdoor,
there's certain types of herb that,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, when done right outside has an indoor
look to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Betsy being one of those, um,
a lot of breeder Steve stuff from back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the day, uh, had some really nice,
uh, would have a really nice like indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: look to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one, uh, a blockhead that I've
been working for several, several years
[SPEAKER_01]: now from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that, that, I mean, for the longest
times, like when the dispensaries first
[SPEAKER_01]: started opening up out here, I was taking
it in and passing it off as indoor and
[SPEAKER_01]: they were loving it and they were taking
it and giving me top dollar all the time
[SPEAKER_01]: for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, so the Betsy is another one like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's just got that,
that look, um, to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's got the, it's got the nose to it
and it's got the structure to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so it was one, you know, I couldn't
let it pass up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I worked that into, uh, uh,
in bread line, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just kept on back crossing it and,
uh, it's, it's a winner for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name of it, um, turns a lot of people
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most, most times, uh, I've seen it
being passed off as Oregon blueberry or
[SPEAKER_01]: mango Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is a couple of other names,
but again, it was just, it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: cashcropper back then for the indoor and
it's a cashcropper now for the outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, and it does great inside as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you kind of take a look overall at
707's offerings as a seed bank seems to me
[SPEAKER_02]: on face value, it's pretty evenly split
down the middle in terms of kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: Sativa and Indica's.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess you could argue a little
more Indica leaning with, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the chem hybrids, but overall,
you know, was that kind of intentional?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you look to cater to both sides of the
market or is it really just about you?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, yeah, I hate to say it,
but it's all, it's just, uh, what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tend to go more towards the
Indica's, but you know, I do like a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of Sativa here and there, not,
not anything super heavy Sativa,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the genius from brother Grimm's
actual genius clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that thing, this is just makes my
head spin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start hearing things on the walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like all I want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, genius.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when I got to smoke genius,
I just exhaled and just within about five
[SPEAKER_02]: seconds, I just looked at soul and was
just like, this is my new favorite plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the first time I grew the
genius and flowered it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had harvested it, had it in my garage
and then, uh, left came back a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: hours later and I had thought somebody had
thrown up in my house and like didn't get
[SPEAKER_01]: it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That smell was just like, wow,
something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that smell and the taste of it,
but, uh, it just makes my head spin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my head already go, um, you know,
I already go a thousand miles per,
[SPEAKER_01]: per minute here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I don't need anything else to
increase that, you know, I need something
[SPEAKER_01]: to calm me down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess it would be safe to say,
overall you're definitely more into your
[SPEAKER_02]: Indica's than Sativa's.
[SPEAKER_01]: More, more Indica hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely liked the blend, you know,
pure, pure Indica's of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they lay me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I got an army of kids, so it's,
it's pretty hard to function if I,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I smoke too much of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I like, uh, a nice blend,
not nice hybrids of, uh, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: but more, I guess, I guess more Indica
domino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, a little while back, you mentioned
that you were reversing the mails.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, you did it for all of your
mails that you are going to like kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: green light.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had people talk about this process,
but no one's ever really, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: said that they've actually really done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you be able to give us a bit of a
run through of what it's like?
[SPEAKER_02]: And more importantly, what's the bud like
when you smoke it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And does it give like a real true
representation of the mail or is it more
[SPEAKER_02]: just kind of hinting things to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it, uh, I'd never smoked it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the, the stuff I use is called floral
and, um, it's a bear product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's definitely really toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so yeah, like, I mean, when I spray
the plants, um, you know, I'll spray them
[SPEAKER_01]: outside and then I don't even touch the
plant, um, for a good while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really like telling people use it
because, uh, you know, most people are
[SPEAKER_01]: stoners and they're just going to spray it
without any kind of covering or,
[SPEAKER_01]: or respirator or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, you know, I'm, I don't know what
it could do to you, but I know it's toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, uh, it's banned in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, that, that says a lot right
there, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but what you get off of it is,
uh, the turf profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can definitely, you know, since I'm
always after, you know, a certain turf
[SPEAKER_01]: profile, this is like a weed out all the
shit that I don't want anymore,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then when I was able to take them
to the labs, uh, you know, you could get
[SPEAKER_01]: it tested for potency and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gives you, you know, a slight
little idea, but when you reverse it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just, it just produces, I mean,
I guess I've had some strains that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually produce a nugget, but most times
it's just like a little seed calyx.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, just, and it just goes
up the stem kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what's that string green spoon,
grim spoon or something like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Grinspoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out similar to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and structure, but you can get the
turf profile, which is what I'm after all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, it cuts out all the
guesswork and breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there was just recently a,
uh, post by Mr. Bob Hemphill where he has,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was just yesterday actually,
um, where he had posted a thing where he
[SPEAKER_01]: had gotten some O'Hawken seeds or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he only ended up with one male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so in that, you know, in that case,
he could, he could reverse that male
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're able to get both male,
when you, when you reverse a male and make
[SPEAKER_01]: male us ones, most people would think
you're getting all male seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the, uh, the male carries both
chromosomes, the X and Y.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get both male and female seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, in that case, you know,
since he wasn't able to get any females or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that, now you're able to,
he can reverse the male pollinate itself
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, go through the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you have both male and female
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I've done that with, uh,
like the CAPTIS before where I've made,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, male us ones, I guess you
would call it and, uh, grew those seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I read a thing on, uh, where Sam,
the skunk man said, you know, do you get a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain percentage of males, certain
percentage of female, this, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the other, but, uh, I ended up pretty
much, no, I ended up with a pretty much a
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 50 split, you know, the same amount of
females as males when I did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, I remember that article.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said it was a 25% male, 25% female,
50% have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, I think that's a strain
dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you working with the hermy or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: The, uh, the CAPTIS that I have,
it's, it's, it's stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've never seen any kind of intersex
with it or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even with the seeds there,
there was no herms whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, when I had did the male last one
project and, and, uh, again, it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was a good split, you know,
50 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everything sounds great in theory,
but man, you don't really know what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get until you grow them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not, not all males cross the
same, you know, that's why, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I pick out all my males, I do,
one male to one female, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and now I can grow all those out and
pinpoint exactly what male is doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, uh, like, and like I was saying with
the, like the OG thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I found a few males that smelled like OG,
you know, completely like OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I would cross it back to the SFV,
it would get this watered down carb.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them turn out like the fire OG
really, really frosty, but just not much
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And taste to it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess the thing which comes to mind
then is, um, uh, we, in regards to these
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds, do you think there is anything
valuable to be gained in them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like these mouse seeds, or do you think
it's more of just a novelty thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you're wanting to go deep inside,
you know, inside of what it is to see
[SPEAKER_01]: what, uh, you know, what, what kind of
heritage it might've had or, or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it could be valuable or,
you know, and, and, and like Mr. Bob have
[SPEAKER_01]: pills situation where he only has one male
and that's it and no other seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, reverse that sucker and,
and, and, uh, you know, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get both male and female seeds out of,
out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're able, you know,
go deeper inside of it and see what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the, the reversing of the males,
it, it, it cuts out all the guesswork for,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so there's no more questioning,
you know, what is this going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you never know what it's going to
do, but you can always pick out the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the, uh, the terpium profile or here's
a great example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a few years back, uh, I want to do a
CBD line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had bought a bunch of, uh,
seeds online.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember there's some like reefer man
stuff and some other people's stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew them all out, um, reversed all
the males, took all the males to the lab
[SPEAKER_01]: to see, you know, what kind of percentage,
what things had, none of the seeds that I
[SPEAKER_01]: had bought had any CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all came back THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, like situations like that,
you know, it's, it saved me, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a few, quite a bit of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's questionable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I noticed when you reverse a
female, the female plant itself tends to
[SPEAKER_02]: not really want to accept the pollen and
form any S1s on itself, but I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: confident.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed when I was looking a little
closer at some of your photos of the
[SPEAKER_02]: males, that it looked like it was making
seeds on itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the case?
[SPEAKER_02]: And why do you think there is this
difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, when reversing the females,
I guess a lot of times when you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're spraying it with the silver
nitrate or whatever, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're, you're burning up the,
uh, the pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking about it, but, uh,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, with, with the males, it's every time
I reverse them, it seeds itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and that's one of like the downfalls
of when I would take it to the lab because
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds and the STEM and all that bring
the testing way down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are always asking me like,
you know, what, what kind of numbers are
[SPEAKER_01]: you getting from your males?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, you know, it's only like 12
to 14% but you know, most of that sample
[SPEAKER_01]: is, is seed and STEM, you know,
there's, there's very little calyxes or to
[SPEAKER_01]: test off of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with the male traits that you're
assessing when you reverse, let's just
[SPEAKER_02]: say, you know, you, you're smelling the
terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you found that what it expresses in
the female reverse trait is what it will
[SPEAKER_02]: pass on in its pollen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The majority of the time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's pretty reassuring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not in every case, but,
but most times, yeah, it does pass off,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, the traits that pass off to
the female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most males, in my case, I guess have,
uh, usually take over the cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, when you, when you find a
blank male, uh, it's, it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: something special and hold on that sucker
tight when, you know, the females
[SPEAKER_01]: completely take over the cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, those are the real special ones that,
um, and I don't, I don't, I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands and thousands of males.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only found like one or two in my life
that do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kind of plays into the idea of,
I've been thinking about this for a while,
[SPEAKER_02]: that people buy strains predominantly for
the female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, when I was buying,
uh, seeds, you know, the description sold
[SPEAKER_01]: me, uh, and, you know, nine out of the 10
times, uh, you might find one seed out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the pack that would actually be what the
description is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's why I like the back
crossing and stabilizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, if, if you're reading my
description, that's what you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get one out of 10,
you know, every single seed of the heavily
[SPEAKER_01]: work lines that I have is coming out
exactly what I say it's going to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like the Betsy's, they're all
turning out how it's described,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the cat piss, every single one
comes out these short little indica,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, cat piss, you know, um, no variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like, uh, for doing commercial
outdoor, it was, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to be able to grow out,
um, let's say like, you know, 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 seeds and every single one turned out
exactly the same to where, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you can mix the different plants
together and no one's going to know a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, uh, if, if like, if I'm buying a
pack of seeds from somebody else,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, and you know, I'm growing them out and
I got three or four different kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: phenos, uh, the end user isn't going to be
happy if I call it all one thing when
[SPEAKER_01]: there's three different, you know,
flavors out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was, uh, the big driving force
behind the, uh, making outdoor seeds is
[SPEAKER_01]: just having that consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, obviously the seed is going
to get twice the yield as a clone is,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, you know, a lot more resistant to
pests and mold and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, just kind of slotted this one
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you ever consider offering any
feminize work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I love feminize seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love feminize seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I make them for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I do more for preservation of,
of clones that I want to let go,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, of feminize, make S ones and,
uh, put them in the vault.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing I've found with, you know,
a lot of the, you know, when you're making
[SPEAKER_01]: an S one of one strain, um, it doesn't
generally turn out as well as if you,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, make a hybrid with S, you know,
um, make feminize hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those usually turn out much better than
actual the, uh, when, when making the S
[SPEAKER_01]: one, but, uh, you know, I got them in the
vault.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in 20 years from now, if I want to
grow, you know, this side or the other,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can always just bust them out and sprout
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I'm sure, you know, out of,
out of 10 or 20 seeds, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: find exactly what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, as of offering them to the
public, I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what the future of 707
seed bank has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the, uh, like I said, that this
breeding has always been my passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been my hobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, now kind of bringing it into a,
into the market zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm always scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to cloud my judgment a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, uh, everyone wants this
purple punch or, or a wedding cake or this
[SPEAKER_01]: side or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've, I've smoked purple punch a
few times and, uh, there was no punch to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tasted good, but there was definitely
no punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's what it seems like the
market wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all want these, uh, whatever jungle
boys is growing is what they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, uh, the, the lemon tree S one,
um, I have a buddy who was, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: the lemon tree guys is distributor when
they first came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, as, as he was moving the
packs, he would always find a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds inside each pack and saved them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wasn't great.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wasn't growing at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does now, but, uh, he gave me,
um, all, all the lemon tree Hermes seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: he had found.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I grew them all out, uh,
you know, like, like I said, with the S
[SPEAKER_01]: ones, you know, a good half of them turn
out to be like duds or just really weak
[SPEAKER_01]: grown or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that lemon tree, it's, you know,
it's got that citrusy kind of Calio,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, uh, you know, turf profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and, you know, most of those
tangies and stuff like that for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, doesn't get me all that high tastes
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a couple joints are good,
but after that it's just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, it doesn't do nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the lemon tree, you know, seems to be a
little bit more potent than, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: the majority of the citrusy strains that
I've worked, but it's that flavor on it is
[SPEAKER_01]: just so mouthwatering, so flavorful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, uh, it does pack a good,
good punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you know, like, like, uh,
most S ones it's, it's, it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: bitch to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, has a real weak, weak, uh,
root system to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, same thing with the, uh, I use a,
uh, snowman, um, S one, which is from the
[SPEAKER_01]: cookie guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, one of the ones that they've kind of
held down more on a, uh, uh, they've held
[SPEAKER_01]: that one down pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't let it go at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, uh, again, with the snowman,
also weak roots, uh, very finicky to grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a lot of these uh, S ones,
you know, like, like the SFV, I want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: surprised is that if that wasn't a
hermeseed, even though I've never seen OG
[SPEAKER_01]: Hermi on me, any of them indoors,
but, uh, I imagine, you know, that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: most of all these cuts came out from,
but, uh, you know, weak, weak root system,
[SPEAKER_01]: but awesome flavorful flavorful herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can't, I can't let that stuff
pass up when it, when it's that good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this the same lemon tree S one,
which I think swamp boys have used in a
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrid or two?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, not the same cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, uh, most the, the lemon tree guys
stopped by my booth at the Emerald cup,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I've heard this from other people
before, uh, and they said that they've
[SPEAKER_01]: never given out the actual clone and
everybody that does have a lemon tree,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, cut is comes from, you know,
a seed that they found.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, inside, inside their bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, the swamp boy guys also,
uh, uh, they found their own seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and, uh, grew theirs out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen, uh, I haven't seen her
smoke their lemon tree at all,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody's got a different one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've, I've shared my cut out with a few
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I gave it to archive, uh,
and a couple other folks, but not,
[SPEAKER_01]: not too many.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely not out there at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, is that the one he used in the
creation of the lemon peel line?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who use lemon peel or what's lemon peel?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's, uh, lemon tree cross
something from archive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if, uh, archive have it, it was,
uh, the kettle lemon tree that I gave
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I've tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think it was called lemon drop or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the hybrids he made.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he made a hybrid with lemon tree and
then cross that to other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I got to try the end product.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did that citrusy fun come out into the
cross or, um, well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I also tried lemon tree at,
uh, Mr. Bob Hemphill's place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that sounds much more like what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the one I tried from archive was
just a really nice lemon hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could definitely see that lemon tree
was in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should say, but, um, kind of what you're
talking about is definitely like what I
[SPEAKER_02]: tried at Bob Hemphill's house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what did you think of the lemon tree?
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked it, but I found there was
something a little bit obnoxious about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like obnoxious lemon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was, um, and it's not like the way
he grew it or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just a, my personal
preference thing, but I definitely see
[SPEAKER_02]: what you mean when you say like there's a
Calio vibe to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's almost like not a bang on
lemon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a very tart lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally don't get any lemon out of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's not like the way some OGs are
bang on lemon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like that lemon in my opinion at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel, I feel the same way to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more, uh, uh, like an orangey,
but, um, everyone likes the lemon though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the name's pretty popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an interesting cut nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it spurs the question to mine for me
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen people breeding with S2s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something you were interested in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like not necessarily breeding with an S2,
but like digging to that generation and
[SPEAKER_02]: doing that type of thing or not
necessarily?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't think there's, you know,
there's no right or wrong way in breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you, if you have a goal in mind,
uh, you know, just go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't work, try a different way,
you know, not all strains you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: breed the same, not, you know,
what might work with one strain might not
[SPEAKER_01]: work with another.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, any kind of tool that I could use,
I use it on S1s, S2s, reversing males,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, the, the one, one,
one, one thing, uh, I've noticed with the
[SPEAKER_01]: reversing males and it's, it's something
that I still do to this day is,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the stem rub, you know, before I
reverse a male, I'll go through all my
[SPEAKER_01]: males and I'll rub the stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'll, I'll, I'll pick out
what I think is going to be the killer
[SPEAKER_01]: stud of the group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'll label those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not once has one of those males been the,
the, the keeper stud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually the one off in the far
corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that stem rub thing, uh,
I've noticed maybe 5% of plants that stem
[SPEAKER_01]: rub actually comes through to the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, that stem rub
doesn't mean shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, whatever smell you're getting off that
stem rub, it's going to come out
[SPEAKER_01]: completely different to the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so that's what, you know, another cool
thing with the reversing of the male is
[SPEAKER_01]: just finding these little, little things,
but whatever, any kind of tool,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, whatever I could do to reach my end
goal is, you know, I'll use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, uh, I don't have, uh, any problems
with, with, uh, S1s, S2s, and actually I
[SPEAKER_01]: think, uh, to make a strain tighter and to
breed, like to breed appear, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a real F1.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you do need to go to S2,
S3, S4, um, you know, and then cross that
[SPEAKER_01]: to something else that has also been taken
that far and, and, you know, to get that
[SPEAKER_01]: true, that true hybrid figure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was another reason why I did the,
uh, I like the back crossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, to, you know, back across the hell out
of it to where every seed comes out
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll cross those back to,
you know, a different strain that I did
[SPEAKER_01]: the same thing with in hopes to get a
true, you know, full on vigor F,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, the first thing I kind of
think of is what are some other little
[SPEAKER_02]: tips and tricks you may have for,
uh, selecting a male?
[SPEAKER_01]: The reversing of the male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pick out everything from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I like when I sprout my seeds and
stuff like that, I'll automatically,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, call off anything that's weak or,
or, uh, doesn't, doesn't fit my bill,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, growing wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just keep all the best ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, I'll start reversing
them and then pick it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the thing which comes to my most,
when you mentioned that the, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, how should we say the inter
reliability of the stem rub is,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, our most recent guest mass strains,
he said that something he had noticed,
[SPEAKER_02]: which wasn't exactly what you said,
but it very much was following that train
[SPEAKER_02]: of thought was that he said, uh,
don't put too much stock in a single stem
[SPEAKER_02]: rub, because if you do the stem rubs
consistently over a long period of time,
[SPEAKER_02]: it changes wildly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, if you just stem rub on any
old day, like who knows what that really
[SPEAKER_02]: means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, only, uh, like the,
the cat piss will actually, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the smell will come off on this,
on the stem rub and a lot of those,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, that tangy, like the lemon tree and
those citrusy strains, uh, the stem rub
[SPEAKER_01]: will actually translate to the flower,
you know, but the, the, every other strain
[SPEAKER_01]: I've ever tried, um, not even close,
nowhere near close.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is maybe a bit of a weird kind of
five edge concept, but I really liked the
[SPEAKER_02]: idea of it where basically an old idea DJ
Short put forward was that he always said
[SPEAKER_02]: he found crosses worked a little better
when the more sativa of the two plants was
[SPEAKER_02]: the mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever found anything like that or
found any of your own little kind of weird
[SPEAKER_02]: rules that seem to work like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no, uh, you know, like not,
not all, not all strains are going to mix
[SPEAKER_01]: and match the same, uh, you know,
sometimes like, like, uh, SFV,
[SPEAKER_01]: if, if you cross anything to the actual
SFV clone, it's almost guaranteed the
[SPEAKER_01]: potency goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you cross anything to my cat piss
clone, um, that cat piss smell just does
[SPEAKER_01]: not go through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't, it just doesn't translate
to the crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and I just, uh, maybe about a year or
two ago, I made a bunch of cat piss
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses where I actually use, uh,
a male from my cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and cross it to a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that like had her me tendencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it just brought it right out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like anything, uh, uh, the chem 91 her me
held that the girl scout cookies her me
[SPEAKER_01]: really bad, uh, but strains that didn't
really have any her me tendencies were,
[SPEAKER_01]: were perfectly fine, which was totally
weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I, I, I stress all my mails out for a
good long time, usually just because I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: not home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm unable to use them, but, uh,
I'll be gone for like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a good season and then finally come back
and get to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they're kept in little tiny
cups, uh, you know, half dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if some of them sometimes will start
spitting out hairs and crystals,
[SPEAKER_01]: and at that point, uh, you know,
off to the mulch pile, they go,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, if they, if they can survive
me being absent for that long,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I know I got a keeper, you know,
so there's some strong genetics in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are some of the next crosses
you're looking at working on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm still working on my SFV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, currently got a, um, a seed run going
on that, uh, been working that,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, spice of life blockhead clone for
quite a few years, but more, more of an
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor, uh, project was, so when I breed
for outdoors, uh, verse indoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: I do completely different things for my,
for outdoor breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'll leave all my males outside and to
the very end, uh, see, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going to flower first and under the
natural light, uh, growth structure,
[SPEAKER_01]: this, that, or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, for, for outside,
uh, like right now I'm working on,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to finish up my blockhead this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, uh, the blockhead I used, uh,
the same Jack's cleaner for the Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaner for my original cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I back crossed it twice to the clone,
but the clone would do this thing outside
[SPEAKER_01]: to where like the very tip of the plant
would die off or just one branch would die
[SPEAKER_01]: off on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without fail, like it, you know,
it did it every year, just the clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I started back crossing it,
I started noticing it was actually going
[SPEAKER_01]: through into the, uh, into the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I started, uh, you know,
making F twos, F threes, F fours with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, breeding that part of it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for, for, you know, outdoor seed,
uh, especially with this blockhead,
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, I picked my, this year I took
clones off all the males and just let them
[SPEAKER_01]: all do their thing outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I picked out, uh, several of the
earliest ones to start flowering,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, got those, you know, set aside and
then, uh, uh, you know, take cuts off of
[SPEAKER_01]: the females that are the earliest,
um, that are the ones that are starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: flower first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I'm at right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got clones of everybody set aside the
males, uh, I'll reverse them come this
[SPEAKER_01]: winter inside to see, you know,
which one's got the turf profile I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, from there, then next season,
uh, you know, during, during winter,
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully I'll have enough time to,
uh, you know, cross the males to the
[SPEAKER_01]: females that I like, and then I'll test
them out next year and see what,
[SPEAKER_01]: see what happens or, you know,
what, which stud worked best and carry on
[SPEAKER_01]: from there, doing it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: After the blockhead, uh, you know,
I've, I've wanted the roadkill skunk,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I just think that's that thing is gone
or, um, I've, I've spent tens of thousands
[SPEAKER_01]: of dollars on fake seeds cuts,
uh, driven all over America to find cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: People say they have the cuts,
you know, usually they're just trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: trade for the stuff that I got and they
give me something, you know, completely
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, but I don't, uh, I'd like to work
CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to make some CBD lines,
but I'm just, uh, I got a bunch of these
[SPEAKER_01]: Panama CBD that Mr. Bob had pill gave me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to work those, but as of right now,
the, uh, the labs are all cut off to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't, they won't let me take
anything in to get tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So until I can find a testing facility,
I'm kind of put on hold with the CBDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I was even thinking about,
you know, doing some hemp lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think that might be a thing in the
future, but, uh, really after the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the SFV, if I can ever get that thing
right, I've been going back to it,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, for years and years, just,
uh, thinking I got it right, grew out the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not what I've been looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I start over and we'll see what happens
with that one, but I don't really have,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, much more in the works than what I've
already done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, I think, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I wanted to ask, in relation to
the seed thing quickly was when you do
[SPEAKER_02]: your phenohunting or maybe more
specifically, when you're testing lines,
[SPEAKER_02]: you create, how many seeds do you like to
pop at any one time?
[SPEAKER_01]: As many as I can is, uh, uh, let's just
put it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got chased out of Trinity County by the
police.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they came over to my property,
they said that they were, they would have
[SPEAKER_01]: loved to arrest me, but they didn't have
the manpower to cut down my gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, as much as I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in general, how important is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that people do engage in the
whole kind of art of phenohunting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, uh, a hundred percent, you know,
just what, what you want to find the new,
[SPEAKER_01]: new, or, or something that, you know,
is special to your heart or to your,
[SPEAKER_01]: to your taste buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, gotta pop seeds or we're just going to
be stuck with this purple punch forever.
You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something I surprisingly haven't asked
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned earlier, you know,
you did the whole rock wall slab thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you grow organically now and what style
of growing do you use in general?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I do everything, um, for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, I'm not a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep my soil completely organic,
like no liquid bottles, nothing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic ever will touch my soil,
but I do foliar spray with, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, certain bottle nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that's, uh, but for, you know,
head stash, um, I was doing, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: organics mixing all my amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but then I found a, a super soil that
they make out of, out of out in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they, they use the dragon fly
earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the name of those guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they use their stuff inside the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, works great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just dump a bag, you know, a bag of it
inside of a pot and plant and I'm good to
[SPEAKER_01]: go with straight water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but you know, the, the term organic,
uh, you know, I use drip lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know a lot of people will tell me
it's not organic because I'm using plastic
[SPEAKER_01]: drip lines or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, but, and then for indoor,
um, I learned with general hydroponics and
[SPEAKER_01]: Rockwell and then, uh, later in life,
I did go to all soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I had done organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried, uh, aquaponics before with the
guppies and, uh, ended up just killing all
[SPEAKER_01]: these fish over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I stopped that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've done NFT.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done aeroponics, uh, for,
for, and really I'll just use whatever's
[SPEAKER_01]: free to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there was a company growth science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they sent me like a good, like six
months of, of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use that for indoor, uh, past year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, yeah, it just depends on the
situation where I'm at and what I'm after
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you ultimately prefer organic?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you kind of alluded when you said
head stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, definitely for smoke,
like, uh, herb grown in Rockwell has a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain look to it and like always has
that same kind of certain look to it and a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely sticks out to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could, I could pick it out like night
and day, uh, organics by far for head
stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always turns out the nicest,
the tastiest for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but for outdoor, you know,
like outdoor production, it's just not
[SPEAKER_01]: cost efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like, uh, you don't, you don't
get that extra buck because it's organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only that, most times,
uh, your yield will go down just a slight
[SPEAKER_01]: bit, but for the most, uh, I like to do
that Tom Hill mix, uh, outside and then,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, also as, as a base, it's really
good chicken shit, bone meal, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: oyster can't really go wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been proven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's proven test of time with,
with those old school humble growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been, they've been using that
Stutsman's forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it even flows through into a lot of
the no tool recipes today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something I get asked a lot of
questions about, but sadly I don't really
[SPEAKER_02]: have a lot of answers for is when in
regards to being organic, being an outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: grower, what are some of your tips for
getting the plants big?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like to veg them indoors or you do
like some light depth thing or how do you
[SPEAKER_02]: get them nice and big in veg?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, start from a seed seed always.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I start my seeds about the middle of
March.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get them big inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there I'll put them into a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there they go outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the time they're actually reached
their whole, or their pot or you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever style it's going in, uh,
they're already like a good three to four
[SPEAKER_01]: feet, you know, and then from there,
then you just, uh, just let it do its
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it water, give it sunshine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a plant, you know,
it's a weed that stuff just grows like
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you have a dedicated IPM regime
or how do you deal with pests when they
[SPEAKER_02]: arise?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't really, uh, deal with much
pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, um, uh, everything's pretty clean
inside, uh, before they even go outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, I mean, I don't, I don't do much,
uh, spring for anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, uh, I have been battling,
um, what is it scales for, for a while
[SPEAKER_01]: now, uh, I try ladybugs this side of the
other, but I just, I just, I just can't
[SPEAKER_01]: shake them right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the deal is,
but those things are kind of a pain in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing you may or may not be
experienced with, how do you feel about
[SPEAKER_02]: reeveging cuts?
[SPEAKER_02]: And more specifically, do you feel like it
causes any damage to the cutting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so when I was growing train wreck,
I didn't keep mothers of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted, uh, I just took cuts,
uh, right when, uh, the plant would flip,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would take cuts off of, uh, off the
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did that for about a three,
for three years straight with that train
[SPEAKER_01]: wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never really noticed a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with reeveging plants,
uh, I reevege my seeds all the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, just to save space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I don't have enough space to take
clones off of everybody, uh, even with the
[SPEAKER_01]: females, you know, I'll just grow them
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I like one of them, uh, you know,
I just cut, cut half of it down and then
[SPEAKER_01]: put the rest of it back in the bedroom and
let it, you know, reevege back out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm sure if you kept doing it over and
over and over again for years and years,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, you'd, you'd notice a difference,
but I've never noticed a difference off
[SPEAKER_01]: of, uh, doing it myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's gonna seem a little weird
question, but I definitely want to run
[SPEAKER_02]: this one by especially in light of our
purple punch comments, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of people in general, when they talk
about purple strains, there's kind of this
[SPEAKER_02]: undertone of like how, you know,
purple weed is always weak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems to be, you know, an idea that
comes up again and again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you kind of agree with that in general,
or do you just think it's the purple
[SPEAKER_02]: strains that are currently around and just
maybe not the most potent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no, I think, uh, purple weed and that
like Calio type, uh, that citrusy kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: herb has always been weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's a certain few that pop
out every now and then that, that are
[SPEAKER_01]: really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the purple oracle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that thing's potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It knocks me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but then again, purple oracle is,
is one of those purple strains where you
[SPEAKER_01]: need the cold to make it really purple
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I think generally, you know,
most purple or is generally on the weaker
[SPEAKER_01]: side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Understandable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a few little legal questions before we
get into the tail end of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel that the industry is going
to evolve in light of the legal changes
[SPEAKER_02]: that came to pass with, uh, prop 64.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you feel that it is the impending
death of the mom and pop business?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to say it, but yeah, I think it's,
it's the end of quality herb, quality
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's going to be a lot of,
I don't, I don't, I don't see people
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking weed really in 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like they're all just going to go
to the pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, uh, the flowers is just going to
be a thing in the past, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is just my personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there'll always be that little,
uh, uh, you know, connoisseur group,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, like the micro brew, but for the
most part, uh, I think the whole cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: culture and the mom and pop thing,
uh, California has definitely killed it
[SPEAKER_01]: and are, is trying very, very hard to,
uh, end it and just pretty much let this,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, massive corporate takeover pretty
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you think that, uh, with those
changes, all of the kind of cultural
[SPEAKER_02]: events like the cups and, um, you know,
harvest parties and things like that will
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of forever be different or it'll
still survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The events are done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I think they'll, they're going
to be completely finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, the, the, uh, humble
counties dwindling away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even property values out there,
you know, land that was selling for a
[SPEAKER_01]: million or 2 million a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't even selling for 300,000 now it's,
uh, you know, they killed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humble counties doing this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing without a permit right
now, they sent you a letter and they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: give you a couple of days to cut down your
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't cut it down within those
days, you're going to get a fine for
[SPEAKER_01]: $10,000 a day that every day your garden's
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, 10 grand a day, it made a lot
of people shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people got those letters
already up, up over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that's, you know, they're,
they're, they're going to turn in humble
[SPEAKER_01]: County into a ghost town.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the whole, the whole Emerald
triangle is probably going to become a
[SPEAKER_01]: ghost town in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Property values are just completely
plummeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the, the harvest parties, uh,
you know, those will always be around.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always going to be that small
group of people, you know, who's all
[SPEAKER_01]: stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to share your flowers at the end
of the year, you know, as you smoke mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to smoke some of yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, you know, let's talk, see what's
good, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't see that ever going away,
but, uh, the whole cannabis culture thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think is, uh, definitely dying out very
fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, in the previous question you
alluded to, you know, the connoisseur
[SPEAKER_02]: market, do you think that'll almost become
synonymous with the black market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, just like Colorado,
uh, and all the other states that had
[SPEAKER_01]: legalized beforehand, the laws are going
to, are going to, you know, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: working it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're constantly going to be
changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, uh, they'll, they'll throw us
little guys a bone here and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: not make it so rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, maybe they'll, they'll cut down on
the, on these crazy taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, maybe some of these landlords that are
trying to charge ridiculous prices for
[SPEAKER_01]: warehouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to realize, you know,
they're just wasting people's times.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of, a lot of these, uh, a lot of
these poor investors that are thrown in
[SPEAKER_01]: millions and millions of dollars to hear
some like, you know, 20 year old talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about, Oh, I could do this, make you rich,
rich, rich, you know, they're all going to
[SPEAKER_01]: go belly up in a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the same thing happened in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happened in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to happen here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you could make say one change,
change to the legislation that in your
[SPEAKER_02]: mind, at least would hopefully ensure that
the can of scene kind of continues in a
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy direction, what sort of change
would you want to make?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you feel that no change needs to be
made?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they just need to lower the taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: There, there's nothing left.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing left.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be working your ass off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trying to break even, uh,
you know, each, each city has its own tax
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you got the state tax and it's
just, it's just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: For, for a little grow, I mean,
you know, for a yearly license,
[SPEAKER_01]: some, uh, some of these cities,
you know, want anywhere from 40 to a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred thousand dollars every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then you got, you know,
employees you gotta pay for electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta pay for rent, uh, warehouse
space that would normally go for 80 cents
[SPEAKER_01]: to a dollar per square foot is now
anywhere from three to $4 per square foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's just, there's just nothing
left over.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess as a more international based
question and just one that obviously a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: relevant to home here in Australia,
do you think countries should give up
[SPEAKER_02]: their right to be able to have a personal
grow if it means that they can get access
[SPEAKER_02]: to legal cannabis, but it's being done
through say a big corporation?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if that's all you got,
then yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, if there's any other options,
like, uh, you know, I mean, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the, for the everyday, it's just,
you know, it's not the prop 64 is not all
[SPEAKER_01]: that horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everybody can grow a few plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're not getting thrown in
jail anymore for, well, I guess now you
[SPEAKER_01]: would be able to, or they're going to
start throwing people in jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think anything over six plants again is
a felony out here, which is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, you know, if that's all you got,
then yeah, you know, there's, there's,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better than, uh, you know,
as a kid growing up in the Bay,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I had a, I had a friend that got
some guy unloaded the clip and them for a
[SPEAKER_01]: quarter pound of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was, uh, 1200 bucks back then
in the early nineties and they killed them
[SPEAKER_01]: for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, get, getting rid of that
element.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all about the legalization and get rid
of that whole criminal gangster,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, the way they're,
they're going, they're going around with,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, these crazy taxes, the crazy
regulations, um, you know, that you should
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to use whatever they're using on
our food on cannabis, which you can't,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't even use that, uh, a safer soap
VT for, you know, the caterpillars
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's a good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you know, I'm stuck out there with
tweezers picking off of caterpillars all
[SPEAKER_01]: day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, it's not fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess on the flip side question,
what are you excited for in regards to the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis scene?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, is there any kind of interesting
develops that have really caught your eye
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're a bit optimistic about?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, uh, I'm looking for a new place to
move to, uh, someplace a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: lenient, not as expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, if, if, uh, some corporate
dude wants to hire me, I'd probably take a
[SPEAKER_01]: job at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Bama.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, I mean, we had a good ride for a
good solid 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, it was pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, I had, uh, I had,
uh, some weed taken from me by the
[SPEAKER_01]: sheriffs before, and then they sent me a
letter and they're like, come pick it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they kept it for about a good six
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, when I picked it up out of
the sheriff's office, when I was there,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're like, inspect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what they're like,
you know, take a look, make sure it's
[SPEAKER_01]: still good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they kept it better than I could have.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kept it in a nice, like, you know,
consistent, like 60 degree room,
[SPEAKER_01]: all climate controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was pretty shocked how well they
kept it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So onto the tail end questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are just our little quick fire
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first one, old school strain you wish
you still had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, roadkill skunk, but roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know, I know I sound like the old
timers now with the Acapulco gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was the best stuff, you know,
but that, that old road kills is my
[SPEAKER_01]: childhood weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, I, I, I hear what all
the old school growers are saying about it
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and, you know, why it's not around
anymore, but it's, uh, I miss that flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss that flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss having that, you know, one,
but in my pocket and it's going to stink
[SPEAKER_01]: up the whole grocery store or wherever I
am, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a definitely one which makes the,
uh, the list almost every interview
[SPEAKER_02]: actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what the old timers tell me is,
uh, it sucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, you know, it was a small little
Afghani plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, at the same time,
uh, when the roadkill came out is when,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, is when, uh, you know, the,
the states were allowing a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the Afghani freedom fighters into the
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there was what the Soviet,
uh, went to Afghanistan like 79 to like
[SPEAKER_01]: the late eighties or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, when the CIA got
involved, you know, helping the free,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Afghani freedom fighters, a lot of
them got, uh, you know, were getting
[SPEAKER_01]: refugees.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are played at refugee out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with a lot of them, you know,
they, they brought the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so, you know, there were short
little Indica's and even when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the skunk back in, in like my high
school days, you could, you knowing what I
[SPEAKER_01]: know now, it was definitely Indica's
because of how fat the little sugar leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: were that were cocoon the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so, you know, the old timers saw
me that, uh, that the old roadkill skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: sucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what, what do you mean it
sucked?
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff was great, but you know,
that's, that's when I first started kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of smoking herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, uh, you know, pretty,
pretty much anything back then would have
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten me high, you know, but,
uh, they say, you know, it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was, it was a short little plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a pain in the ass to trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it didn't get them high after,
you know, they, they smoked it a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like, you know, all the,
all the fruits and a lot of the Dutch
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff came through that grew big was,
you know, a lot more stronger and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, easy to trim, you know,
so that, uh, that old roadkill just wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: extinct from, uh, from, you know,
uh, just people not desiring the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the, the, the trades from it or at
least old school growers that were growing
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what in your opinion, is your favorite
strain of all time?
[SPEAKER_01]: OG Kush can't get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That SFV it's, uh, tried and true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works every time, even to this day,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the opposite end of the spectrum,
what is the strain that's least jive with
[SPEAKER_02]: you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, man, you know, I really liked the
flavors of a lot of the hazes and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, but there's the heavy sativa
has got me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of other strands I like
to throw in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old school ones that I miss,
um, in the Tahoe area, uh, we used to get
[SPEAKER_01]: this one called the Afghani queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from the same guy would get one called
the club, uh, and both of them were just,
[SPEAKER_01]: just, um, head twisting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the early nineties,
there was one called the asthma in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa Cruz mountains that he used to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I missed that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else was there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there was a Romulan, uh, not the,
we had two Romulans floating around.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had one that was a short little Indica
piney real piney tasting to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was more sativa that had this like a
grapey, um, like a creamy grape taste to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, that was really, really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miss out one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're starting to think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could probably name off a few dozen
strains that I wish were still around,
[SPEAKER_01]: but so yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I was going to say is to jump back to
the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we, do we get a worse strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: A worst strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no, I can't really think of anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I love it all, but it's all,
I love it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love how they grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I love the flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what would be one that I didn't really
like?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't think of a single one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good problem to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you could go back to one place in
history, and in time to collect some land
[SPEAKER_02]: race seeds, where would you go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, I'm a, I love my Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so probably, uh, the, the Kush
mountain ranges would have to be it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, Afghanistan, Pakistan,
um, you know, nowadays it's, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where you'd be able to find
any true land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost every, uh, country has been watered
down with either Dutch or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: American genetics by now, but yeah,
I would probably say, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, late seventies about the late
seventies in the Afghani region or
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere out over there where things
weren't, uh, didn't get all Dutchified yet
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and, uh, remain true that,
you know, things that they've probably
[SPEAKER_01]: been breeding for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That pure pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lucky last question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your biggest hope for the cannabis
scene in general?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, go back how it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, no, things are good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, as long as people aren't
going, getting thrown in jail for,
[SPEAKER_01]: for little amounts of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, uh, you're able, you know,
grow a few plants in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's not terrible at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sun keeps shining.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the end of it all, do you have any
shout outs or comments you'd like to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you having me, I guess,
uh, give a shout out to all those
[SPEAKER_01]: activists activists that got us to this
point and, uh, you know, to put in some
[SPEAKER_01]: jail time so we can have our freedom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I guess, I guess, uh,
everybody that's helped me along the way,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, CSI Fletcher, uh, with archive,
they've both been a huge help.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've always, uh, you know, if I,
if I lost strains, I can always count on
[SPEAKER_01]: them and, uh, you know, vice versa,
you know, when they need something,
[SPEAKER_01]: I always got their backs too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about it.
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure, I'm sure I'm, I'm sure I'm
forgetting a ton of folks, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, yeah, you know, just everybody that's
ever helped me along this journey,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, super appreciative, you know,
I can't thank everybody enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for coming on the show,
Shabbat and, uh, for dropping all the
[SPEAKER_02]: history and setting the record straight on
a few things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.

[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there we have it.
