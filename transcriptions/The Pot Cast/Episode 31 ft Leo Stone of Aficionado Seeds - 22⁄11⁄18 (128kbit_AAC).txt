[SPEAKER_04]: On this episode, we're joined by the one
and only Leo Stone of Aficionado Genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: to talk all things high-end brands,
top-shelf bud and strain history.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty, so a big hello and welcome to
the mastermind behind Aficionado Genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks so much, Leo Stone, for joining us
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_04]: So first question, what are you currently
smoking on?
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't named it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cross between cherry noir,
which was a collab that me and Gene and I
[SPEAKER_02]: did back in 2013.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave a mail from my pollen from my Chem
Dog Special Reserve mail and he put that
[SPEAKER_02]: on one of his cherry limes and that plant
ended up becoming the mother of one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: selections from those seeds and to become
the mother for the white cherry truffle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we took that mother and we put a
Testerosa mail on it to see where it would
[SPEAKER_02]: take it and it took it in an entirely
different direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been smoking on it for a week and
I've been talking to Professor Q,
[SPEAKER_02]: who's my partner, and he lives in France
right now and so I'm telling him,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's like, man, where the fuck are we
going to, we have a working title for it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's like, we don't know where we're
going to name it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's a new flavor we haven't,
we have yet to come across.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't want to give it some generic
ass name that's not going to give it some
[SPEAKER_02]: justice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, gosh, there's so many questions I
want to ask and I'm going to forget a
[SPEAKER_04]: bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the first one in the most kind of
recent thing you mentioned at the end
[SPEAKER_04]: there was the idea of giving relevant
names to strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always felt like this is an important
point.
[SPEAKER_04]: As someone made a point in the past where
they were like, oh, you go give some
[SPEAKER_04]: awesome name to a strain and then it turns
out to be a shitty strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think should be our
conventions around naming strains?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think people should put an effort
into trying to name it after something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like, I think it's the idea and
the identity of the strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you go beyond that and you go start
like, we're breeders and your job is to
[SPEAKER_02]: make strains connect with people and you
have to market those strains so you
[SPEAKER_02]: connect with people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we really approach it, it's a lot
like music to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the name of the album,
the name of the track has to fit the song.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in our case, as being breeders for
us, it's like the name really has to fit
[SPEAKER_02]: the strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it comes to naming, it's an
important aspect of distinguishing
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself as a breeder or a creator of
strains on what you name your strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be the world's first experience
and interface with your work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gonna hear the name, they're gonna
hear about it before they even smoke it,
[SPEAKER_02]: 99.9% of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, it's the true identity that
you're gonna give it for the long run.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a long term.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that a lot of thought,
a lot of really careful thought needs to
[SPEAKER_02]: go into what you're gonna name your
children, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, the same thing is said with what
we go naming a strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really a convention.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go into breeding a strain and people
will go, oh, let's call it this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll finish the strain at the end
and it just doesn't fucking identify with
[SPEAKER_02]: that name.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta call it something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's essence isn't exposed till you're
done making the strain and the final
[SPEAKER_02]: product, that's what you name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the consistency of your strains you're
breeding, this is something I'm super
[SPEAKER_02]: passionate about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it goes often overlooked because a
lot of breeders gotta understand that
[SPEAKER_02]: every single fucking strain is its own
brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about your company as the fucking
seed brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the umbrella.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the carrier, you're the worker bee.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant is allowing you to take its
pollen and make certain crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that more than anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it comes to naming these things
and giving these things a life and an
[SPEAKER_02]: identity, it's a huge fucking process for
us because that's the life of the cookies,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say someone took cookies and Jigga
got lazy and was like, oh, this is just F1
[SPEAKER_02]: derb cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it fucking taste?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you open the bag, does it smell like
a plate of fresh cookies?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck no.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it has its own identity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could open a bag and smell cookies and
that's fucking cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the label's right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so our goal as breeders is to
establish that, is to establish something
[SPEAKER_02]: that's easy to remember but also inspires
a sense of, the name is supposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: instantly inspire a sense of value or an
idea or a myth or is supposed to connect
[SPEAKER_02]: with a certain emotion.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we try to do when we use
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real weed head knows what cat piss is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real weed heads know what cat piss is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you ask people, hey, you wanna smoke
wedding cake, grape pie or cat piss,
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll probably pick the sweeter of the
strains unless they know what cat piss is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the branding is really important to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, on the money with that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a sentiment someone has echoed in the
past was that they were looking up some
[SPEAKER_04]: names because they wanted to name their
strain this name.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're looking to see if it's
taken and sure enough it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then so they think of next in line and
then sure enough that one's taken.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you ever fear that that day is gonna
come when there are really no names?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's happy fucking right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many strains we've been working
on and some of these strains take years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the times we'll make an F1,
the F1 will just so fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll do great in testing and that will
just release F1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we're trying to, whether we're
trying to take something and back cross it
[SPEAKER_02]: or we're trying to bring it to like F2,
three or four, depending on what we wanna
[SPEAKER_02]: release, because people want a certain
monocle of a variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I got high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost my fucking train of thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna be real with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the first time it's happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking about the names being
taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is my point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're having that this year where we're
looking up different strains that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: been making, things that we've made back
in like 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now those names are taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's really a race to, this seems
like there's this race for people to
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking put different strains together
just so they can claim a certain brand
[SPEAKER_02]: name on their strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't really have a beef with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just, it's just a phenomenon of the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't bitch about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something you can't control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all you could do is adjust how you're
gonna react and adjust how you're gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: approach strain branding.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we had the creme brulee, we were
pretty, for the longest time we were in
[SPEAKER_02]: Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're based out of Lake Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Mendocino's, same thing with Tahoe,
is it's really insulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is before Instagram was really
huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook definitely was a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Instagram kind of changed the
landscape and how people really interface
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and learn about different brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we called, we've been working on a
strain since 2012 called creme brulee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the year we dropped it, Bay Exclusives
also had a creme brulee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was kind of difficult for us,
but I felt the best way to approach that
[SPEAKER_02]: was just to be respectful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't trying to step on Bay Exclusives'
toes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, hey man, obviously great minds
think alike.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want you to know I'm not trying to
step on your toes with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other aspects, it really is who has
the biggest reach and what genetic is
[SPEAKER_02]: quality enough to have their version of
creme brulee or their version of rose,
[SPEAKER_02]: get a certain exposure where people will
recognize your version as the definitive
[SPEAKER_02]: creme brulee, say.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got lucky with the creme brulee because
Bay Exclusives' creme brulee was really
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we had really good traction with the
clone getting out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Kevin Drodri was definitely doing some
selections with Ziggy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they found some bangers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that really helped it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes to that, that's a really,
one, are we running out of strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: And two, what happens if you have a strain
that something already called something?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just really difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been working on the sangria for a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been working on that for the past
two years, two, three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, I believe it was, I think it
was either compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was either compound or I could
be wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those really fucking fire
breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: But someone else had a sangria.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like a release.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's kind of the tough decision
we have this year is like, are we going to
[SPEAKER_02]: drop the sangria?
[SPEAKER_02]: We already had considerable traction with
it in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just going to go ahead and drop
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the risk you play because you
could risk, as a breeder, you could risk
[SPEAKER_02]: pissing off other breeders, which is never
a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And causing a stir because people have an
extreme attachment to their work and
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely certain names.
[SPEAKER_02]: That name, if it's catchy enough,
it's going to take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really going to put legs on the
strain where the brand and the quality
[SPEAKER_02]: itself is what's going to establish,
what's going to create the platform for
[SPEAKER_02]: longevity for any particular cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of a difficult one because
I've noticed this year we definitely have
[SPEAKER_02]: in a hard time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we made a Merlot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We made a cherry Merlot and we made a
Merlot back in 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's another really good,
really fucking talented breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think his name is Casey out of Yerba
Buena in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I think that's Corazon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might have to erase that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might be getting people mixed up,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's definitely, I found out
someone bred them Merlot and I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just let them have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we won't even try to fight for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just find a different name.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hard to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: These days you have to get really creative
and more people are, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: now confectionary based strains are pretty
hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we get all credit Jigga for
being the first guy to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: confectionary strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he was definitely inspired me to
have, you know, to name my cookies cross
[SPEAKER_02]: creme brulee, you know, before there was a
lot of, you know, back in 2013,
[SPEAKER_02]: before there was a lot of this on the
market.
So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's interesting is I talked to a lot of
people and we often discuss how you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can draw a lot of strains,
their roots back to ChemDog and how
[SPEAKER_04]: quintessentially, you know, it's,
it's really involved in most everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: But how would you feel about the idea of
in say 10 years from now, that same
[SPEAKER_04]: analogy is being made with the cookie
crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I can almost see it happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see it happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the lines that see junkie JBZ
is working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's killing it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't know these guys
personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a vested interest in their
companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I'm doing my work,
I try to not focus on what other people,
[SPEAKER_02]: but as a fan, I like to follow other
people and see what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm a, I'm fucking generally a big
fan of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see JBZ is killing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of his stock is based on,
on different OG Kush phenotypes and
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely the cookies, you know,
his Cush mints, his wedding cake,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a lot of this, these are,
these are cookie derivatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, Jigga did something,
you know, pretty amazing and the cookies,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, likes to breed true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It likes to mix with things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're going to see that in 10
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, we're going to start
seeing maybe in 10 years, a lot of these
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses are going to come from cats like
compound or symbiotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's whatever's fire at the time,
but you know, something as definitive as
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many strains crossed with,
but what Jigga did with the cookies forced
[SPEAKER_02]: people to really look further into what
lions are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he had, he had a, they,
the cookie fam had a really good idea,
[SPEAKER_02]: had a really good feel for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For what was hot for the market at that
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a really good eye for selecting,
in my opinion, because when, when I,
[SPEAKER_02]: when I'm working cookies crosses and I'm
in breeding them and I'm out crossing
[SPEAKER_02]: them, I'm using different parents that,
that I'm assuming that they used,
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to see kind of, you know,
what goes into cookies and, and what's
[SPEAKER_02]: making, you know, all these strains so
fucking fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's in cookies that's making these
strains so fucking fire, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, I guess that brings us to the
million dollar question.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think's in cookies?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm not even touched that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I do know, um, what I do know is that
there's definitely, you know, we've,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a lot of Hindu, a lot of Hindu
tendencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you ever take Mendocino,
like Leightonville in particular,
[SPEAKER_02]: a Spiroc area, um, you know, Cato peak
area is a really good, um, example of how,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they've been holding,
you know, old Hindu Kush varieties since,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the early to late seventies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in these, you know, old Hindu Kush
varieties, which Tom Hill later bred into
[SPEAKER_02]: as the brief deep chunk, we still have
access to these seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of, we were seeing a lot of
similarities, a lot of parallels between
[SPEAKER_02]: how the cookies grows and behaves,
the frost profile, the noses and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and with, and with the, uh,
uh, the Hindus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I could, you could be wrong, but it's just
a general, it was just, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: based on years of observation and having
an established pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're not fucking scientists,
but we definitely know that observation is
[SPEAKER_02]: the cornerstone of evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as breeders and intuitive breeders,
cause we're all not scientists,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not fucking doctors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We basically use this observation so we
could see what's in a strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it came to cookies, it really made
me look, so the cookie fam has cookies and
[SPEAKER_02]: sherbert.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's the big debate about if
Skittles came from Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I, I grew cookies next to Skittles
next to the cherry pie next to Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew it next to Royal Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew it and I grew it all next to an old
school Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me that Urkel was the most common
denominator I found between a lot of those
[SPEAKER_02]: strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of these really exciting
flavors, um, that Mandelbrot got out of,
[SPEAKER_02]: out of his Royal Kush lines that was,
was the fucking, I thought it was the sour
[SPEAKER_02]: for years until I took all these cultivars
and I grew them next to the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could see a striking similarity
between all these cultivars, not so much
[SPEAKER_02]: in the cookies, but more in the,
in, in definitely in the Skittles and in
[SPEAKER_02]: the sherbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I saw a lot of, uh, telltale signs of
Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these really exciting flavors,
you know, um, uh, you know, Urkel and OG
[SPEAKER_02]: are really the fathers of a lot of these
really exciting fruit flavors that have
[SPEAKER_02]: like these really strong, grapey,
you know, almost vineyard kind of floral
[SPEAKER_02]: bouquets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wish I had my fucking breeding notes
with me because it's really interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: where you're getting at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I try to look at what's making
everything so hot in the fucking market
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the most common denominator?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, certain, you know, populations
of strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say populations, I'm telling like
populations of OG populations of,
[SPEAKER_02]: of things that are crossed either with GDP
or Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you wouldn't have GDP without the
fucking Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Urkel is like one of the original,
you know, purple that that was the
[SPEAKER_02]: original purple strain that had this
fucking incredible, crazy flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and so I've noticed that going back
to the Urkel, you know, the Urkels where
[SPEAKER_02]: you wouldn't have cherry pie without the
Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there, there was so many
similarities between cherry pie Urkel that
[SPEAKER_02]: was, that was unreal to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, same thing with the Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Skittles actually, you know,
I don't think it's directly a descendant
[SPEAKER_02]: of Urkel, but you could definitely see,
I'm still trying to fucking figure out
[SPEAKER_02]: what's in Skittles, but you grow it next
to an Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't, you can't help it, but to see
the similarities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's all we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just trying to guess and see where
straight, where, where flavors are coming
[SPEAKER_02]: from.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, you know, some is definitive as
cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, you know, I think that's going to
be something that, you know, like every,
[SPEAKER_02]: like now all these strains came from sour
or chem dog or OG five to 10 years,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's still going to be strains coming
from gelato, cookies and sherbert.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's they're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I guess one of the questions I
wanted to ask quickly, do you trust the
[SPEAKER_04]: Fireloss results on Skittles?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, honestly, I, I'm going to be
real since we're on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Fireloss results were, was what,
was what made the Fireloss results was
[SPEAKER_02]: provided at the time it provided the
evidence where I was like, obviously,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the owners of this, whoever
created this strain, it's, it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: muddied and it's really foggy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what Fireloss is was you can't argue
with genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fucking science, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, also at the same time,
you know, the whole genome hasn't been
[SPEAKER_02]: sequenced too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the thing with Fireloss too,
it's, it's at the discretion of who,
[SPEAKER_02]: who, who, who, you know, it's,
there's a lot of human error involved
[SPEAKER_02]: where I work with a lot of breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work with a lot of fucking nurseries and
anybody, a lot of people are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: identify with this where they get a
fucking tray of clones and some clones are
[SPEAKER_02]: mislabeled or you get plants from people
and some plants are mislabeled.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that could be a possibility
where something was mislabeled and that
[SPEAKER_02]: happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just based on that one
Skittles test.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't gone back to the galaxy and
explored more because as a geneticist,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's hard for me to reconcile,
uh, being, it's, it's hard for me to
[SPEAKER_02]: reconcile the reality of a lot of people
submitting their, their genetic data to
[SPEAKER_02]: Fireloss and all this data is siloed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're seeing this in genomics
companies like 23andMe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing this for the new genomics
blockchain company called Nebula where,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you have, you know, these
genomics companies where data donors,
[SPEAKER_02]: and in this case, breeders and growers
donate their DNA and, and that they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: sequence it for a fee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the same time, that data for a
regular human genomics company that data
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to be bought by a data buyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's why these business models
are so fucking successful is because data,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, data buyers, that's a huge
business data acquisition for,
[SPEAKER_02]: for, for research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially when it comes to human
genomics is, is for, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: personalized medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we see where the, where the
industry is going with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: are we going to make personalized strains
for people's individual cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: systems?
[SPEAKER_02]: How, you know, what's the evolution of
genomics?
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes to someone like Fireloss,
you know, I think it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of respect for, for what they
did.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just to me as a breeder, I think there
needs to be a platform where all the data
[SPEAKER_02]: is definitely decentralized and it's still
owned outright by the data donors and the
[SPEAKER_02]: data donors have a right to say,
you know, what you can and can't do with
[SPEAKER_02]: that data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's, you know,
definitely how I feel about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I went down a little rabbit
hole right there, but that's, that's
[SPEAKER_04]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think what they're,
what they're there, they were the first
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis genomics company, you know,
so I've, you know, I have a lot of respect
[SPEAKER_02]: for that, but there is, there is a huge
possibility for all this data to be
[SPEAKER_02]: abused.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is, when you have siloed data,
you, the data is in one particular place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a fuck how much security you
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hackable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is why blockchain's huge
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because you have things on thousands
of servers and so you can't hack thousands
[SPEAKER_02]: of servers, but you could fucking hack
one, you know, and I, and prior to me,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you know, doing cannabis full
time, you know, I was kicked out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: army for smoking weed, but while I was in
the army, I was, I was intelligence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these are things that when it comes
to data, you know, information's
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how all breeders protect your
fucking data.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is nobody knows how big the genetics
market is going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody knows how valuable that data is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is going to be, there's going to be
huge pharmaceutical cannabis companies
[SPEAKER_02]: that are, that I can't wait to buy all
this data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they could, you know, genetically
modify strains or they could, or they
[SPEAKER_02]: could, you know, do breeding, you know,
marker assisted breeding to, to find
[SPEAKER_02]: certain strains and to go and patent those
flavor profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just one scenario, you know,
so it's to me, when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders work in their, in their data,
you've got to protect that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we definitely got down a
rabbit hole because, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're the rootier question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was, you know, Philo sequencing,
you know, the Skittles and Philo's work,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I think that work was great,
but at the same time, there just needs to
[SPEAKER_02]: be a platform where all the breeders could
still control their data and who
[SPEAKER_02]: interfaces it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I love it, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's keep going down this rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next question is, you know,
you just touched on like big companies and
[SPEAKER_04]: like the legal side and the need for
security.
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: We, we see people trademarking things
within the industry, but we don't see
[SPEAKER_04]: cease and desist being commonplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: How long do you think it's going to take?
[SPEAKER_04]: It is until that does start to occur and
we see what you kind of predicted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's going to really depend on,
you know, my lawyer always tells me who's
[SPEAKER_02]: who else who has the most money for
litigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so whoever has, you know,
whatever company holds whatever said
[SPEAKER_02]: trademark, you know, if they have a big
enough war chest, it won't be a problem,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, sending cease and desist letters
and backing that up, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: legally backing that up and financially
backing that up, you know, so I definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: see this as.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's difficult because it's a lot of
people are worried about exactly what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're at, what you're talking about right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what if someone goes out and
trademarks her, our, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: our strain names or our brand and sends us
the cease and desist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think that when you're,
you know, mostly cease and desist is
[SPEAKER_02]: unless someone's stealing your brand,
you know, try a little harder to come up
[SPEAKER_02]: with something more unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, like we, we named the Testa
Rosa.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when Ferrari sends me a cease
and desist, it'll be, it'll be both a
[SPEAKER_02]: horrible and a great day because we've
reached that, that level of exposure where
[SPEAKER_02]: Ferrari, you know, so I think it's a good
thing, you know, like look at Gorilla
[SPEAKER_02]: Glue, you know, they got beat up by,
you know, by that company, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they could have called it GG four,
but at the same time, man, Josie Wales and
[SPEAKER_02]: the Gorilla Glue crew, you're fucking
your, your, your name in his, in pot
[SPEAKER_02]: history is etched in stone now,
you know, so you could, I think,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's always, you could,
in those instances, you could kind of turn
[SPEAKER_02]: shit into sugar, you know, and I think if,
you know, these trademark things are
[SPEAKER_02]: really difficult, you know, trademarking
different strain names.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you, you know, how do you,
you know, reinforce that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it first to file or the first to
invent?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what if someone invents
something and someone goes out and
[SPEAKER_02]: trademarks it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's, this is a really,
this is trying to navigate cannabis right
[SPEAKER_02]: now in regulation to me is like playing
three dimensional chess in a fucking dark
[SPEAKER_02]: room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're constantly figuring, you're feeling
your way things out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, you learn by making mistakes,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and you're really just feeling in,
in, in there's so many dimensions and
[SPEAKER_02]: facets to it that you're constantly having
to adjust fire and adapt to a new set of
[SPEAKER_02]: circumstances.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now you used to be able to call
your strains, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now if you're not careful,
sir, big companies will send you a cease
[SPEAKER_02]: and desist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Matt rise was one of the first people
to get a cease and desist.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had the, uh, shatter brothers and the
shadow brothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was coming out of Hopland back in
like, you know, 2011, 2012 rise was one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the first guys to popularize, you know,
ice wax abstraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was one of the, he was one of those
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he also had a shatter company and the
shatter company had this depiction of
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking Mario and Luigi making shatter it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Nintendo sent those guys a cease and
desist, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it was definitely,
you know, it could be a bad thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: but damn Matt, you know, your exposure was
to the point where you got the Nintendo's
[SPEAKER_02]: attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: This could be turned into a game by some
breeders, but I think it's a slippery
[SPEAKER_02]: slope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a dangerous one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we hear talks about big players
getting involved in the industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: even like, you know, kind of well-known
big players.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cringe to say that that Dan Bilzerian
guy has been in the news for a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about this type of move?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it's just like a fad thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you think overall it's a good or a
bad thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a bad thing to have rich people
getting involved in the industry?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I've kind of heard arguments on both
sides, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, here's how I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, you know, with people like
Dan Bilzerian, the guys, you could tell by
[SPEAKER_02]: that guy's fucking IG feed, he's
definitely a weed guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're into guns, partying,
that kind of lifestyle, you're definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking some fucking weed, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, I know a lot of these guys
that come from that same, that similar
[SPEAKER_02]: worlds as Dan's world and they're fucking
weed people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But that doesn't necessarily mean that you
understand the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is kind of like,
I'm not using Dan as an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a different example.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the fucking guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I just know him through his reputation
and he's getting, you know, busy
[SPEAKER_02]: investing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of these corporate guys that are
coming into the industry and they think
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's going to work out for them just
cause they're fucking rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminds me a lot of when Paris Hilton
tried becoming an EDM DJ, she got laughed
[SPEAKER_02]: off stage, laughed out of the fucking
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like, oh, that's cute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your money's going to be a panacea for
lack of talent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's, that's, you know,
how we feel about this is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have all these corporate cannabis guys
coming into the game and they don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: People forget this shit's like fucking
music.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel me?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, rappers, rappers are like the
growers in our industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, breeders are like the producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have to, and at the same thing
with it, with it being like music,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the trends in cannabis start at the
street level.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that was the magic of cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the magic of, you know,
you take anybody that's, that was big from
[SPEAKER_02]: the Emerald cup, you know, dying breed,
mean gene, those fucking guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all, they all got hell of hill and
street credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: You, you don't get to that level without
having that connection, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: with that street aspect, you know,
people forget it's like, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're growing medicine, but can we,
we all fucking acknowledge for a minute
[SPEAKER_02]: that California was the largest producer
of cannabis, the entire country growing
[SPEAKER_02]: the country's fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it all wasn't medicine guys,
you know, and so all that pushing the
[SPEAKER_02]: trends of what's pushed on the street and
what's in demand happens on the fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: street level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has to be co-signed on the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't be a famous rapper without being
co-signed by someone from the hood or
[SPEAKER_02]: being co-signed by some OG in the
industry, like P Diddy or J Prince,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, from rap a lot records who,
you know, who helped create shape and
[SPEAKER_02]: shift fucking hip hop as it is,
you know, right, right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like with corporate guys coming
in, I think it's, you know, I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's something to learn from them when
they have these really, really efficient
[SPEAKER_02]: business process, uh, business processes,
um, and really efficient ways for
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding markets in ways weed guys
can't, um, you know, understand the
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just because you have those talents
doesn't mean that you could connect with
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking smokers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we say it's like music,
you know, an artist entire fucking job is
[SPEAKER_02]: to connect with people around the world
is, is to put something, take something
[SPEAKER_02]: from nothing, put his heart into the
studio and connect with the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: The growers do the same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, breeder lays the track.
[SPEAKER_02]: He puts the strain into the growers hand
and the, and the growers going to express
[SPEAKER_02]: that strain in a different way than any
other grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when that weed leaves, when that
quality leaves, that usually goes to the
[SPEAKER_02]: street level or the quality is going to be
acknowledged at the street level.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't see any corporate cannabis guys
coming in and just killing the game right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, selling, you know, selling out
the top shelf and the street and everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: collectively agreeing saying that that
corporate cannabis company is putting out
[SPEAKER_02]: top shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't exist right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it's like, you could put all
the money you can, but still big Al
[SPEAKER_02]: exotics out of fucking Santa Rosa.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the first, they're the first
company right now with a hundred dollar
[SPEAKER_02]: eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, so all these guys are trying to
start these fucking brands and they all
[SPEAKER_02]: want to be luxury cannabis and put this
booth in these really nice packages.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you don't have fucking street
credit and you don't have, you don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: the fucking real DNA, the passion,
you're not willing to fucking sacrifice
[SPEAKER_02]: everything for your craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ain't going to make it because there's
guys out there who are sacrificing
[SPEAKER_02]: everything for their fucking craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when it's that good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what makes people remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the music.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what connects with people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what I was like as an
artist.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the cookie fam, you know,
a lot of people talk shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I respect the hustle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I came from fucking nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't grow up in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a transplant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came in Mendo with a broken Beamer with
Texas plates and a broken windshield.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was pulled over all the fucking time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to see people and so to interface
that street level and then see people like
[SPEAKER_02]: the cookie fam use that to their advantage
and create, you know, make history,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, connect with people in that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really follow that music while I connect
people that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's, that's how you're going to
reach success.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these corporate processes,
these guys are, these guys don't know what
[SPEAKER_02]: the fuck they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be quite honest with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them do, but really it's like,
you're making money right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, a lot of people in the game
right now, the real true believers like
[SPEAKER_02]: big Al and Frenchie, we're in this for the
rest of our fucking lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's who the corporate cannabis
guys got to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because you have a million dollars
and you like making shoes, doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're going to be Christian la
bouton tomorrow or, or you're going to be,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to be Manolo Blahnik
tomorrow just because you have fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: money.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is art.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what these are corporate guys
don't get.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a fucking commodity.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to play commodities,
grow your big ass outdoors in your
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses and turn that shit in the oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not our fucking market.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the breeders and the growers
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't shape.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't create shape and shift the
history of cannabis through putting booth
[SPEAKER_02]: on the fucking market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You create shape and shift the history of
cannabis by changing the flavor profiles
[SPEAKER_02]: and get everybody to a degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, uh, they don't seem to
understand that like trends and things are
[SPEAKER_04]: started by creative people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then people will like them more so
take over it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you touched on this perfect idea,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: With, with big Al, I had a question
perfectly lined up for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we've kind of seen in response to
that a hundred dollar eights of Mac that
[SPEAKER_04]: caps, you know, Capulator hasn't been too
happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And his argument was that he doesn't want
his brand associated with this type of
[SPEAKER_04]: what he would call price gouging.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your, what are your thoughts on
that?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, do you think a breeder gets to
have a say that extends that far out,
[SPEAKER_04]: so to speak?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, let me start from this level.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cap's probably one of the most
talented guys in the industry right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's creating shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's fucking creating, you know,
only guys coming close to cap right now is
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking in house and see junkie JBZ.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with like, you know, being a breeder,
I understand, I understand why he's upset.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand why he wouldn't want that
because he's the creator.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's his baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the flip side, I used to have
those, those reactions too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I, I realized that when you,
when you let something out on the market,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's going to take its own life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could either be a success or it could
be a failure, but as a breeder,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to accept either one of those
dichotomies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up, you have to, because you control
is a fucking illusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what breeding taught me is that
control is illusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't control shit, especially when
you send stuff down range, you send things
[SPEAKER_02]: down the pipeline, seeds, clones,
they're going to take a life of their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so, you know, with cap being
upset, I just had a hard time
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding why he would, why he,
what, why he wasn't so receptive to that
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of exposure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, he's really one of
those true believers, like one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: really down to earth dudes that that's not
in the flash and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's really about the craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, I genuinely see where he's coming
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I respect this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but I also have another side of me
where I've always dreamed of there being a
[SPEAKER_02]: luxury cannabis component for people to
participate in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that was why we started to
fishing out of that way back in 2012 is I
[SPEAKER_02]: was like, fuck, if Mendocino and Humboldt
can, can, can establish Appalachian a form
[SPEAKER_02]: of prestige, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that you see in wine, then that would
stabilize the long-term price of,
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so on that same note, like,
like if you use Bordeaux as a model where
[SPEAKER_02]: they, where they created the Bordeaux
Appalachian in the mid 1800s, and they got
[SPEAKER_02]: a premium on their wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was then up to the participating brands
in Bordeaux to make Bordeaux Bordeaux,
[SPEAKER_02]: to make it what it is today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the goal was to make
aficionado this, this, this, this
[SPEAKER_02]: apparatus that allowed us to, to
participate in high-end cannabis when the
[SPEAKER_02]: day came, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like big Al was the first to
do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the first to sell a hundred,
a hundred dollar eight and everything
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't binary.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my, that's my thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I'm not mad at anyone per se,
but this ain't fucking binary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because it's a hundred dollar eight
doesn't mean all samples of Max are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be go for a hundred dollars,
you know, but, but we can't ignore that
[SPEAKER_02]: price demographic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people who are students
economics, the luxury industry is the only
[SPEAKER_02]: industry that can fucking continues to
grow despite recessions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like, you know, if you're a
small guy, you don't have a huge fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: corporate war chest, but what you do is
you have fucking talent and you have
[SPEAKER_02]: quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, where are these Christian lobotons
going to come from in our industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the John Paul Gaultier's?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the real Louis Vuitton's?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is, this is what's fucking
possible right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I'm telling people like,
stop, you know, don't, don't necessarily,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, resist this new fuck of
phenomena.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a great thing for small people,
because small people are the only people
[SPEAKER_02]: who have the prestige, the heritage and
the roots to be considered a luxury brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause if money and nice branding
considered you a luxury brand,
[SPEAKER_02]: then Candescent be a fucking luxury brand,
but they're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, you know, when you have,
you know, what are the prerequisites for
[SPEAKER_02]: luxury brands?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a unique know-how in a
particular area of expertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your work has to have, an incredible
attention to detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to use different ingredients and
techniques than other people use.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of almost like food too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what separates a thousand
dollars, you know, $300 steak from a $30
[SPEAKER_02]: steak, you know, ingredients, technique
and timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and also the prestige of the chef
preparing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you need all these things to,
to, to justify yourself as, as being raw
[SPEAKER_02]: enough to command those fucking prices.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, who knows the longevity?
[SPEAKER_02]: The longevity of the a hundred dollar
eighth, but it's a fucking phenomenon
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's amazing that someone from our
community was able to establish that was
[SPEAKER_02]: able to break that boundary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone from our neighborhood broke that
boundary and not corporate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, why can't we just realize that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I bet you, if it was some corporate
cannabis guys, everybody would be up in
[SPEAKER_02]: arms.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, corporate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew this would happen, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the pendulum swings the other
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: The small guy with 40 fucking lights
selling a hundred dollar eights to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Migos, they opened that strain up to a
wider, more diverse audience just because
[SPEAKER_02]: of price point alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: The laws of economics did take that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an entire demographic,
a clientele and customer that only
[SPEAKER_02]: discerns value based on the perceived
price.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they don't know any better,
then how did they know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, price is one indicator where it's
like, okay, it's obviously has some extra
[SPEAKER_02]: level of prestige, but it better fucking,
it better be good, which is the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's arguments whether,
you know, was it worth a hundred dollars
[SPEAKER_02]: and eight?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, fucking millionaires like Migos
definitely fucking felt that it was worth
[SPEAKER_02]: a hundred dollars and eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the trend that needs to
happen is that when you have these
[SPEAKER_02]: different brands, we're able to interface
and open new opportunities for small guys
[SPEAKER_02]: that are, that got the fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big guys don't got the fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the small guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a great, this is a great time
for small people, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, I was happy as fuck,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I called Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, dude, this is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was getting roasted, but it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he, he's killing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every, every, if you're angry,
you anger can exist without fear.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a fear based emotion.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you angry, it's like, what are you
scared of?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is what I want to ask a lot of these
people, not necessarily cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not talking to cap in this particular
context.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I, I hunnidly wholeheartedly see
where crap's coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he's a creator, but with other
people, like other people that are really
[SPEAKER_02]: chiming on, on, on, on the subject,
it's like, man, why can't you just be
[SPEAKER_02]: happy for him?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that, yeah, that's, that's
capulator's beef, but something was done
[SPEAKER_02]: in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to help the small guy more
than anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is a huge, it's going to be
a huge economic force for, for,
[SPEAKER_02]: for guys that are at the top of their game
that got the shit together and know how to
[SPEAKER_02]: communicate and sell their strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now a big, I was able to do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caps going to be able to do that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't want to count.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wasn't going to gouge people,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a lot of these growers are
going to come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to see crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be a price war,
but there needs to also be a spectrum of
[SPEAKER_02]: brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just can't be affordable cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just can't be affordable wine and
affordable alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people gave me shit about my
prices for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like, deal with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I only make certain, you know,
so many strains per year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fuck a sift through a lot of strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is like, you know,
only recently a couple hundred boxes of
[SPEAKER_02]: each straight anyway.
So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so, but it's like, it's really
in the eye of the holder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've spoken to a lot of people who
have these opinions and what I find to be
[SPEAKER_04]: the most interesting part of it all is
that these same people aspire to have,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, luxury cars.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, they're okay with luxury,
something else, but not in our industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, you know, essentially
we're, you know, there are your people who
[SPEAKER_02]: like to ball out in our industry,
but you know, the cool thing about the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, which is, you know, one of the
positives that we do have a lot of humble
[SPEAKER_02]: people, a lot of humble people that,
that, that don't need the flash that don't
[SPEAKER_02]: need to, you know, when Swerve was blowing
up back in the day, posting pictures of
[SPEAKER_02]: his Jaguar motherfucker was getting hated
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not necessarily our culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, if you're flossing and you're
in the weed game and you were putting that
[SPEAKER_02]: on Instagram, you were wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're basically dry snitching on
yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's so, you know, but I like
the fact that the community has this sense
[SPEAKER_02]: of humbleness to them because humbleness
is in, in, in lacking ego is what's needed
[SPEAKER_02]: to, to create true craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think once you create that craft,
there needs to be a mechanism to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to open that craft to what's the highest
potential this, you know, our market has
[SPEAKER_02]: as boutique craftsman.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, we can't do, we can't get in a
fucking price war with corporate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for damn sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely this huge under served
demographic of, of, of, of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: of, you know, upscale oriented customers
that want to indulge in this level of weed
[SPEAKER_02]: and it fucking exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cats like big out cats like
fucking, you know, capulator and fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys are growing the fire like crazy
fire, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, but I think that we are,
they also, everybody collectively deserves
[SPEAKER_02]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that you spent time in the game
and, and you really cut your teeth and you
[SPEAKER_02]: sacrificed everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's a great fucking moment
when, when the market could acknowledge
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, your, your stuff is worth,
you know, you know, X amount, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think you could love her to hate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you could sit in front of a
Rolex shop, you know, with a time X on
[SPEAKER_02]: your risk and fucking bitch about life all
day saying, Oh, I might watch tell us I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys are ripping people off,
but that's just like, that's just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys got to shift your focus,
your awareness from that particular
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective and broaden your horizons.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, Oh, what are the opportunities
in this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause if big out could do it, how many
other people could do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, we don't know what the
longevity of these price points are like
[SPEAKER_02]: first off, but, but we do know that the
luxury, you know, luxury clientele
[SPEAKER_02]: demographic continues to grow worldwide,
you know, that that's a fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we definitely know that in
cannabis is quickly becoming a
[SPEAKER_02]: international Canada has already taken
international us is we're really behind
[SPEAKER_02]: right now on that, you know, cause we can
have a serious edge, but when it does go
[SPEAKER_02]: international, man, when it does go
international, we have to be cognizant of
[SPEAKER_02]: this entire spectrum of customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who do you want to sell to?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to be Jack Daniels,
that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to be ever clear, you want to
be Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need these people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need those price points in the
ecosystem to differentiate ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, fucking Chateau Montrachet at
$30,000 a bottle needs box wine to create
[SPEAKER_02]: that fucking huge chasm of separation that
reminds people, this is why you're paying
[SPEAKER_02]: X amount for this bottle of wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I want to see that in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always been my dream to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've tried doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've been doing that with,
you know, we got really lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been doing that with seeds,
you know, for the last seven years,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, when it came to flowers,
anybody could smoke a flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only a few people can grow seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you have to really know,
you know, kind of what a fish you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was working with or know us from back in
the day to kind of really understand our
[SPEAKER_02]: value.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we don't think that,
you know, we're big players in the
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics game.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just really, really passionate about
what we do, but only so many people could
[SPEAKER_02]: grow seeds, but anybody, anybody could
smoke a flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody could smoke hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Frenchies power is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck smokes out thousands of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every month.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody knows what Frenchie is,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the same thing is with,
with, with, with fire ass growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody could experience that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like, if anybody could
experience that, what place in the market
[SPEAKER_02]: do you choose or wish to participate in?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, why live it yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're worth that, you know,
really like is, is being aware better than
[SPEAKER_02]: being humble, you know, or is being humble
better than being aware, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: which, which, which of these paths are we
going to change?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to choose as, as breeders,
growers and marketers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't, we have all sorts of the seeds,
like just because you're creating a craft,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's up to you to fucking now communicate
this and market it to the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's value.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it's like, it's, it's all,
everybody has choices and big Al made a
[SPEAKER_02]: choice and it was a great choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just think it was really,
it was, I thought it was just really
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunate that, you know, the tension
between, you know, big Al and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and cap is there, you know, cause you
know, the two guys are, are, are genuinely
[SPEAKER_02]: good people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I never met cap, but my partner,
Leo, you know, knows him and he says,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody I know that knows caps is great
thinking about him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with big Al.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like the most humble chill fucking
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just loves weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like, I think, you know,
it's unfortunate, but there's also a
[SPEAKER_02]: really cool potential for, for,
for people to come back, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: to come back full circle and, you know,
maybe collaborate, you know, someday down
[SPEAKER_02]: the future, you know, because that's
powerful what happened, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether you like it or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have sent a limo full of fucking
women to big Al's house.
[SPEAKER_02]: If he did that with my strength,
that's just me personally, just to start
[SPEAKER_02]: the thank you process.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we need that edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small time guys, boutique cultivators need
a distinct edge over corporate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what's happening right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like these guys are breaking
down fucking doors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So other boutique cultivators can
participate in these markets, interface
[SPEAKER_02]: these higher levels of society because a
lot of people fucking forget, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though a lot of trends happen at the
street level, trends also pair happened
[SPEAKER_02]: parallel at these really high end levels
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's also, there's also very
rich trend centers too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can't ignore it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you're really in the weed and
you, and your job is to get your strain
[SPEAKER_02]: and you really want your strain to connect
with people, not through hyper bullshit,
[SPEAKER_02]: but literally to be shared and connected
with people because your work is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something magical, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we might jump out of this
rabbit hole for a moment and go down a
[SPEAKER_04]: different one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to, just wanted to loop back
onto a point you made almost at the start
[SPEAKER_04]: of the interview, you mentioned the creme
brulee.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had a bit of luck in that the clone
got out there and it brought up this
[SPEAKER_04]: really interesting point of what is it
like to have a clone of yours?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a really nice one that's been
found, selected, and it gets out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a good or a bad thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause on the one hand it's like,
you know, obviously there's good sides to
[SPEAKER_04]: it, but at the other hand it's like,
well, if people can get access to the
[SPEAKER_04]: clone, they're probably not going to buy
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how do you feel about it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it good or is it bad?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoever's logic that was wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like look at all the cookie cross
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if cookie clone was on the
market, you know, you wouldn't have,
[SPEAKER_02]: you wouldn't have that, the success of
those crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's, I think it's, it's hugely,
I used to hoard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is me talking from, from my own
experience and somewhat regret that some
[SPEAKER_02]: of my best work I did it put into the
market, you know, you know, and that was
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of one of the things I learned
working with Kevin Jodry back in the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, who had one of the biggest
nurseries at the time at homeboat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, in order for your shit to
be on the market, you literally like in
[SPEAKER_02]: order to be hot in the market,
you have to have thousands of growers
[SPEAKER_02]: growing this shit and you have to have
thousands of pounds, tens of thousands,
[SPEAKER_02]: hundreds of thousands of pounds of your
strain touching people's hands across the
[SPEAKER_02]: country, across the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so that doesn't happen unless
you let the clone out, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so whatever you lose ownership,
you know, there's this, there's this false
[SPEAKER_02]: assumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are going to argue with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a false assumption that,
Oh, if I'm like the only one with this
[SPEAKER_02]: cut, I'm going to hoard it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to, it's you, you limit its
growth if you don't let it out because
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, you could show the world that you're
the best at growing, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: any particular, you know, this particular
strain, but growers and breeders,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're all competitive people, like by
nature, like that's why we, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we compete with ourselves to get better
with ourselves, why people get better,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we love showing our shit to each
other.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people love to say, Oh,
that was your cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at my cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and that's part of, that's part
of the culture too.
[SPEAKER_02]: What helps the strain get out there is
when it's a joy to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also, it's also, it doubles as,
it doubles as, you know, an opportunity
[SPEAKER_02]: for you to be able to, to express,
you know, what your best possible effort
[SPEAKER_02]: is, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think if you have a fire strain,
you gotta let, you gotta let it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The market's gotta test it, you know,
cause really the market, you could say
[SPEAKER_02]: it's fire all day long, but if people
ain't cloning it and pounds, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds aren't flowing in the clubs,
cause people could clone it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could have a million clones out there,
but if the clubs or the, or the streets
[SPEAKER_02]: ain't buying that weed again, they'll buy
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when Barry White came out as
the frostiest strain that hit Mendocino in
[SPEAKER_02]: a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at one year, everybody grew it and
everybody bought it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one time, you know, so it's like,
you get repeat buyers, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like people say, Oh, cookies is hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not fucking hype, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Millions of people are still buying it and
they come back and they buy it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's real.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: To have that, you gotta put your strain
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta put the clone out there,
which, you know, I fell, I fell short on,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the past, you know, five,
five years, you know, but I learned from,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I had to learn from my mistakes
to go, okay, really the right way is to
[SPEAKER_02]: let it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, will you lose ownership of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you really want to test your work
against the market and see how hot you are
[SPEAKER_02]: as a breeder, you got to put that shit out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So take us back.
[SPEAKER_04]: When did aficionado start in your mind?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like 2011.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what was the first project?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it kind of grew out of,
you know, I always had my, I was,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I started growing when I was in
Germany and I went to Amsterdam a lot,
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked a lot of weed, smoked a lot of
hash, always brought seeds back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought it was cool that,
you know, I could collect these seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I started hanging out with some
German college students that were growing
[SPEAKER_02]: organic indoor and they were breeding,
like they were crossing their super silver
[SPEAKER_02]: haze to like, you know, straight up land
races, like Afghanis and old school,
[SPEAKER_02]: like not, not even land race, but old
school, like black dominance, like shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't see, you know, anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that was really my crash
course into, you know, the next level of
[SPEAKER_02]: growing, you know, and he, this dude was
just having fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wasn't like a serious breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, uh, I hate buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just make my own seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't have to buy seeds and it turns
out good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought that was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so, um, after I, you know,
got out of the army in Germany,
[SPEAKER_02]: I, uh, you know, brought my seed
collection back to the States and,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, met with, you know,
the guy who became my mentor, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mendocino Mike, then he took me up,
he took me up, but, you know, that
[SPEAKER_02]: aficionado kind of, you know, was created
out of, you know, when I was growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're growing the best possible
cannabis, it just comes logical that you
[SPEAKER_02]: have to breed your own strains,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether you have a strain in clone
form, you know, it's going to come to the
[SPEAKER_02]: time where you have to start breeding your
own strains to have a unique edge over the
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you get to the point where you can
read the market and, and, and see what
[SPEAKER_02]: people want, you know, that's when I
really started taking breeding seriously
[SPEAKER_02]: was when I was in Mendo with Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, uh, I started on my own,
then I got my own scene and I did what
[SPEAKER_02]: every other grower does to make ends meet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta, you gotta do business,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got, you gotta help your friends out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta make sure that, that,
that the right things flow through the
[SPEAKER_02]: right pipelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the cool thing about that is you,
I was able to read the market in a way
[SPEAKER_02]: where I was like, okay, I think people
want this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'd make a cross, now test it out
and I grow it out and the buyers would
[SPEAKER_02]: like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it came to the time where buyers
were coming and they wanted just all
[SPEAKER_02]: sours.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted all chem dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want all sours, but they were buying
chem dog too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was like the headliners before,
you know, OG, you know, really hit the
[SPEAKER_02]: market and crazy bulk, um, up in Humboldt
Mendo is like chems and sours were like
[SPEAKER_02]: the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these repeat guys that were coming
back and making sure that things were
[SPEAKER_02]: flowing, they wanted, uh, they was like,
look, man, if you could hook our farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: up with, with, with a strain that smells
like this consistently, then we'll,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll buy the whole crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was really, I was like,
holy fuck, I could probably, I could like,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I've seen so much product flow,
you know, in Mendis, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in Humboldt, I had a good idea for like,
you know, who the best growers were,
[SPEAKER_02]: what the hottest genetics were.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew that even if the, the, the buyers
weren't coming into town, that even if,
[SPEAKER_02]: even if this wasn't what they were looking
for, all I had to do is open the fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I, all I, I found out early that
all you gotta do is exceed expectations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we created a chem dog strain and gave
it to our friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grew it, the buyers bought it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, that was, we exceeded the
expectations of that chem dog and we ended
[SPEAKER_02]: up entering that, that next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, when it came to
aficionado, it was kind of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, let's start a seed company.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was really inspired to start
the seed company from Shiloh massive
[SPEAKER_02]: before he started dying breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, he had this project called
massive seeds that he was doing like way
[SPEAKER_02]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that was like, you know,
that was really my first interface into
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, the seed breeders world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause all the breeders I knew,
like the seed breeders world that was like
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis industry, all the breeders I
was getting my seeds from in Mendo,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if it wasn't from Europe or just
like these old, these old growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and so I was paying through the
ass for OG seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's why we came up with our
particular price point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was buying $50 a seed,
OG seeds back in 2010, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 2000, you know, 2011, like that was a real
thing for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it was worth the investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it wouldn't have been
without those strains being in Mendo with
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike that aficionado just ended up
starting to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it w it just came as a natural
process of, I was definitely influenced by
[SPEAKER_02]: Shiloh, but I was able to take the strains
that I had, I collected, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I made with Mike and I had myself as an,
as a, as a way to, you know, communicate,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what if we could be,
you know, one of the best players in
[SPEAKER_02]: Mendocino?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how could we communicate that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, we ended up winning
the cup, our first cup in 2012.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that kind of really, you know,
really helped, you know, launch us into
[SPEAKER_02]: orbit with, with people, you know,
knowing who we were more buyers came up to
[SPEAKER_02]: us, you know, more people that wanted,
you know, a certain flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were really good with gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got really lucky with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, my OG was really good at,
you know, selecting things for gas,
[SPEAKER_02]: crossing things for gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, my later friend,
you know, Alan Atkinson, who, who founded
[SPEAKER_02]: Probiotic Farmer's Alliance and Grokashi,
he was really good at selecting for gas
[SPEAKER_02]: and selecting for good flavor too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, learning from all these
people having that, you know, that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, opportunity to, you know,
to meet Shiloh through Alan and to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to, to get my first glimpse out,
you know, what really the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry was like the above ground
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a different world for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was completely off grid and black and
white.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, for a long time, you know,
I was kicked out of the army.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I was kicked out of the army,
it was like, fuck, it's either sink or
[SPEAKER_02]: swim.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely ain't getting a job.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to make it work, you know,
so, you know, transitioning from straight,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the underworld to seeing this
kind of medical, quasi medical,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, cannabis movement happened in
Cali was, was just fucking mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was like, it was a different
world for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really, you know, what Fishing
Outta was born out of.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at what point did you decide to bring
Frenchie on board?
[SPEAKER_04]: And more importantly, it was kind of like
a bit of a forethinking thought on your
[SPEAKER_04]: part.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it about Frenchie that you
thought like, this is going to bring
[SPEAKER_04]: something new, a twist to the usual?
[SPEAKER_02]: He met, I met him after I got off the
stage at Emerald Cup in 2012.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I remember he came up to me and he
gave me this big hug.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't even know me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was just like really happy that he
was like, cause a lot of people when they
[SPEAKER_02]: win the cup, you know, they, they
basically pull their dick out and they
[SPEAKER_02]: flex, you know, and I never thought I
would, was going to win.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, if I get top 20, I'm at least
part of the cool kid crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to be acknowledged as a
grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted like my whole, you know,
it wasn't like I bred so I could keep
[SPEAKER_02]: growing fire for myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I could keep hitting the highest
ticket possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I met Frenchie man, he was just
really happy that when I won, I thanked my
[SPEAKER_02]: soil guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thank Jim Rogoff for making me some of
the dankest compost in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just, you know, super humbled,
you know, just to, you know, to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to be lucky enough to, you know,
to be able to express a plant to that
[SPEAKER_02]: level, you know, where we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when Frenchie, you know,
when I met Frenchie, it was just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like this instant connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, when you meet somebody,
you swear you've seen him before,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, you never seen him before,
but you have a feeling you've known him
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the thing, you know,
I see this guy, you get that feeling,
[SPEAKER_02]: then he opens a jar of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never smelled hash this fucking loud,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like it was some MK Ultra from
some growers down in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, dude, I've never smelled
hash like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, if your fucking hash doesn't
smell as loud or louder than your flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you fucked it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, dude, we got to do,
and it was right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like really that five minute span,
I was like, dude, you're my hash guy like
[SPEAKER_02]: forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been loyal to each other ever
since, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've never taken other people's
opportunities to make hash with them or
[SPEAKER_02]: have other people make hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, you know, Frenchie is one of
those day ones, man, where it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you have a special connection
and it was like, it just ended up,
[SPEAKER_02]: it wasn't planned.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ended up just being really compatible
and we ended up sharing the same vision.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he's French and he was a bag
designer back in the day and he has a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain idea for aesthetics and for
refinement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I always aspired to have
those sensibilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I kind of grew up in,
you know, my family wasn't rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they were middle-class,
but you know, I had to earn and work for
[SPEAKER_02]: everything I had as a child.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, nothing was given to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've always appreciated people that had
that sense of aesthetic that Frenchie has,
[SPEAKER_02]: that sense of refinement that we all wish
we could pursue at a higher level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, Frenchie was the biggest
blessing, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the, he's been the most solid guy
in my life for the past seven years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he's family, you know, so I'm really
lucky that, you know, we share the same
[SPEAKER_02]: vision on a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, when it comes to organic
growing, it comes to where the,
[SPEAKER_02]: where the company should go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Frenchie's definitely,
you know, he's, he's the fucking dude
[SPEAKER_02]: where I'm like, if I make a big move,
I run it by Frenchie first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Frenchie, what do you think about
this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what it's like to, to have a guy
like that that's solid, it's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess kind of leading into the next
question, the previous idea of like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you guys are expanding beyond the typical
breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that people would commonly
identify cookies as doing this,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, expanding into like a lifestyle
type of brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel like this is the natural
progression for all breeders or?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the fuck not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some breeders are going to choose to
participate at that level and some don't,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so some won't want to,
and that's up to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, I think it's cool,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like why not, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: If your shit's that hot and people want to
support you and hop and hop on your train,
[SPEAKER_02]: then man, that's a, that's, that's a cool
thing, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I respect people's hustle.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people like to hate on people's
hustle, but a lot of people forget that
[SPEAKER_02]: these are just ideas one day, you know,
and they, and they, and they fruited now
[SPEAKER_02]: they're now it's fruited into a huge
fucking brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: That took a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like, if a breeder is willing
to do that and do all that, work man,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, I fucking salute you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have my own plans for how I
want to express my merchandise,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, later in the future,
but you know, it was just to me,
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to really, you know, I really
want to focus on that craft and not go,
[SPEAKER_02]: all right, you know, because once you
start, you know, I'm a control freak.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I, if I did that, I'd have to
control the, you know, the, the
[SPEAKER_02]: merchandising and the branding of it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me is just as a breeder,
I wanted to focus on that craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when the time comes, um, for me to
branch out, then, you know, hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll be the right time and I'll execute
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think breeders, I think it's great,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn it into a huge lifestyle break.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it is a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: People hate on everything, but this is
like the cannabis lifestyle is fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a lifestyle that when you're in
it, you never want to leave it and
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody dreams of being in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I don't understand why
people, you know, could hate on these
[SPEAKER_02]: brands, you know, like, you know,
jungle boys gets a lot of flack,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and we can, and a lot of people,
around the globe could talk a lot of shit
[SPEAKER_02]: about jungle boys, but why is,
why are they the only one making that
[SPEAKER_02]: hustle work the way they're working it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like that there's magic in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel me?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like their whole concept approach to
branding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know these guys, Frenchy knows
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's really cool with them, but I just
respect hustles in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause all this shit came from fucking
nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're able to connect with people in
this manner where they want to wear your
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking clothes and support you and
communicate to the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: That these are the motherfuckers I
support, whether you agree with it or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like music.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody listens to future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody listens to these new
rappers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people would choose to listen to
older rappers like Biggie and Tupac,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's at your discretion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that doesn't negate the fact that
these clientele are there and people want
[SPEAKER_02]: to fucking support these motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_02]: People want to get behind certain brands
and be like, this is, this is my identity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a weed person and I identify with this
spectrum in the weed community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I think there should be more brands
that come out and flex and try to do a
[SPEAKER_02]: lifestyle brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you're raw and it's real,
they'll catch on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is, what's the saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Real, real, disease real or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real like, yeah, that was like a,
I didn't learn that one until I came in
[SPEAKER_02]: the industry either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like the above ground industry,
like this whole real, recognized real
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I didn't have that when I was
hustling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, were you on time and was the
money right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like not real, recognize real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this motherfucker does what he says.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like the whole real record.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's like, it's subjective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's real.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's, I mean, to me, to me, what's real
is like, you know, I look at it as
[SPEAKER_02]: authenticity in the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, at least sacrificed it and you
really, you were really, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you knew you were really in the culture,
you know, working for you, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: working to better your craft and really
going to the shows, connecting with
[SPEAKER_02]: people, you know, that's the real work.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the real hustle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's, there's definitely
tidbits of truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can draw from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the idea of are you doing what's good
for you or what's good for you as well as
[SPEAKER_04]: good for the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's an interesting one,
but yeah, that's like fucking is a good
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, do you want to do
what's good for the community or do you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to break boundaries?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, if you want to do what's
good for community, if you wanted to sell
[SPEAKER_02]: the a hundred dollar eight, but if you
want to break boundaries and make history,
[SPEAKER_02]: you sell a hundred dollar eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the kind of person I'd rather make
history.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, you know, a lot of people in
the community were against the high prices
[SPEAKER_02]: of aficionado back in the day,
but we wanted to make a point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't because we, you know,
we thought we were the best breeders,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, cause you know, I was working
with me and Gene back then and Don and Q
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was about showing the fucking very
best that Emerald triangle had to offer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's like, you know,
how do you want to communicate to the
[SPEAKER_02]: world what you do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that brings us to the next question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say the pricing of seeds is
an interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the past, you guys have copped a
bit of flack for the seed pricing.
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you generally answer someone who
was say critical of a more expensive
[SPEAKER_04]: pricing model in general?
[SPEAKER_02]: It better be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It better be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only reason why it works,
you know, in some, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: let me, let me say this straight up for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're playing genetics, it's,
it's, it's a, it's a game of statistics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a matter of time before you
release something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a, there's going to be some
seeds and a fire ass batch of seeds that
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't going to work out for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you're going to compete at a
certain price point, um, your testing
[SPEAKER_02]: better be on point, your selection better
be on point, or you're going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking roasted.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have incredibly high
standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think like, depending on how you
choose to price your seeds, that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: hardest part.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this worth?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because you say it's worth something
doesn't mean people are going to buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the hard part about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, you know,
we got lucky, you know, we tend to sell
[SPEAKER_02]: out every year, but whenever we think
about what do we price this at,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, is, is, is that's a,
that's a huge conversation for us every
[SPEAKER_02]: single fucking year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, things are changing now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, back in the day when we first
came out, we were part of, part of
[SPEAKER_02]: aficionado was so we could establish,
you know, one of the world's first luxury
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really it was, we wanted to sell,
we wanted to sell to the kind of guys we
[SPEAKER_02]: were selling packs to.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to sell people that like didn't
look like weed people, but removing a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of money in the weed industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of your growers don't look like we
peel those regular people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are the kinds of guys I want to,
I wanted to market too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, if you were willing to spend
$500 on a box of seeds, you either one
[SPEAKER_02]: would do everything fucking possible to
make sure you're going to grow the fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: shit at that $500 box of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or two, you're raw enough where you're
going, damn, I got 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Worst case scenario, I'll get 50% females.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's five plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, the reasoning was like,
oh, if five plants, that's five to eight
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Make my investment way over, you know,
so, but those, but that, that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that market dynamic doesn't exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, now fire genetics are accessible
at all kinds of price points, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so when it comes to pricing, you know,
we're always going to have a high price
[SPEAKER_02]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strain because there's things that we've
been working on for a while and that just
[SPEAKER_02]: stand out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it's definitely something
that needs to change with the times,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we're always going to have our,
our 500, you know, the $800 boxes of
[SPEAKER_02]: strands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those will sell out and people always
auction those.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have control over that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that inflates the value too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I also know what it's like
to not have the money to spend on like
[SPEAKER_02]: $500, you know, boxes of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we definitely have some more
accessible strains coming out this year
[SPEAKER_02]: for people that want to be able to
experience it, but we'll offer at a lower
[SPEAKER_02]: price point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to be like less quality?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're actually like, you know,
some of our best, we're going to put at
[SPEAKER_02]: that lower price point, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to make a point, you know,
because we understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it's, it's a, it's a
difficult concept when you, when people
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about pricing, because it also goes
in like your brand, like what's,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's the goal of your price?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm only going to make these strains
once.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why we price them that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think if you're going to make them
over and over, then they have to not be,
[SPEAKER_02]: then that level of prestige pricing
doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to end up frying yourself and
people are going to feel like they got
[SPEAKER_02]: cheated or you're just, you're going to
turn into another doggie's nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember doggie's nuts back in the day?
[SPEAKER_02]: They were selling $700 seed packs and
everybody was upset with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, come out of the blue selling $700
seed packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, it brings up a good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what would you say to someone if
they were after one of your more expensive
[SPEAKER_04]: strains specifically, but they just didn't
really have the financial freedom to get
[SPEAKER_04]: it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, do you have any kind of
creative solutions?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, usually we hear a lot of these,
I stay off the gram doing, I don't do any
[SPEAKER_02]: business on IG.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my role.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't interface with consumers on that
level on IG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause when we do have that interface,
it's usually on a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I meet all kinds of people at
shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like, you know, they'll show us a
lot of love and they'd be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yo, I really, I don't have enough money
for this, but I have this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll hook you up, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, especially like,
you know, I give a lot at the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for a year, they didn't want me to
sell seeds at the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they were like, bro, you,
you hook everybody up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need, you're too fucking nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like, you know, cause I really just
want people to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like a fishing out of the brand
and the pricing is to show the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the potential of Northern
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want people to stop taking it
seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to do something for us so we
can, you know, so I'm trying to be a part
[SPEAKER_02]: of this ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So more people could, you know,
build up this ecosystem to make more high
[SPEAKER_02]: end brands across the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, I mean, across
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think you could argue it'll extend
across the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think a lot of people are familiar
with your refund policy, but let's just
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of put it into question form.
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you say to someone if they said
they were kind of unhappy with a pack of
[SPEAKER_04]: your seeds or something along those lines?
[SPEAKER_04]: And does that ever really happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone has different rooms and
environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to, it's a fucking seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody grows differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our seeds are grown in a certain
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it definitely happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I try to make an effort, you know,
if we've had a few email accounts shut
[SPEAKER_02]: down and get hacked over the past few
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been, you know, kind of hard for
us to get back to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we always try to replace the packs,
especially if it's at a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just hook you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're like unhappy and you show me
your certificate, like this was garbage,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, I'll just give you a pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but if you hold onto the seeds,
you don't open them, we'll buy it back
[SPEAKER_02]: from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we'll only pay the wholesale
price because that's what we get paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll pay you what we get paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do that every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait till people come up to the
booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't wait for that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: People to fucking sell me back my seeds
because the first three years we sold
[SPEAKER_02]: everything, like everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know we didn't have a whole lot of
white cashmere seeds left and probably had
[SPEAKER_02]: like 20, 30 of those left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like when someone came by the booth
last year and they sold me back,
[SPEAKER_02]: they wanted me to buy back two boxes of
cashmere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave them more than the wholesale price
at that point because I really wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: those fucking packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's an interesting point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that it might be something
which continues into the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that's just a part of the
high kind of prestige and value of the
[SPEAKER_04]: brand?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you think this might even be
adopted?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: The function of it was so your strains
always have value.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Louis Vuitton follows a certain
model.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you never find a Louis Vuitton
at a fucking thrift store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you take a real authentic Louis
Vuitton person like Louis Vuitton,
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll give you cash for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It always holds a cash value.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was inspired by that.
[SPEAKER_02]: When doing the Fissionado, I was like,
you know, if these things are still sealed
[SPEAKER_02]: up and the vials and the boxes are set up
in a way so we can preserve these fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll buy it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will buy it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought that was a great thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm stoked every time someone keeps a box
long enough for me to buy back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because chances are, I probably don't have
boxes of that strain because we sell
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sell everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We make new stuff every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just how it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So over the past, say, five to 10 years,
at least as far as I can see, there's been
[SPEAKER_04]: this growing demand for the use of growing
from seed outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's plenty of advantageous
reasons, particularly the taproot and all
[SPEAKER_04]: the benefits it brings with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: With that in mind, do you consider the
idea of catering to these kind of outdoor
[SPEAKER_04]: growers who are looking for like your 50
or your 100 pack seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you were local in Mendocino and
Humboldt, there was this rule for a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you knew me, if you knew me personally
or you knew me through a friend,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd give you free seeds if you lived
anywhere between Arcata and Ukiah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the longest time, I was,
you know, and that was kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the thing with, you know,
back in the day with when I was working
[SPEAKER_02]: with me and Gene is we always had the
homies come by the booth and we always
[SPEAKER_02]: gave them seeds because, you know,
we came from a point of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though, like when I was making my own
seeds and doing my own thing before
[SPEAKER_02]: aficionado, I was like just giving them
away to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, hey, how's, you know, see how this
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something I made, you know,
with Mike back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, tell me how it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like I've always given the
homie seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I going to charge you now that I have a
company?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like I always, you know,
made an effort to show love to the growers
[SPEAKER_02]: that made all the magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always saw the growers and Humboldt
Mendo as the key, the key, the key
[SPEAKER_02]: clientele that that could help our
restraints, you know, reach a new level.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so when it came to those guys,
you know, hell yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but these are mostly on a personal basis
where I'll, you know, I'll break you off
[SPEAKER_02]: like 50 to 100 seeds, you know,
to sift through, you know, but we're
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing that that's going away now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the days of growing big ass
outdoor plant patches, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to get smaller and smaller
because the name of the game now is clones
[SPEAKER_02]: and tissue culture and getting that
consistent canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, the breeding is going to
change according to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always going to breed for outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always going to breed for outdoor
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always going to have those strains
because that's what we are before
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a fucking outdoor grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's like, that was my
passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, you know, we'll make some
strains indoors, but we'll always make our
[SPEAKER_02]: best strains outdoors under the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's a rule we just can't fucking
deviate from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you believe that seeds produced
organically under the sun give like the
[SPEAKER_04]: most healthiest and optimal seeds or do
you think that 100% 100% people say it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take your pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take your pregnant wife,
stick her in a closet for nine months,
[SPEAKER_02]: feed her pizza and fucking soda,
you know, put a light on her.
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll probably survive, but I guarantee
that fucking baby ain't going to turn out
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like the inputs, 30,000 genes
are in the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every input matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we look at that and we're
geneticists, we're like, all right,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give this DNA everything it
needs to be successful for the next person
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to work these lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to give this genetic everything
that it evolved to uptake in half.
[SPEAKER_02]: People forget that this phenomenon of
cultivation is wholly happened in the span
[SPEAKER_02]: of the last 60 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And in big cannabis cultivation,
this phenomenon has only happened,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, fuck the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like people have to also
remember like this plant evolved for
[SPEAKER_02]: millions of years under sunlight and
organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just a fucking fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes, so that's our,
that's our, that's the core philosophy is
[SPEAKER_02]: providing the plants genetics,
everything that it needs, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that it evolved to excel with,
you know, and then we'll try to
[SPEAKER_02]: supercharge that aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that nutrition of your seeds
is so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I see people fertilizing seeds,
but with salt based nutrients,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, it's not the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the fucking same.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take, you take two prize fighters,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You could take two prize fighters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, let's say we take two clones and,
and, and you fucking make seeds that are,
[SPEAKER_02]: that are, that are inorganic with salt
based inputs grown on walk wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you make seeds that are made in soil,
have a high amino acid content,
[SPEAKER_02]: have, you know, um, a high content of
organic matter, have high content of,
[SPEAKER_02]: of, of minerals, you know, cause a lot of
the problems isn't an MPK problem in
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mineral deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, you know, in genetics,
the genetic building blocks are all built
[SPEAKER_02]: on these essential minerals and amino
acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it's like, it's essential to
have these inputs present in the soil and
[SPEAKER_02]: present in your regimen to just get your
fucking seeds in your babies to have their
[SPEAKER_02]: very best start.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you take a prize fighter and you
feed one, you know, you feed one the right
[SPEAKER_02]: diet he's supposed to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other one, you feed them vodka and
pizza before a fucking fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're definitely going to see
the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I see the difference in people's genetics
when they, when they don't, when they make
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds without, without organic inputs,
I see a distinct difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how would you feel about people making
F2s and F3s of your line for their own
[SPEAKER_04]: use?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess in general, how do you feel
about people breeding with your work?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the biggest gift you could do for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's, you know, people think
that the gift stops when you buy the seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: and you grow it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But man, when you choose to F2 it,
F3 it, F4 it, man, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, make that line your line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause at least you're working it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of work that goes into that
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like, anybody who's willing to
do that, man, like nothing but love and
[SPEAKER_02]: respect, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, fuck, let's share some seed stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me some of yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you some of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, it's all kinds of
opportunities for that, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I see people work the genetics,
man, that's just like the, the greatest
[SPEAKER_02]: gift.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the best complete circle to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause better than the, it's better than,
you know, than selling the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that's, that's the, the, to me,
that's the, the, um, the validation as a
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder when not only has it expressed
itself good enough in flower to meet
[SPEAKER_02]: their, you know, to, to meet their
expectations, but it's exceeded their
[SPEAKER_02]: expectations to a point where they choose
to continue working that line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's just the hugest,
most humbling gift to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in a previous episode, we had Mean Gene
on and he said he really enjoyed all the
[SPEAKER_04]: work he's done with aficionado.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one thing he felt was that it carried
a bit of a labor with it for like being
[SPEAKER_04]: the absolute best.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said that he just felt like that
was a lot of pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you kind of agree with that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel the pressure sometimes?
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when Gene was talking about
that, man, cause like, yeah, he would have
[SPEAKER_02]: every year you'd have something that was
crazy fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but it would be the, but I don't
think it's good enough for aficionado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like having to meet that bar is pretty
fucking stressful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to keep doing that and meeting these
expectations is, is, is, uh, I think I was
[SPEAKER_02]: a little short sighted.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first came up with that concept,
but I'm already all the way in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to keep swimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't drown now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to keep swimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to hold that line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I kind of percent feel gene on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, you know, when you're trying to
meet, meet that level of quality and
[SPEAKER_02]: expectation, it's almost, um,
unsustainable really, if you really think
[SPEAKER_02]: about it, if you want to be hella real,
like it's, it's almost unsustainable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think it also, it also inhibits
you from from making other experiments you
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't otherwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're so focused on putting the
best out and you're always so focused on
[SPEAKER_02]: having the most elite shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look at what symbiotic did with
Larry OG and GDP.
[SPEAKER_02]: They create the purple punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't fuck what you say.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just not hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've sifted it this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, so, you know, when you're in
this mindset of like, man, we only have to
[SPEAKER_02]: put the most exclusive genetics,
the best possible genetics on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think it kind of takes away from
the artistry because you're always trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to meet a certain expectation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not doing it just for the love of
the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I got to be real,
you know, when, um, when, when,
[SPEAKER_02]: when Gene and I kind of went on our
separate ways, I think that was a point in
[SPEAKER_02]: my game personally, when, um, when I don't
think my head was all the way in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was that probably that,
that, that was probably one of those that
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think based on just how long I've been
doing shit, I got lucky with myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got lucky with my selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got lucky with the selections and I was
able to, to, to, to meet a certain mark
[SPEAKER_02]: and expectation for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, it's, it's, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tough trying to fucking always hold
that line and do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like what Gene's doing
right now with his lines is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he could do anything he fucking
wants, you know, like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's music to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could do anything you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's freedom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you could really make good
music.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the reasons why we
started a French connection with my
[SPEAKER_02]: partner, Professor Q, um, was it's a,
it's an outlet for us to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: explore a lot of these more contemporary
flavors and find new flavors that
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily don't fit the aficionado
paradigm of what people expect,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, you know, are something that can
still exceed all expectations.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, the, the, the genetics,
you know, symbiotic and sea junkie are
[SPEAKER_02]: working with, they're not the most crazy
exclusive genetics, but they're incredibly
[SPEAKER_02]: good breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why the quality comes out of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're able to, to select and find things
out of, you know, normally found strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and some rare strains and create
something entirely fucking different in,
[SPEAKER_02]: in, in, in pivotal, you know, so that's
the magic of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, going back to your thing
with like, you know, uh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was hella fucking hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't blame them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't blame them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So tell us a little more about Professor
Q.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think people are as familiar with
him as they are yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, so we're in spandibus two years ago,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Frenchie goes to spandibus a week before
me and, um, to do about two classes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I told Frenchie before he goes to
Spain, I'm like, I'm looking for the
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking skunk Frenchie at the time,
you know, before Duke Diamond released all
[SPEAKER_02]: his skunk crosses and stuff, you know,
we were talking to James, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was a bounty, you know, everybody
had a bounty on skunk, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, I'm going to find this,
you know, cause you know, being a,
[SPEAKER_02]: that, that was, that, that was the unique
edge I had in aficionado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't that not, that was the best
breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really able to find good genetics
because I was able to find the good
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds, you know, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we find good pounds, like who,
who's a farmer, who does this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with Quentin, um, Frenchie puts the
word out at his class to all the French
[SPEAKER_02]: cronies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes, I'm looking, we're looking for
skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then two weeks passes by, we're at
spandibus and these two shady ass looking
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking French gangsters come up to the
table.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a big iPad and they're like,
are you Leo?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking for Leo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tell my partners in the booth,
I was like, it's about to get heavy guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what they want, but it's
going to be ugly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had these mean mugs, mean mugging
ass faces.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I looked, dude looks at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, uh, we represent Quentin.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, we heard you looking for the
skunk and they pull out the iPad and they
[SPEAKER_02]: show me pictures of the, of the skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they said they got it from high
pro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and you know, this, the French people
been holding it directly from high pro who
[SPEAKER_02]: got it from a flying Dutchman.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a verified, um, flying
Dutchman cut of the, uh, uh, roadkill
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they show me a sample of the hash
and I'm like, well, where's this dude at?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, well, he doesn't want to
come and spandibus.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants to meet you at like, you know,
he wants to meet you at a private
[SPEAKER_02]: location.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, all right, this is kind of
weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, he tells us where to meet
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: We meet him at this bar and then,
uh, we go, we're at this bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the waitress is super nice to this
fucking guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, and he's the most humble
guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, it's just some tall guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He looks kind of, he looks like a
gangster, but he's like the most humble,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, calm, you know, soft spoken
dude, you know, you'd ever fucking meet,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we were just talking and he was
like, yeah, I have the skunk and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to, you know, I want to offer it to
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be able to work with you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, come up to, come up to
the countryside near the French border.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to show you my place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I, you know, after the cup,
you know, after spandibus, we went to his
[SPEAKER_02]: place, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had, he lived in the most beautiful
part of, of Spain outside this town called
[SPEAKER_02]: Girona.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where they filmed a lot of the
episodes of game of Thrones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he had this grow there that was so
fucking clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could eat and off the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was so passionate about,
you know, working with aficionado.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, I'll give all this up to have
a chance to work with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and he left it at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for like the next week,
he showed us the most beautiful places of
[SPEAKER_02]: Spain and we just chilled.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't any business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just had a really good feeling about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this dude could look at any
fucking plant and tell you the scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: name of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he went to France's, you know,
their equivalent to MIT of horticulture
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's the university of Antibes where
he specialized in tissue culture and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was like, it was, it was kind of
like meeting him was almost as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking magical as meeting Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that was made to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it just so happens that the guy
that's kind of Quentin's OG from back in
[SPEAKER_02]: the day in Nice, France was Frenchy's
homie.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were partying with in Goa.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how does this happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, we didn't, I was like,
dude, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, and so Quentin had to
come, you know, he came to California and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we restructured the company and
I was like, bro, you know, you're my
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I want to like, let's,
let's take over the world together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, now he's a full partner
and aficionado and he's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: he was definitely, you know, one of the
best breeders, best botanist
[SPEAKER_02]: horticulturist I've ever met, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's one of the most passionate people
about plants you'd ever fucking meet.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the most knowledgeable people about
botany.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, how do you know so many
scientific plant names and where they come
[SPEAKER_02]: from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's just unreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not just a cannabis person.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a fucking plant person.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the magic of professor Q,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So him having the skunk was just like an
entry into, you know, under just
[SPEAKER_02]: scratching the iceberg of like this guy's
potential, you know, like me and Frenchy
[SPEAKER_02]: looked at him.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were like, you know, talking,
it was like, man, this guy's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking huge one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was going to be huge, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and he was also generally a good guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, look, man, this is what I
want to work with you, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't want to make the mistakes I've
made with other breeders where I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really play my cards right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you're so raw, you're going
to want to do your own thing one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's work on aficionado and let's
build a company around you to your own
[SPEAKER_02]: brand where you could, where you could
fucking express yourself and you could be
[SPEAKER_02]: your own person, you know, and,
and it just be kind of like this record
[SPEAKER_02]: label shit and he was down and that's how
it's been working, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we both work on aficionado and then
like, you know, French connection is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is, is our opportunity to, to,
to do really exciting things in Europe
[SPEAKER_02]: with a lot of really bad ass French
operators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause when the Frenchie and I went to
Spain, it's universal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best fucking growers in Europe are in
the UK and, and France.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry to all my French people,
my Spanish people listening and Alberto,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're in Barcelona right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you're one of the best too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but, but universally, man,
the guys in France and UK, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: they brought some fucking heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw some crazy shit like shit,
the kind of talent where if you brought it
[SPEAKER_02]: to Cali, you could sell it for Cali
prices.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that fucking good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They give Cali people around for that
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, that was definitely,
you know, professor Q that was kind of our
[SPEAKER_02]: whole thing was like, man, we can make
something bigger than aficionado and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: more comfortable on an international
scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I grew up in Japan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was 20 started my career when I was
in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: So going to Europe with friend,
with, with Quentin and doing these new,
[SPEAKER_02]: exciting things makes sense while,
you know, we allow aficionado to be what
[SPEAKER_02]: it always has been.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it based out of California,
keep it pure, you know, cause we're only
[SPEAKER_02]: going to release three to five strains a
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, for the rest of the company's
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, we have a very specific
focus for what we want to do, but the
[SPEAKER_02]: music we're going to make with Quentin,
that's what I'm really excited about too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any other breeders you plan to
do collaborations with?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who I just hit up this morning?
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit up Miss Jill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit up Miss Jill cause I've been
breeding a lot of strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been breeding a lot of strains more
geared towards the female pallet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, my sister who's French,
she's apprentice kind of really inspired
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: She kind of indirectly inspired me on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause she liked a certain flavor profile
and her friends like a certain player
[SPEAKER_02]: profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, fuck, I wonder if I could
breed for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I forgot where I was getting to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other breeders you want to collab
with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so my, my, my reason for hitting on
Miss Jill was she's got some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: craziest flavors that females love,
like the, like the jelly bean,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Asian orange, like these really
incredible, exotic, crazy pronounced
[SPEAKER_02]: tones.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't find a lot of cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she was someone I hit up this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked her if she was down and she was
like, yeah, man, let's rap later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another breeder, I'm really looking
forward to doing some work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've kind of really collabed
with a lot of breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always kind of just did our own thing
and made our own music, but that's
[SPEAKER_02]: something that I definitely want to
change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there's a lot of talent out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of breeders, you know,
I want to put off the notion that I'm too
[SPEAKER_02]: good to work with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it was never like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just always in my own world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a, I'm pretty reclusive by nature
anyway, you know, so I was just in my own
[SPEAKER_02]: world working on my own thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I tend to get distracted easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, being able to work with
different breeders, you know, I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: work with, I, you know, in house,
in house is killing it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely like to work with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he was someone I like to work
with.
Compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: These aren't guys I'm planning to work
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are just guys I'm fans of because
their work's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compound's work is really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, if I could collab with,
with, with a breeder one day, whoever's
[SPEAKER_02]: running symbiotic, I think it's biologist
420, but I could be wrong, but whoever's
[SPEAKER_02]: doing their breeding is doing some
incredible work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I sifted through their, their purple
punch F2s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just can't believe you got that
expression out of GDP and OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you select for it to get it to look
like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's like what he did was what I
always try to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in 303 seeds, some cat out of fucking
Colorado, believe it or not, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was like California guys kind of hate
on Colorado guys, but we just gotta be
[SPEAKER_02]: real, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some cats of Colorado bring some
flame.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 303 seeds was one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did the jet, the G6 jet fuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was, he was able to get an
expression of sour that I've been trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to get for seven years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he was, he, he, he nailed it on
the G6 jet fuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if I could work with
someone, it'd be someone definitely like
[SPEAKER_02]: that too, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the flip side, what are just some
general genetics, whether it be land race
[SPEAKER_04]: or modern that you kind of want to work
into an aficionado strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like we've been sifting through the
Lebanese for a while and that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: turn into a long-term project because you
know, you could cross things with things
[SPEAKER_02]: that sound exotic, but is the end product
going to be exotic?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so we're really going to open up
the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to, you know, a lot of these
really exciting flavors come from Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, the, the essence of Royal
Kush, you know, I always thought that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, Mandelbrot was trying to go
towards the sour D side of things with the
[SPEAKER_02]: Royal Kush until I finally grew his F1
clone, the Magnum Opus and the original
[SPEAKER_02]: release of Long Valley directly next to an
Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't, you know, there was
literally until last year, I saw that
[SPEAKER_02]: observation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he was selecting for.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where all those crazy flavors in
the original Royal Kush 7 coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't coming from the Ganni.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't coming from the sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was complimented by that,
but man, those, those crazy tense piercing
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit tones were coming from the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm definitely going back into the
Urkel again, doing some exploring into
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we made a crazy cross last year with
one of the contemporary Australians,
[SPEAKER_02]: Grape Pie.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got one of the cuts of Grape Pie from
one of our buddies in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cut came from LA and we crossed it
with the, the Rose Especial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just were like, we'll see what's
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we didn't really pop the seeds this
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Royal Key, Josh from Royal Key
Organics ran the seed and he found some
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He ended up giving us two males back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We flowered the males out and there were
some of the frostiest males we've ever
[SPEAKER_02]: seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something we're going to explore
that, that cultivar a lot more next year
[SPEAKER_02]: and see what we could select, see if it
meets certain expectations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I'm really excited about
working the original diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met Strawberry Jerry from, God damn it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember his fucking company name.
[SPEAKER_02]: He released Strawberry Jerry.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a super talented breeder from the
East.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coast and he's got a back cross of the
original diesel mutter, but that's sour
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel, original diesel, the mom that made
sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's got a back cross of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's definitely something I'm really
excited to work in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've kind of been collecting pollen and
storing a few things because Capulator
[SPEAKER_02]: gave us, he gifted Leo from blockchain to
give to me a pack of this orange apricot
[SPEAKER_02]: times Mac crossed our chem dog special
reserve.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Leo ended up keeping the two females
out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we ran all the males in our indoor and
the males are fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we put it, we put the male on,
on one of my white cash mirrors to see
[SPEAKER_02]: what happened, but like, we're just going
to test that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have no intention of releasing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make anywhere from like 30 strains a
year on average, you know, but we only
[SPEAKER_02]: release like five to six.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like part of, part of me,
you know, breeding is just seeing what
[SPEAKER_02]: things have in them, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do they cross, you know,
how they look and not everything that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to cross, I'm going to, I'm going to
produce or sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of this is for
observation, just like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're only going to be a good breeder as,
as many strains as you grow and you fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: with too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I also see the virtue in,
in working with other breeders and
[SPEAKER_02]: collaborating with other breeders,
getting that extra set of eyes,
[SPEAKER_02]: getting that extra perspective on what a
certain direction could take, you know
[SPEAKER_02]: what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'll be, I'll be honest,
you know, like if I don't have,
[SPEAKER_02]: if I don't have Quentin, you know,
here most of the time in Frenchie,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd probably be full of shit, you know,
cause you could believe your own shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You tell yourself in your head,
but if you don't have another informed
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder going, no, I don't think that's
the right direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should go this way and you can
look at objectively and go, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're right, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so, you know, these breeders
that I'm talking about that I want to work
[SPEAKER_02]: with, you know, in their strains,
it's because I'm seeing shit in their work
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're making selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're coming with flavors that nobody
else is making, you know, that's magic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, on the topic of creation and
whatnot, seed testing is always a topic of
[SPEAKER_04]: interest to me in the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to see people use testers,
but we've steered away from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people do in-house testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do you guys sit?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've never done testers ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've always, it's always been our policy
to vigorously test in-house.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're, when you're outsourcing,
testing, it's kind of like the risk of
[SPEAKER_02]: licensing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're, you're expecting a certain,
a certain standard to be met in your
[SPEAKER_02]: absence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's always a risk, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially with breeders, breeders need,
breeders always need to have things a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain fucking way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and we're the same way too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, I vigorously test,
you know, we have a vigorous testing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, program, you know, where like
the whole time that we test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we test, this is like a,
you know, how we test, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like we'll make a strain and then we'll
test it its first year, outdoors,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll test it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we get, you know, we get a full
six to eight months, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: living with this strain, seeing how it
works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also we take cluts, cuts during,
when it's growing, we take cuts of the
[SPEAKER_02]: females, we take cuts to the males,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: One for preservation and two for fucking
stress testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to see what's in, what's in these
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, when we grow, I'm
basically giving the seeds and their
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, the best possible
environment, you know, it's like you,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's how you want to treat, you know,
your pregnant wife, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to give her just nothing but love
and a comfortable environment and just no
[SPEAKER_02]: stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that baby comes out its best possible
self, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with, so we need that to happen in
the garden where things are producing or
[SPEAKER_02]: where we're getting a feel for,
you know, cultivating these things under
[SPEAKER_02]: ideal conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you also have to test things under
unideal conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to kind of be a fucking asshole
and subject the girls that you love to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a certain degree of pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially the boys, we call,
we, you know, the champagne room,
[SPEAKER_02]: the reason why we call our male room,
the champagne room is cause it's the final
[SPEAKER_02]: place you go after you get your ass beat
in fight club.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's initial male selection for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes through fight club.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, we have to see what the fuck
the strain can deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really where a lot of your
testing is going to come from.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, testing as far as like
germination, that's something you should
[SPEAKER_02]: always do in house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Test the fuck a germ on your seeds,
test the progeny, see if they grow out
[SPEAKER_02]: well, you know, but, you know,
I think there's also a lot of value in
[SPEAKER_02]: having other talented growers test your
shit too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think you have to be really,
you have to be really fucking,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to be really decisive on who you
choose to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be a lot of trust and there
has to be, you know, a set of rules,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in an agreement that has to be
honored between the breeder and the guy
[SPEAKER_02]: that's testing it, you know, because a lot
of the reason people don't like testers is
[SPEAKER_02]: because, you know, things could end up
getting stolen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know certain people's security,
you know, so, you know, as a breeder,
[SPEAKER_02]: you just kind of want to control
everything, you know, best possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So aficionado as a brand has a lot of kind
of mystery and kind of mystique around it,
[SPEAKER_04]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: With that being said, what are the types
of things you get up to on an average
[SPEAKER_04]: basis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, are you just locked away breeding
most of the time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Short answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's, you know, so basically there's
like my day, I'm up at five or five to six
[SPEAKER_02]: every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a weed monk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get up at five or six every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work out and I do weed all the way until
I sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think, you know,
you need that kind of intense focus to be
[SPEAKER_02]: good at anything, you know, and it's like,
you know, I've really butted heads with
[SPEAKER_02]: this guy in the past and people know that
we kind of don't like each other publicly,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, Brandon from third gen,
a lot of you can either love him or hate
[SPEAKER_02]: him.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one thing that I learned from him
was, was I'd never seen somebody work
[SPEAKER_02]: harder in the industry than that
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so seeing, you know, and a lot of
people have, you know, you could say
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you can, but he earned,
he earned everything he's fucking earned
[SPEAKER_02]: through hard fucking work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the guy's talented, but hard
work beats talent every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's, I never seen someone work that
intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I've always, you know,
looked at Brandon as someone I had to kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of keep up with, you know, and it was kind
of using, you know, using a rival to your
[SPEAKER_02]: advantage where you could find inspiration
from someone you don't get along with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could see, you could kind of see the
strengths they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, you know, seeing guys at the
top of their game, seeing how many fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: hours they put into their business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with Kevin Jodry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That motherfucker is a workaholic.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a workhorse.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the dude never stops working.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that, that inspires me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I followed the hip hop industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, most, some of your most
successful artists don't fucking sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they sleep, but they work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it takes that level of focus and
attention to detail to be successful at
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like, I've gotten through
times in my life where I've deepened my,
[SPEAKER_02]: where my focus and my cognition is
deviated from where it should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in, but knowing that if I really want
to be in this industry, make something,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to be successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to be super fucking disciplined.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this isn't just because I own,
you know, we have our own businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that we could fuck off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you have to be incredibly
fucking disciplined because no matter how
[SPEAKER_02]: hard you're working, I really feel that
there's other people out there that are
[SPEAKER_02]: more hungry that are fucking working
harder than you to take away what you have
[SPEAKER_02]: or to fucking, you know, get better at you
in the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just going to fucking happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like my regular day, it's like,
you know, I have to manage the indoor,
[SPEAKER_02]: the outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check on emails, check on sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we have a really small type,
you know, type family through a small type
[SPEAKER_02]: network, you know, and we really like to,
we operate like we hustle.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't like to really share about,
share a lot about what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just like to show people the end
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: We feel that's part of the magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when, when you go to a magic
show and someone shows you how the magic
[SPEAKER_02]: trick is done, it kind of loses its,
it's, it's mystique.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of loses, it loses the magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we figured if we just like,
really focus on the fucking craft and just
[SPEAKER_02]: whenever you'll see us, we're just
communicating some fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's that, that's our goal,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it just takes a certain lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely a lot of sacrifice,
you know, it's definitely sacrifice
[SPEAKER_02]: partying a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's partying a lot when I first
started fishing auto, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: now, you know, just I've learned by being
in the game that if you want to be
[SPEAKER_02]: relevant, you got to work harder than the
guy that's working harder than you to get
[SPEAKER_02]: in the game right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what keeps me hungry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, my normal day is busy
as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm usually up at five or six,
done at 11, go to bed at 12, do it all
[SPEAKER_02]: over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes go to bed at two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Workaholic by the sounds of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit, you know, it's, but it's
like, you know, everybody thinks it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: cool idea to start their own company until
you're actually doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have to see what goes into
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, I have a lot of people
I aspire to kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: get to the level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just kind of emulate their,
their work habits and their intensity when
[SPEAKER_02]: they approach their craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, certain producers I know
that I really look up to and certain
[SPEAKER_02]: businessmen that I know I would look up to
that they have these, these work ethics
[SPEAKER_02]: that man, if I want to get to that level,
I have to fuck a work that hard or harder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess shout out to Brendan from third
gen one love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One love, you know, like we've,
you know, we've, you know, we've had
[SPEAKER_02]: people publicly know we don't get along,
but my voice and the thing is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: just cause I don't like you doesn't mean I
can't respect you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And just, you know, like there's always,
you know, everyone's got something about
[SPEAKER_02]: their hustle and their intensity that if
you just put us, put away your fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: ego, man, you can see, you can really see
the value of these motherfuckers bring to
[SPEAKER_02]: the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, aside from all the ego show IG,
it's like, no one worked harder than that
[SPEAKER_02]: motherfucker that do work hard as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same thing with gene, you know,
no one makes no one breeds and observes on
[SPEAKER_02]: a level that gene does, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, you know, being in
proximity, those guys showed me a standard
[SPEAKER_02]: of, of, of, of where we should operate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then not abiding by those and making
my mistakes or fuckups further reinforces
[SPEAKER_02]: how we should emulate how certain guys
like that operate that intensity,
[SPEAKER_02]: that dedication, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely like a spiritual journey.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a little bit unrelated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know what's your prediction.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your prediction on the next big
thing to hit the industry or the next big
[SPEAKER_04]: wave, whatever you want to call it and how
do you plan to ride it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think like the big thing in what context
and the big thing in like the flower
[SPEAKER_02]: market and genetics market, you know,
it's, you know, next big strain,
[SPEAKER_02]: next big phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I really think the next big thing
happened with big L bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, you know, it's, is it,
is it set in stone?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't tell yet, but, but is it
happening right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the opportunity here right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what, that's what real people in
the industry needed so hard was,
[SPEAKER_02]: was to be able to participate at that
level and separate themselves from the
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking corporate booth squad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so like, to me, that's like,
you know, some people can say that's not a
[SPEAKER_02]: big phenomenon and motherfuckers and price
gouging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, that, that customer demographic
exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're underserved.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the reason why Audemars, Pigette,
Ferrari and Rolex are in business is
[SPEAKER_02]: customers of this demographic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like, they need to be served.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, and just because you serve them
at that, at that price point, doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_02]: you could offer things at a other price
point too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not binary.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cannabis isn't binary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just, it's not black or white,
you know, so, you know, I think that's
[SPEAKER_02]: like the biggest thing that's happening to
the culture right now that people really
[SPEAKER_02]: don't appreciate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that we have this new opportunity to
really be like wine, to really be like
[SPEAKER_02]: craft spirits, to really be like high-end
Cuban cigars.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so why resist this opportunity
when it's going to be, what's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: save us later down the line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the questions we received from a
few different fans over the period of this
[SPEAKER_04]: show is that basically they're always
interested in knowing how is it you go
[SPEAKER_04]: about sourcing all of the rare genetics?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know before you mentioned that it was
through, you know, bags and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_04]: but obviously some of the stuff you have
access to, which is really old,
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't come from a bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it like a real, Oh, it wasn't from
bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, when it came, when I said in
that context, when the person would bring
[SPEAKER_02]: the packs over, I'd be like, where's the
farmer at?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to meet the farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they, if they wouldn't introduce me to
the farmer, I'd give them some fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: fire ass seeds or a fire ass clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, dude, introduce me to the
farmer, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to want this clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just in general, how do you go about
procuring these more rare and obscure
[SPEAKER_04]: Australians?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, all over, you know, sometimes,
you know, some people will be talking to
[SPEAKER_02]: Frenchie, you know, I've met, um,
you know, really it happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always different, you know,
back in the day, um, before, before
[SPEAKER_02]: everything went legal, it was really
through when I was still, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: when I was still really active,
you know, uh, doing other things is when I
[SPEAKER_02]: was really collecting the strains,
meeting farmers, you know, driving
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of miles, putting thousands of
miles on my fucking vehicle every week
[SPEAKER_02]: just to meet farmers, um, making deals
happen and so I could find genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now, now it's a lot different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's the culture changed, the
landscape changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're getting our genetics from,
you know, from, you know, just random
[SPEAKER_02]: people now, like not random people,
but like people that we meet through our
[SPEAKER_02]: network that we never would have thought
would brought this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have to verify these genetics
and grow them out and see if it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: what they say it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of the times, you know,
the hardest part about obtaining genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: is getting it from a rare source that's
willing to share it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The game's changed now where a lot of
people really realize the value in their
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's getting harder for a lot of
breeders to, to obtain, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: new gear unless you're collabing with
people or, or you're, or you're straight
[SPEAKER_02]: up buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've never been, you know,
uh, uh, I've never been a huge,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a seed seed collector in the sense
where I collect other companies packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, I want the shit that comes in
a Ziploc bag, you know, that came from
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking Thailand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, or the stuff that we got from
Lebanon, like the seeds we got from
[SPEAKER_02]: Lebanon was, uh, we could congratulate
professor Q, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really hard to get those.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were from, they were late seventies
stocks that was just opened up a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago and then, um, open pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and that came directly from,
from, from Lebanon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, and then we got that from came
from Lebanon and ended up landing in Spain
[SPEAKER_02]: where we were sifting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, I don't know how fucking I got
to Spain, but Quentin calling one day and
[SPEAKER_02]: he was like, dude, I got the Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were so happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were fucking so happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, finding the strain is,
is the hardest part.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's like, when you look at a
producer, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was mentioning earlier that,
you know, producer's job is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, to create shape and shift the future
of music, you know, then I have to quote
[SPEAKER_02]: funk master flex was one who says that,
that producers create shape and shift the
[SPEAKER_02]: future music board.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also with these producers, and DJs do is
they do some, they have this culture of
[SPEAKER_02]: digging where they, where they,
where they go through and they dig through
[SPEAKER_02]: records so they can find new sounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where you, where you obtain these new
records and these new tracks and how you
[SPEAKER_02]: obtain them is always a fucking secret to
DJs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people were like back
in the day, you know, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: motherfuckers always ask other producers
DJs like, Hey, where are you getting these
[SPEAKER_02]: tracks or where are you getting these
samples from?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's part of their, that's part
of their magic and how they acquired
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds, you know, like I've always just had
a really, you know, that was kind of one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the weird things I fell into.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just, I ended up getting really
lucky at finding good genetics because,
[SPEAKER_02]: because of business pipelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just keep following those
pipelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just keep, you know, I keep,
you know, networking with people and I
[SPEAKER_02]: share a lot of genetics too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, it's not like I'm just like,
look, going out, looking for shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, you know, I have a lot of things
on my vault that I'm like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything you want?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, I'll make that happen,
you know, or, or the best of my ability.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually the best, the best way we
could get strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For real.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you feel like breeding with heirloom
or land race strains is able to help you
[SPEAKER_04]: remove what we would maybe refer to as the
ceiling or that inability to continue to
[SPEAKER_04]: get more and more high, which doesn't seem
to be occurring in like land race and
[SPEAKER_04]: heirloom varieties?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's really, difficult breeding
land race and heirloom varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds exotic until you're actually
doing it, you know, and then you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: go out and you have to make the crosses
and test it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, with a lot of these contemporary
strains, you could tell from the mother
[SPEAKER_02]: stock and what you select that you're
going to have a good probability of
[SPEAKER_02]: getting something that's going to meet a
certain level of expectation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you're working with land race,
your selection has to be fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: incredibly on point.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of really garbage land race,
but there's a lot of, really good stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's really difficult to access.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, for me, a lot of these
really difficult ones to access that I was
[SPEAKER_02]: been searching for years was, you know,
the, the, the broadleaf Burmese old school
[SPEAKER_02]: Burmese, the one that looks like,
Oh gee, you know, I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoked the Burmese.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first trip when I went to, I grew up in
Japan until I was 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first time I went to Thailand,
I was like 18 and my buddies came out and
[SPEAKER_02]: said, like, Hey, we were in the smoke weed
at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause weed is expensive as fuck in Japan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 70 bucks a gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we went to Thailand, you know,
it was just like smoke heaven.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember having a Burmese that was
rock fucking hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the one of the craziest highs
I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been kind of chasing one of those
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like exceedingly frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some of the weed we were getting
in Japan, a lot of it was coming from
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was coming in Nug form or it was
getting smuggled in from, from Cali from,
[SPEAKER_02]: from on the Navy ships with the sailors
and then they'd sell it to kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but when we went to Thailand,
we were, that was the first time I got to
[SPEAKER_02]: see like really good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got really lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't, it wasn't hydraulically pressed
or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a standard, what I wanted to
chase, you know, same thing with like an
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghani, like a real Afghani or like a,
like an incredible Pakistani that has not
[SPEAKER_02]: just frost, but a nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so you see a lot of these old
hash varieties, like they'll be crazy
[SPEAKER_02]: frosty, but they won't really have like a
definitive nose, something that you could
[SPEAKER_02]: breed with and that you're really certain
that you're going to get, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a new and exciting flavor from,
you know, so it's like, it's really,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned through trial and error that
when you're breeding land races,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's more of a long-term project and a lot
of it's going to be more research and
[SPEAKER_02]: development and recording your
observations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's going to take some time to get
that land race across to express itself in
[SPEAKER_02]: a manner that's going to meet the
expectations of what strains are doing
[SPEAKER_02]: these days, you know, with shit that
fucking.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, symbiotic and see junkies
releasing these crazy frosty profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's the new standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, if you want to breed with
land race strains that historically don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have these exaggerated frost profiles,
it's going to be more of a lot,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's, it's, it, you better have
a fucking good direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to go if you want to release
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's at least my two cents,
you know, and there's people that work a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of land races that have really good
work, AK bean brains.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the nature farm on IG, these guys are
crowing some crazy fucking land races,
[SPEAKER_02]: really rare shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think those guys might end up being some
of the next big guys in the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been seeing some crazy phenotypes and
collection coming out of their fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: feeds that I'm just like, how the fuck did
you get that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, that's the magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you get that?
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact is they got that and it's exotic
and they're going to be able to flex
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses their land races that are going to
hopefully prove themselves to be just as
[SPEAKER_02]: good, if not better than a lot of these
contemporary poly hybrids we're seeing on
[SPEAKER_02]: the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: So something I realize I haven't asked
you, what type of cannabis is your
[SPEAKER_04]: personal favorite?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you into stuff that's kind of like
going to more work you out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Stimulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff that don't sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I love gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, really my first love is
gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a really, I just, I get gas plants
and I get along with them really well as
[SPEAKER_02]: far as growing and smoking them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But man, my love is haze, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that crazy, you know, it looks like
someone just plucked your third eye out
[SPEAKER_02]: and just threw it in the outer space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's what I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the first time I smoked the C5 haze
in Spain was a crazy experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a 16 week flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't look, it looked airy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't really have a crazy unique nose
that I can remember right now and go,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, it's this flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just remember the high was so intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember the flavor, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was sitting in this house and a
great gardener says to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just all the way up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just straight up.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoke it straight up.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I smoke it and literally it feels like
someone grabs the side of your head and
[SPEAKER_02]: lifts you straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fuck up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had such a visceral sativa high
like that since I was a little kid in
[SPEAKER_02]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like my favorite weeds are
always going to be those old school
[SPEAKER_02]: sativas that kind of get hated on because
they take a long time to flower out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because to me, it's about the high,
like, you know, like, yeah, everyone says,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, it's medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is fucking medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got PTSD.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use it medicinally, but really like my,
my form of medicine is getting to this
[SPEAKER_02]: certain high so I could, I could interface
life at a, at a distance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different frequency.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like to me, like, you know,
the Hayes high did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll be real too with the other
straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love smoking that fucking love because
the high just makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The skittles, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people either hate that shit or they
love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it brought me a similar happy heady
high that I get when I smoke a lot of the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the old school and contemporary
Hayes as you find in Europe nowadays,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so I just, I don't like being
really stoned and sleepy because I'm busy
[SPEAKER_02]: as fuck all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like something that's going to,
you know, really pick me up and get me
[SPEAKER_02]: going, you know, almost like a,
like a proper sour diesel, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: where you could, you're noticeably high,
but you're not impaired to the point where
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to, it's going to inhibit,
you know, productivity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on that note of Gassy, we've mentioned
it earlier, the chem special reserve.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the popular ones I hear about
people from people all the time from you
[SPEAKER_04]: guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you plan to ever bring it back and work
with it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And broadly speaking, will you ever rework
any projects again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're in the middle of reworking the
white cashmere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, those, oh no, it was, yeah,
those packs coupled with the last like 30
[SPEAKER_02]: to 50 seeds we had, we went for broke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we never pop everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We popped everything this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got, we got males in cloned form.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saved all the females.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got tons of pollen stocked up,
but it depends on, on how good the strain
[SPEAKER_02]: is, you know, you know, we would really be
doing a lot of our clients a disservice if
[SPEAKER_02]: we were to release this, to do a rerelease
of the strain or to rework it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of takes from away from the allure
and the prestige of why they bought it in
[SPEAKER_02]: the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless it was one of those strains where,
cause a lot of the times in the first
[SPEAKER_02]: three years, these strains didn't get
saved.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were literally grown as big outdoor
plants and the packs were moved back East.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's just, what's the culture in
Humboldt and Mendo at the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, under certain
circumstances like that, like the white
[SPEAKER_02]: cashmere was one of those where a lot of
people really didn't save a cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of disappeared.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we have enough evidence that it's
disappeared, we'll fucking, we'll do a
[SPEAKER_02]: rerelease.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do an encore release, but we've
never purposely opened up a strain and
[SPEAKER_02]: then reworked it and released it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably the only one we've done that with
was like, you know, the Royal lions,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause every generation was different from
like, when we, when I got it as the Royal
[SPEAKER_02]: cast seven, then we brought it into eight
and nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every generation was fucking different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like now we have it at 12, you know,
we have it as like Magnum 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, and it's completely
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every generation is just like,
you know, there's something unique in
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we go back and we open things up,
it's if only if we could find an entirely
[SPEAKER_02]: new direction, then it becomes a new
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's actually a question we got asked
a lot about as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was your journey with Mandelbrot's
Royal and how did it go from being,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the, the Royal seven,
sorry, six to the Long Valley to kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: where it is now?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I met Mandelbrot through Kevin and
Shiloh at the Emerald Cup of 2013.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won in 2012 and then I got fourth place
with the Royal and I remember on the
[SPEAKER_02]: brief, on the card, it said who's the
breeder or who bred it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there was this thing I was like,
I remember reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't fucking know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to have, and cause I always heard
about him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know his name was Mandelbrot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always just heard about the guy that
bred the truth, the guy that bred the,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the, the Royal Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause these are the stain.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the strains that were going back
East and Dave Chappelle and common and
[SPEAKER_02]: most deaf were smoking on, you know,
the, the, the, the story on the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I heard it for Mandelbrot
was that's how the strain name got its
[SPEAKER_02]: true, got the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: The truth is, you know, Chappelle was
smoking some weed with, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is, this is, you know, this is,
you know, this came from, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting in Mandelbrot's car is like,
you know, Dave Chappelle was smoking some
[SPEAKER_02]: weed with fucking most deaf and,
and Taleb quality, most deaf and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, in common.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess they called it, they,
they, it was sold to them as like Maui
[SPEAKER_02]: Superdog and someone got so high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot who it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, nah, nigga, that's just
called the truth, the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was like this whole story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, that was just, you know,
and that was a story, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: motherfuckers were also talking about when
the truth seeds were in Mendo,
[SPEAKER_02]: the truth seeds were the first fucking
seeds I ever heard that were $80 a seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they went for $80 a pack,
but my, our partner Sean at the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: who's no longer with us, bless your soul.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he passed away from cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was one of the guys that came with the
Mendo, I mean my first years.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came into the fucking house after going
to a club in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, you want to fucking
believe this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he was a seed collector too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was our thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We collect clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd collect seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd go to any club.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could find clones of seeds and just go
shopping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, he came back with these fucking
truth seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, and he, and he didn't pop
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, bro, I paid 80 bucks a seed
for these.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, bro, I mean, seeds are
amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, it's like some of the best
flower you've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had some samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it was probably like 2010 when,
when I saw those seeds and then fast
[SPEAKER_02]: forward to like 2013, when I won the cup,
I didn't know who had bred the Raukush.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I didn't claim that I bred it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mandelbrot Shiloh comes up to the
booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin's also at the booth too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, Shiloh's with his fucking
big dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, Hey, this is Mandelbrot.
[SPEAKER_02]: He bred the Raukush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I was like, holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause when I went to go find the seeds of
the Raukush, they were, they were at this,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, they were at loving, loving it at a
dispensary in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the only dispensary in the
entire state of California that had
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking Emerald mountain seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were all the original seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were all the original release seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember buying tons of packs and we
selected the, the winning Royal sour out
[SPEAKER_02]: of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how the Royal sour name came about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a Fino from the Raukush seven
packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was hella sour D dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was long, long lanky spaghetti,
noodle stems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody that grows Royal knows it's like a
fucking pine tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's short, stout, fat, you know,
grows like a Christmas tree, but this one
[SPEAKER_02]: was like a sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was the one we entered.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember the seeds were old and they
had really bad germ rates on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after I met, uh, Mandelbrot,
he was like, yeah, dude, those are the
[SPEAKER_02]: original, you know, seeds, those original
Raukush seven seeds I made.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I remember after that, you know,
we became, you know, he, we became friends
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, he sold me several hundred
seeds of, you know, the truth,
[SPEAKER_02]: the original truth, which I, you know,
some of them I still have and the Royals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my goal was like, I was like,
look, man, I'm making this Royal and it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's, I want to acclimatize it to
the Mendo environment, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: because what we were doing is,
you know, the Royal Kush was really
[SPEAKER_02]: unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was you'd get a fucking nice, you know,
huge fucking crazy frosty plant that had
[SPEAKER_02]: gas, but no powdery, no mold, you know,
and Leightonville is a really unique
[SPEAKER_02]: environment as far as Mendocino is
concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as dry as places like,
like Boonville.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as dry as places in, you know,
uh, East Willets, like at Hearst,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, Leightonville definitely has a
lot more coastal influence, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little more fog.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the whole goal of doing the Long Valley
Royal Kush was to select a Royal Kush from
[SPEAKER_02]: seed that was relatively consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody remembers popping the original
Royal Kush seven seeds from rot,
[SPEAKER_02]: every single female was, was crazy
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like not in a bad way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every female was fucking fire,
but you know, some would be long,
[SPEAKER_02]: some would be short, some would be purple,
some would have gas, some wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we wanted to get a strain that I
selected the Sour D dominant female and
[SPEAKER_02]: the Sour D dominant female.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so because we felt that the Sour D
tendency, Sour D did really well in
[SPEAKER_02]: Leightonville.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, uh, old faithful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could grow a ton of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't have a lot of powdery.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't have a lot of botrytis and you
could get it to market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, just from that observation,
I wanted to select, you know, more of
[SPEAKER_02]: these smaller leaves, noodly branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's trace that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're definitive of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and then when I started
working his lines more that when,
[SPEAKER_02]: when Mandelbrot sold me, um, those
original seeds, that was, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that was where we really made the fucking
Royal Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he helped me select and, you know,
um, you know, I was giving him plants up
[SPEAKER_02]: until, you know, when he passed away 2015,
you know, it was fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I gave him, actually gave him
the last of my plants in my greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he had a, he had a problem on his
farms, a bunch of his plants died.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember, you know, I was still with
Lady L at the time and Mandelbrot comes
[SPEAKER_02]: with his truck and we just gave him like a
few hundred.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of our plants that we had left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was all his genetics too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, happy to give them to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, bro, you like, you know,
you helped me, you know, create these and,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not create these, but you helped
me like fucking grow these out and select
[SPEAKER_02]: these fine, you know, what was fire,
you know, it was like the best thing I
[SPEAKER_02]: could at least do is give you these,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what was cool about Mandelbrot was he
operated, he vibrated at such a high
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking level, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he got me my first account at,
uh, Ag Unlimited.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I'm still on his account.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a Mac, I'm still on his account.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was before I even knew his real name,
I'd come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yo, Mandelbrot here sent me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, who are you, Mac?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was kind of like, yeah, whatever
that guy, big guy, you know, the guy I
[SPEAKER_02]: came in with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he sent my first, um, like real Ag
account up at a Ag wholesaler.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the time I was super into,
um, soil science.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was super into compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have just previously worked with
Alan Atkinson from Gokashi.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was doing Probiotic Farmers Alliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was something that we really
connected on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mandelbrot was doing Emerald Mountain
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was formulating soil for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was actually mixing his own nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was buying, he was getting BioLink
nutrients and he was mixing them and
[SPEAKER_02]: having Ag Unlimited do custom mixes for
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he would find his own inputs
around the, so like really my regimen I
[SPEAKER_02]: gave to my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I won the cup through the
regimen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I built with, you know, that I learned
from Mike and that I helped, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, cause the cup soil recipe was
jointly created by, um, by, by Lady L and
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, her cousin, Crazy Larry had
this crazy fire soil mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was, you know, I did all the
top end fertilization and the chain
[SPEAKER_02]: selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it came to fertilizing,
Mandelbrot had an incredible talent for
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where we really bonded on,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember we would be at Areo 101
with Emerald Cup Tim.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the time there was, I was there,
Mandelbrot was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Casey O'Neill might've been there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this guy named this PhD plant
pathologist named Chuck Schiller,
[SPEAKER_02]: who invented the micronized 12-0-0,
the 12-0-0 soybean powder that a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people are using as a foliar.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He invented that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, he was kind of like him and
Han, a lot of his growers, but he was
[SPEAKER_02]: genuinely blown the fuck away by
Mandelbrot's knowledge of soil sciences
[SPEAKER_02]: and general botany and horticulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was blown the fuck away.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy's knowledge was so, um,
you know, and I think that was probably
[SPEAKER_02]: like a year before, you know, he passed
away was when, you know, they called us
[SPEAKER_02]: in, you know, the whole, the whole thing
it was, is Chuck Schiller is working for
[SPEAKER_02]: Grower's Secret at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Grower's Secret was like, well,
we're trying to formulate the best,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, bloom formula possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so like, you know,
me and Mandelbrot, we were really geeking
[SPEAKER_02]: out on that because we had a beef with
BioLynx, you know, phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, because their phosphorus was
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had this great phosphorus nutrient,
but it was a colloidal phosphate
[SPEAKER_02]: suspension.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically it was just fucking water and
soft rock phosphate, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was, you know, and so what we
wanted was we wanted something kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like what BioKana had, but they had an
exclusive license on it was like this
[SPEAKER_02]: colloidal phosphate based phosphorus bloom
formula, but that didn't have any sediment
[SPEAKER_02]: that you can run through a drip line,
you know, because Mandelbrot was really
[SPEAKER_02]: big on, all right, I want to breed these
genetics, but I also want to create the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil and the nutrient, you know,
nutrient regimen for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also want it to be scalable and I
want it to be universal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anybody can use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like really working with
Mandelbrot goes way past the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dude taught me so much about fucking
general, you know, general nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have a file box full of like the
old catalogs from Emerald Mountain
[SPEAKER_02]: Organics of what, what, what the soil
mixes Mandelbrot would make for people and
[SPEAKER_02]: the different regimens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he had a 32 part, no 18 part liquid,
organic liquid regimen, and it wasn't for
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding the plant, it was for feeding the
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he was on to some next level shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mandelbrot was the first person using a
calcium magnesium, using a cow mag that
[SPEAKER_02]: was completely organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all from mined car magnesium
carbonate and calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this company, that was working with
spinach farmers back in the late nineties,
[SPEAKER_02]: they found out that they could take this
calcium carbonate and this magnesium
[SPEAKER_02]: carbonate and they could put in a vat of
what's called dextro lactic acid,
[SPEAKER_02]: dextro lactic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a, it's a different salt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different sugar based or sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm saying the right thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sugar based lactic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what it does is it attaches a sugar
molecule to the calcium and the magnesium
[SPEAKER_02]: components and the magnesium calcium
carbonate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it allows it to just hang out in the
soil as, as an amino acid based calcium
[SPEAKER_02]: magnesium.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so what was crazy about this is
like whenever you generally feed cow mag
[SPEAKER_02]: to a plant, it's chelated with,
with, with, with, with EDTA, which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: chemical salt chelating agent,
and it gets directly absorbed by the
[SPEAKER_02]: roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what Mandelbrot was doing,
he was like, fuck, how do I, how do I
[SPEAKER_02]: increase the mobile availability of
calcium and magnesium?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, so will we know that magnesium is
mobile in soil, but calcium, it isn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with through, but through doing his
fucking homework, he was the first person
[SPEAKER_02]: to use cow mag DL on crops, on like
cannabis crops like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was like, you know, like when,
when he taught me these things and I
[SPEAKER_02]: switched to using his inputs, man,
my fuck a soil went through the roof.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the first time dirty business
soil came online and I was actually able
[SPEAKER_02]: to see what my cation exchange capacity
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what people understand, they're
listening, what a cation exchange capacity
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically a number that indicates,
um, the rate of how, uh, how available
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients are in your soil and the
breakdown of nutrients in your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I was getting way higher numbers,
like with the soil that was using
[SPEAKER_02]: Mandelbrot's inputs versus the soils that
weren't, you know, so it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it goes way more than genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: How I grow completely changed because of
him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for real as well as a lot to take
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to, I'm trying to think about a
lot of people don't know the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was a, it was a really,
it was something that it was always,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was street business back in the day,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was, that was something that,
you know, no matter what, even though that
[SPEAKER_02]: there was drama between Mandelbrot's
brother and I back in the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was something that, you know,
it wasn't my business to share.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it wasn't, it wasn't me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when people were doubting that when I
worked with Mandelbrot, it wasn't up for
[SPEAKER_02]: me to reinforce that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I knew what the fuck I did with
Mandelbrot and the right people knew what
[SPEAKER_02]: did Mandelbrot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was sitting with him in an area
one-on-one helping formulate fucking bloom
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients with Chuck Schiller from
Grower's Secret.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chuck Schiller remembers that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like, it's a, it was like a,
it was a, it was a bittersweet,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, cause I had some drama with,
with his family back, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like two years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a really hard thing to deal
with, you know, cause I had never met his
[SPEAKER_02]: family.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a, we had a strictly, it was old
school relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: We were based on the hustle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, people that usually
are fucking doing deals together.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to family barbecues
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you guys grew up together,
you know, and I'm a transplant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really didn't get to meet most of
Mandelbrot's family until I feel like he
[SPEAKER_02]: really passed away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's unfortunate to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, but he was probably,
you know, he's the whole point of working
[SPEAKER_02]: his lines, especially after he passed away
was, was so his memory wouldn't die.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that a lot of people, you know,
me and Mandelbrot would talk about this
[SPEAKER_02]: thing about the great breeders that would
breed something and their shit got raided
[SPEAKER_02]: by the cops or they got killed,
you know, and no one's ever going to hear
[SPEAKER_02]: that story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and, and that shit's in,
in those genetics are forever going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: extinct.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it was about, you know,
I felt that this guy was like the father
[SPEAKER_02]: of the contemporary, you know,
of what he made breeding fuel possible for
[SPEAKER_02]: a larger, for a larger audience that
didn't have access to things like
[SPEAKER_02]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was like, I'd be damned if,
if, if, if all fuckers forgot about them,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But now his memory lives on through,
you know, numerous farms and Ben still
[SPEAKER_02]: can, you know, Ben still continuing,
you know, his brother's work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, that's the beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what type of legacy do you want to
leave on?
[SPEAKER_04]: The industry from aficionado?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want, I want to build something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to build a company that stand the
test of time, you know, and I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: about, you know, finding, finding
different talents that could help you take
[SPEAKER_02]: this vision and take it somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like you'd look at, like I studied a
lot of fashion companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up in, I grew up in, you know,
Yokohama and, you know, I studied fashion
[SPEAKER_02]: when I was in college in Japan before I,
before I moved back to the States.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've always been fascinated by how
a lot of these luxury companies were
[SPEAKER_02]: built.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of how these fashion companies are
built.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you look at, you know, long after
Christian Dior passed away, he had this
[SPEAKER_02]: guy named John Galliano, you know,
being his creative designer, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so you could have like, you know,
after, if the brand's good enough and it
[SPEAKER_02]: could live, it could continue to live on,
it's still going to need some sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: creative director to carry that legacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to just sell aficionado.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to do this for the rest of my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want, I want, I want my grandkids to,
to be able to, to sit at the board of
[SPEAKER_02]: aficionados table and work with whoever
they choose to be the creative director or
[SPEAKER_02]: whoever is good enough to breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like with, you know, Yves Saint
Laurent, that's where I was how Tom Ford
[SPEAKER_02]: was the creative director of Yves Saint
Laurent and Gucci.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all these companies were started by a
guy named fucking Yves Saint Laurent and a
[SPEAKER_02]: guy whose last name was Gucci.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like my, my, my vision was like,
I mean, if we, if I could really,
[SPEAKER_02]: if there's a possibility we could build
something that's stand the test of time,
[SPEAKER_02]: that will still be here after we die,
what, what's needed to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so I guess we're exploring
that right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know Frenchie's exploring that right
now, you know, cause for Frenchie's
[SPEAKER_02]: building is, is a brand that, that we want
to, to stand the test of time too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Jack Daniels is going to make
the whiskey forever, but he's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to stand the test of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's really early in the industry
and it's going to only time in the market
[SPEAKER_02]: and consistency is going to decide who
reaches that level first, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause I don't think anyone's reached that
level yet, but I think it's worth trying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, if we're talking means to an
end there, what are you going to release
[SPEAKER_04]: next?
[SPEAKER_04]: What can people look forward to next and
tell us what you're going to have at
[SPEAKER_04]: Emerald?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're, so Emerald Mountain,
Emerald Cup, our distributor seeds here
[SPEAKER_02]: now is going to be representing a fish and
all the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be doing some appearances there,
but due to regulation, we weren't able to
[SPEAKER_02]: get all the right permits in time for the
Emerald Cup this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So James is going to handle the launch for
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also going to be doing an online
pre-sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've never done a launch online for the
Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always like people have always had to
wait after the Emerald Cup for things to
[SPEAKER_02]: be available on seeds here now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're doing something different is
since our market has magically grown
[SPEAKER_02]: global over the last two years,
we're going to offer, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: special online pre-Emerald Cup release.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people that are fans and have always
supported us, they could, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they have the opportunity to cop what's
going to be at the Emerald Cup too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody has the opportunity to cop it
now, but there's not going to be a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we, we, we, we did a 2000 plant
sift this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We worked a lot of strains that we worked
last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ended up only keeping 80 plants out of
the 2000 and we only pollinated 13,
[SPEAKER_02]: 13 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different, we used some different males on
some different plants, but our production,
[SPEAKER_02]: like that's what we made.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so five, five to five of those 13 will
probably make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fruit tartar turned out really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The forbidden fruit in the pines,
cross forbidden fruit magnum opus,
[SPEAKER_02]: that turned out hella good releasing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We released six boxes of the F1,
of formula one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those auctioned for obscene amounts of
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: We never thought they would auction for so
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the fact that there had,
there was only six boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used some good shit on them too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It went for a huge price, but we wanted
people, we liked it so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, man, it just can't be six
people in fucking boxes of formula one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to release F2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were pretty happy with how the F2,
you know, how the F2 is turning out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really excited with how the F1
turned out in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the Citroen Flambé,
which is the Sangria times Cherry Noir
[SPEAKER_02]: times Testerosa.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one that we're really excited
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a few that still waiting to be
named.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just can't find the perfect name for
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're going to be releasing an OG
Cross this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a collab with the guy who brought me
up to Mendoz.
[SPEAKER_02]: His name is Mendocino Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we bred his, he has this OG called,
we called the Greenbomb OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: His name is Mike Greenbomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we called the Greenbomb OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that is, it's heirloom bubblegum
crossed with an SFV OG that he had from
[SPEAKER_02]: Seed that he's been making himself for the
last four years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he crossed that with the old school
bubblegum and he got this bubblegum framed
[SPEAKER_02]: plant that turns purple, but still
somewhat smells like OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you get this fruity bubblegum,
but it's, there's just as much OG on the
[SPEAKER_02]: contrast in the butt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we crossed that with our Versailles
OG, which was like a really good solid OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're releasing that year and we're
calling, that's going to be, we're
[SPEAKER_02]: releasing the Miyazaki OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're calling that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's from my old Japan roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Miyazaki was a director who created films
such as Totoro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we always called Mike Totoro because
he was like a mountain, he's like a forest
[SPEAKER_02]: spirit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like this guy's, he's like late
fifties, huge white beard, tatted foot,
[SPEAKER_02]: from head to toe walks barefoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a fucking mountain spirit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this guy's a forest spirit,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and he taught me a lot about,
you know, paying respect to plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: appreciating nature the way that
Miyazaki's films did for me when I was
[SPEAKER_02]: growing up as a kid in Japan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we chose to name that, that strain
Miyazaki OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next two, we just haven't named
yet, but they're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we came across a flavor and the
backyard in BCN got some of these seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leo got some of these seeds and it's
working title was Rosso Corsa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was this offshoot from the
TestaRosa line we were working when we
[SPEAKER_02]: crossed it with the Cherry Noir.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rosso Corsa is the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't going to brand it this way
because that's, Ferrari has that name
[SPEAKER_02]: trademarked as the color of the paint on
their cars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was just like, I just called it that
just as remember that it was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, that's obviously from my TestaRosa
cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause the number, the color red on the
TestaRosa was called Rosso Corsa.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're going through this thing where
we're trying to find a good identity for
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it doesn't smell like anything we've
ever worked before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a completely, it literally smells
like if you were trick or treating and you
[SPEAKER_02]: had a roll of Smarties in your pocket get
crushed up and then somehow someone
[SPEAKER_02]: spilled gasoline.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've never been able, we never thought
we'd be able to get turps like this to
[SPEAKER_02]: express.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted something that we could call
it that would give it its justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And two, we wouldn't get a cease and
desist from Ferrari.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause TestaRosa is like Italian for
redhead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like a lot of the stems and the
leaves and the TestaRosa would get this
[SPEAKER_02]: red hue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we called it the TestaRosa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Rosso Corsa was even more fucking
red.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just this brilliant, vibrant red
that would transition to a lavender and
[SPEAKER_02]: then like a royal purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, but the nose was just pure candy
shop, pure candy shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll call it a candy shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds, it sounds really exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a question though for you and you
got to be honest here.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you do the online launch,
do you expect the site to crash?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the coolest thing that happened to
Seeds here now is we crashed their servers
[SPEAKER_02]: one time where the orders came in so fast,
they actually oversold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because the computers couldn't keep up
with them with the frequency of orders
[SPEAKER_02]: going out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was like, you know, we never
expect these kinds of things to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, we're really grateful and we're
humbled, you know, cause we really
[SPEAKER_02]: approach this like as music, you know,
we could, you know, if we're in,
[SPEAKER_02]: if we're in the garden, you know,
ours, our version of a studio,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a really good chance what we,
what we make won't connect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, if it connects on the front
end and people like the cross and they
[SPEAKER_02]: like the way it sounds, and then it really
expresses itself to exceed their
[SPEAKER_02]: expectations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we'll know, you know,
our job is done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, it's really hard for us to
get excited over sales because the sales
[SPEAKER_02]: is the first part of that, that,
that relationship with the grower,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, who's, who's the cornerstone of
your fucking brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to get his validation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a good day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a good day when you sell the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a scary day when you sell the seeds,
cause you better fucking hope those seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: come out good for that grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when, when you get the feedback months
later, that's when you know, you could,
[SPEAKER_02]: you could rest easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause your testing could be on point and
your friend's gardens that you're testing
[SPEAKER_02]: other strains too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we tested our other strains in Mendo
this year and they did, they did good as
[SPEAKER_02]: usual.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause Mendo is where we're from.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know it's going to test good,
but is he going to hold up in other
[SPEAKER_02]: people's grouse?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to express yourselves to you
according to your expectations and their
[SPEAKER_02]: expectations in their environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's the key.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try not to get too excited about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think if you get excited about
selling seeds, you're in it for the wrong
[SPEAKER_02]: purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, you know, um, you know,
if you're getting excited too early and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then, you know, you just can't
forecast the fucking future.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: If we could all forecast the future,
we wouldn't be in the weed game.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd be running headphones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess that's the fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the testing in the world could be
good, but if it doesn't prove itself on
[SPEAKER_02]: the market, you're fucked.
[SPEAKER_04]: So bringing us to kind of the tail end of
things, a really interesting question I
[SPEAKER_04]: posed to a lot of people, it doesn't seem
to be a very clear answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your recommendations for the small
scale farmers, both indoor and out,
[SPEAKER_04]: who are kind of continually dealing with
this conundrum of ever decreasing prices
[SPEAKER_04]: and ever increasing supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really difficult problem,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the regulations are changing
almost daily, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When people adapt to a certain set of
circumstances, the circumstances change
[SPEAKER_02]: yet again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a longterm thinker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's really painful for a lot of
people that, that, that are in the rec
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as profitable, but it used to be,
you got to pay every fucking tax under the
[SPEAKER_02]: moon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you know, things are getting
spread out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regulation makes it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, definitely, like I said
before, we're not making as much money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm speaking in the sense of long
speaking in light of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: of a longterm scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: If, if, if, if they could just hold on,
hold on for another two to four years,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, keep grinding as hard as you fucking
can for two to four years, because
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada's already made cannabis
international and the amount of fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: money that government is going to,
cannabis is going to dramatically improve
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada's GDP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And America is not going to sit back and
watch this happen for too much longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people, a lot of people agree
with the sentiment in Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still talk to a lot of my old
colleagues back in Washington that are
[SPEAKER_02]: still doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, Hey, let's talk right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you think politics are going?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and then I'll kind of get a feel
for things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that whether you want to fucking
acknowledge it or not, cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: international right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people, these small farmers have to
embrace the future and just hold the fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: on because once this goes international,
these small farms are on them are
[SPEAKER_02]: overnight going to be big or are going to
be the next big napple wineries.
[SPEAKER_02]: All their products going to fucking sell
out over and over and over and over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smart ones are going to fuck a scale
immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're going to, they're going
to, you know, California right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: California weed is all over the fucking
planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go on Instagram, you go on
different feeds in the UK, you want
[SPEAKER_02]: different feeds in Spain, just the fact of
the matter is there's, there's,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's California branded weed everywhere
and it's going for a premium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, so a lot of people
have to understand when we were,
[SPEAKER_02]: when we were breeding, we like to read
what the black market is doing and see
[SPEAKER_02]: what trends in the black market are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the most, one of the most demanding
markets as far as taste and flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're just dealing with people that,
that buy things at the highest ticket
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like, what the black market is
doing, you know, worldwide, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're seeing a lot of, you know,
somehow a lot of these packs from Cali
[SPEAKER_02]: are, are, are, are going worldwide,
but they're going for huge premiums.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that should be indicated to everybody
that when this fucking switch flips guys,
[SPEAKER_02]: when this switch flips, everyone's going
to have it made that, that, that
[SPEAKER_02]: sacrificed everything that put their
fucking Dick on the line, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: put everything on the line, their
families, their wellbeing to just keep
[SPEAKER_02]: doing this dream of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of stopped looking at just the
Cali thing, even though it's the Cali
[SPEAKER_02]: thing for right now, cause it's not always
going to be like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The world's global and the market dynamics
are going to change big time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing we don't, it's not going to
change is that consistently the best
[SPEAKER_02]: quality is going to keep continue to come
out of California hands down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just our culture, what we're known
for.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it starts telling me you're at the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just hold on guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe in everybody, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like our shit was so fire for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was going back east for a, for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and who else knows where it was
going?
[SPEAKER_02]: But when, what's we know right now,
if you, if you just surf on Instagram a
[SPEAKER_02]: little hard, you see Cali weed in
different places in Europe, it happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a whole import category at clubs
in Amsterdam, import weed, get the fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, come on guys, that's the
highest price point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, people need to start
accepting that our fate as California for
[SPEAKER_02]: the large part, if you're raw at your
fucking game, man, it's going to be like
[SPEAKER_02]: wine or your shit's going to go for
extremely high premiums.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, because of your location and two,
because you got roots in the game and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're able to back that up with your
quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, if you got a farm and you're
holding on right now, just keep fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: holding on guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, you're going to do way
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you guys are going to be the
magic makers that connect with everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Breeders can only connect with so many
people, but growers connect with
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the true artists.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do you think is the best way to
deal with the dichotomy of you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: needing to use Instagram or social media
in general as a breeder to promote your
[SPEAKER_04]: brand, but also, you know, trying to stay
off that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if anybody doesn't think it's
necessary, you're crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your shit better be so fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other people just naturally post pictures
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the world's changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: How we interface with people has changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before it was on threads and it was on
forums, it was on ICMAG, it was on the
[SPEAKER_02]: hustle, but now Instagram has changed the
game.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're so more connected than we've ever
been.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are able to show their grow
methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've seen a huge exponential
increase in raw growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: People, a lot of people, a lot of hobbyist
growers, people just starting out,
[SPEAKER_02]: people just in the Instagram are growing
some good shit because they're watching
[SPEAKER_02]: all these pros on Instagram, sharing their
knowledge, man, sharing the tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, you know, quality,
you know, quality is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: continuing to go up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because the phenomenon on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more people globally have been able to
discover aficionado through IG than we
[SPEAKER_02]: ever have been, you know, being in
magazines, you know, being in,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, being a skunk, you know,
and being a high times, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, being a high times is big for us,
but consistently when you have a platform
[SPEAKER_02]: that reaches everybody in the world and
everyone network, you know, overlaps to
[SPEAKER_02]: these over worldwide networks,
it creates a reach that we never been able
[SPEAKER_02]: to see before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, I think everyone's still
adjusting to this new culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of IG, it's absolutely necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's fucked up with people,
get their accounts deleted because their
[SPEAKER_02]: livelihoods, their followings are
dependent on, on, on their IG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, a lot of people's
success is measured upon their followers
[SPEAKER_02]: because people think there's a corollary
between your followers and your
[SPEAKER_02]: consistency as being someone who's a
supplier of quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but perception is reality and this is
how people communicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can't ignore reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to be real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right now it's on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes down to DM.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just onto the final little last few
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the more short response ones,
generally speaking.
[SPEAKER_04]: First one, it's a bit of a lesser ass one,
but I have a feeling you have a good
[SPEAKER_04]: answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your favorite Tom Hill strain
besides Deep Chunk?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Deep Chunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but that's why I said it was Deep
Chunk because I heard stories about him on
[SPEAKER_02]: Spyrock having the balls to select their
3000 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like nobody was doing that when Tom Hill
was doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking nobody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the fact that he was able to get
the old blue Hindu and the old red Hindu.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people in town, Leightonville can
actually trace back who the fuck brought
[SPEAKER_02]: the Hindu back to Leightonville.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's not my business to
make, you know, who these people are
[SPEAKER_02]: public knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: But definitely, you know, Jackson knows
these people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and Gene knows these people for a
hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, these are the people that
originally brought Hindu Kush back to
[SPEAKER_02]: Spyrock in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like when Tom Hill was working it
in the 90s, early 2000s, nobody was doing
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody was putting their balls in the
line, selecting like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was just the whole mystique of him
having him, him being so devoted to his
[SPEAKER_02]: craft, he's willing to blow it up that
much, not to sell the flower, but to
[SPEAKER_02]: select a fucking seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he was crazy back in the day to not
use that shit and to sell all that flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was selecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: For like the best possible shit,
like that's passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like for that one,
like he went through that sacrifice to
[SPEAKER_02]: make Deep Chunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, that's my, that's my backup why Deep
Chunk's my favorite of his.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the folklore behind that too,
that really attracted me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, it's a good story and is a fan
favorite.
[SPEAKER_04]: So next one, what strain do you wish you
had back?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one did I fucking get rid of?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one have I lost?
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost my original G-13 cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got lost in a raid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was at a buddy's place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a G-13 cross Panama.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't anything that was super special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was something that was special to me in
the terms that it, one, it harvested late
[SPEAKER_02]: as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It harvested like second week in November,
but it didn't get any mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had the craziest high, the craziest
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the one I really regret losing is the,
really the bulk of my white cashmere
[SPEAKER_02]: seats.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was one of the strains that I
really could have opened up a lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really could have explored that one a
lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, there's a few others that
I've let kind of go out of the window and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, fuck, I shouldn't have sold all
those, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it was, to me, I want, to me it was
a person personal thing that if I really
[SPEAKER_02]: felt my work was good enough, I let it all
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'd say like a little bit,
but I wanted to see really where I stood.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, would it come back to me when
people keep working it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if people didn't work it, then
obviously it wasn't, it didn't meet my
[SPEAKER_02]: expectations for, for what could be a
classic, you know, cause it, cause people
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't inclined to keep working it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was things like that where I
released really small numbers of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People didn't work it because I felt like
I could have done better at the breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is the most memorable or the best
strain you've ever smoked?
[SPEAKER_02]: Big sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2012, we were at the cannabis cup in
Richmond.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was with Frenchie.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first cup I met Bam when Bam
was still working with coastal seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I met Mike from coastal seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had always read about the big sir,
holy weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like dying to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was almost the Tiva guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was dabbing all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like when dabs and shatter came
out, you know, it was 2012, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were, we were, we were getting
fucked up, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were dabbing like crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think I'd get any higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike pulls out this joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I meet Mike from coastal seeds through our
friend, Johnny Q and who Johnny Q runs
[SPEAKER_02]: Stanky Dink.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's also an Emerald cup winner from 2011,
2010.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and fucking he, we liked this big
sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it cuts clear through all the dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was almost like the C five haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the, the closest thing to C five haze
for me, as far as like intensity of
[SPEAKER_02]: cerebral high was, was Mike's big sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit was fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, it cut through all those
dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were smoking OG, you know, BAMF was big
at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were smoking a lot of his fucking lemon
OG hash, which was really strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I had a kick, man, but that
fucking big story, that was probably
[SPEAKER_02]: easily the most met that and, and this
too, this too, when I won the cup in 2012,
[SPEAKER_02]: Derek Emerald gave me some flowers of his
in the pines and Derek Emerald had won
[SPEAKER_02]: five Emerald cups previous, you know,
to me winning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, I think he's probably one of
the absolute, but he's, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_02]: the absolute best grower to ever compete
in the Emerald cup circus, Derek Emerald.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I smoked his flowers,
I think, I think, you know, on point with
[SPEAKER_02]: how blown away I was with, with Mike's
flowers, that was really memorable as far
[SPEAKER_02]: as like, holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's big sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exceeded all expectations as
incredible, but Derek Emerald's flowers in
[SPEAKER_02]: the, in the pines he gave me that year was
the absolute best flower I've ever fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could taste, taste the fucking love
that he put into it, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think also the first time I met
him, the first time I met, I met Mean
[SPEAKER_02]: Gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first time I met Mean Gene was
at the Peg house in Leggett.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I meet him online.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's telling me he has some crazy shit and
he says, Hey, come out to this reggae
[SPEAKER_02]: show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be performing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, fuck you, you do reggae?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like out there, I haven't met him
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm waiting to meet Jackson at the Peg
house and we, we, we see our, our homie.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like this, you know, this OG guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody from the neighborhood knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say, what's up, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out my weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I show him this weed of this bud
of something we selected from the can of
[SPEAKER_02]: tonic that we called La Dolce Vita.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like this 27% THC can of tonic is
fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I smell what, what homie's
smoking on, what Rick was smoking on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and it was like the craziest fucking
flavor I've ever smelled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, what the fuck are you
smoking?
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes on cherry, cherry, cherry crossed
line, cherry pie across line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, who grew that?
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like my boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wouldn't tell me who grew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he's a boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, I remember Jackson,
you know, Gene goes on stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does his thing, kills it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he's a really good performer.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't heard his music,
but he gets off stage and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro, you got to fucking try this weed,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, and then Rick's like,
oh, that's my boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the one who made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, you know, it was like,
bro, you know, if you would have entered
[SPEAKER_02]: that this year, you would have,
you would have fucking beat me like
[SPEAKER_02]: hardcore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it would have been landslide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, no, he was really humble
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, no, your fucking shit would have
won, bro, if you entered this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he ended up fucking getting a
breeder's cup of cherry lime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a few years later, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like, that was like,
so those three experiences, Derek Emerald,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike from Coastal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the first time I met me,
Gene in 2012, at the Peg House,
[SPEAKER_02]: that was like the most memorable pod
experiences I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and then one more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to share one more, one more,
cause it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first day I get to Mendo, I'm at
Mountain Mike's house and we had,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're fresh from San Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had just closed the club down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sheriffs had shut the club down and,
but Mike had some weed that was hanging in
[SPEAKER_02]: the house for like literally six fucking
months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the whole time he was like,
he was Mike when I was running the club in
[SPEAKER_02]: San Diego with Mike, he was back and
forth, you know, going from Mendo to San
[SPEAKER_02]: Diego all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, when we finally had the club
shut down, we were there, he had his weed
[SPEAKER_02]: that was hanging there for six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was original Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the first time I had the
realest Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was, that was probably some of
the highest, probably the, some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: happiest high weed I've ever smoked in my
life was, was that original Urkel that
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike had just sitting there after months
and months and months and months.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never tasted a flake.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never liked that, you know, his house
was like in the trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was in this place in the stairs
where his house was wood and there was
[SPEAKER_02]: like the perfect, it was always cool and
cold and there was always the right
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just cured perfectly after these
last six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, that was like, it was my
first time in Mendo and my first time
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking Mendo weed was like, you know,
that Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess, you know, those four
experiences were like definitive to me,
[SPEAKER_02]: which, which changed how I looked at weed
and how I approached that weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single one of those experiences,
pushed me to want to get to that level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, wow, that level exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I have to do to just get on that
level?
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of concentration do I need to
have?
[SPEAKER_02]: What discipline do I need to have to
express myself in the way these guys are
[SPEAKER_02]: expressing themselves?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it came like that for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What an awesome little backstory.
[SPEAKER_04]: So onto our third last question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Polar opposite of the best one.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the worst weed strand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Berry white.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great plant to grow, but it's got,
it's just frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got no kick.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hash sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wants to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was definitely one strain
that I wasn't really a fan of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, um, I'm a big fan of weed,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, there's one strain of hate
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate growing Bubba, but I love smoking
that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this one thing I just hate smoking is
fucking, you know, some people say blue
[SPEAKER_02]: dream train wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like smoking all that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: When it's for some reason, I do not very
white.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll always have a little soft spot for
blue dream, I reckon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Onto the next question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So desert Island, top three weeds,
all you can smoke for the rest of your
[SPEAKER_04]: life.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn, he got me on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Original.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard to find the original
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody says they have it, but it's not
the real sour D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even when I was moving packs, one out of
20 pounds was a real sour D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any hustler agree with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Motherfucker's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's probably being nice too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but if you could, if I could find the,
you know, the original, just like that
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking crazy sour from back in the day,
that would just stink up your whole car.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bring that with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely bring chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem dog, sour and C five haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice little array.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so lucky last question, if you could
go back in time to anywhere, any place to
[SPEAKER_04]: get some land race seeds, presumably,
where would you go?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Marco Polo times in like Southeast
Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, before like Western
expansion, you know, cause with trade,
[SPEAKER_02]: he also saw the trade of certain cultivars
of plants that were being domesticated by
[SPEAKER_02]: people throughout, you know, uh,
you know, Europe and Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, you know, I always heard these
stories about, you know, my, my favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: weed generally since I was in Thailand as
a young kid, it was always been the Thai
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Burmese weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always wondered what weed was like
from those villages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they, they purposely cultivated
those flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certain parts of this area,
just for their flower, just for smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, whereas other places in the
region, in the world, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like India and Pakistan and Afghanistan,
there was, there was hash cultures and
[SPEAKER_02]: other places that were cultivating hemp
were cultivating it for fiber.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, uh, Southeast Asia was one
of those rare places where people,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and some parts of Africa too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't forget about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, you know, fuck Thailand,
Burma, 1800s before Western real,
[SPEAKER_02]: real Western and industrial, you know,
technocratic expansion happened where
[SPEAKER_02]: people were there, where their ancient way
of life was, um, wasn't allowed anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I wanted to, you might buy,
you know, if I had it, if I got to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: time machine would be like, what was,
what, what, if they were one of the only
[SPEAKER_02]: cultures on the fucking planet,
you know, breeding weed and selecting it
[SPEAKER_02]: for the taste and the high of the flower,
man, what the fuck were they smoking on
[SPEAKER_02]: before, you know, Western, for Western
ideas says that this isn't good for you
[SPEAKER_02]: and we have to outlaw that or even before
when, you know, you know, different
[SPEAKER_02]: change, dramatic changes happen in certain
countries where that culture is lost
[SPEAKER_02]: because the village is obliterated due to
war.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's also a factor too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah, I've got to, I got a thing
for those hazes for Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that might bring us to just
about the end of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have any comments or shout outs
you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, uh, dude, big shout out to professor
Q, you know, Quentin, man, big shout out
