[SPEAKER_01]: extraordinaire, meme master himself and
the guy who I like to think of as the Elon
[SPEAKER_01]: Musk of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mean Gene, thanks so much for joining us
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey man, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to have you back for a part two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our fans have been very excited for this
one to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing I want to ask you,
what are you currently smoking on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently smoking on, let's see right in
front of me, the latest stuff that I got,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is not really that late.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had it for sitting here for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a really cool LA confidential from
my friend who does Tyler at Buds and
[SPEAKER_02]: Roses.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave me some of this LA confidential.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said it was a nice run and it's kind of
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd always wondered.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard that they use this thing they call
the aphi to breed that and it was really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting to get it because it's
actually probably about the closest weed I
[SPEAKER_02]: can remember seeing to what we call black
aphi up here, which makes me wonder if
[SPEAKER_02]: there's any relation or if it's just that
it's that good kind of darker coffee
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghani type.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's pretty common in California
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of out of the ordinary
because it was a gift, but pretty stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's an interesting strain because
a lot of people talk about how that really
[SPEAKER_01]: special aphi mother you mentioned was
replaced in subsequent releases of the LA
[SPEAKER_01]: con with something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't suppose you'd ever tried the
subsequent releases that people weren't so
[SPEAKER_01]: impressed by.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one, I assume, just judging by what
it looks like, I assume is the original
[SPEAKER_02]: one, although I have really no ground to
stand on on that, except for saying that
[SPEAKER_02]: it really has an old, old Kali Afghani
look.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very similar to what I had that was
the Hindu cross black aphi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day that I made and the black
aphi itself was a little less resinous and
[SPEAKER_02]: then crossed with the Hindu kind of beefed
up the resin content.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was like pulling out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could have told me, oh, I had I kept
some of those seeds and I grew this out
[SPEAKER_02]: and I would have thought it was the same
Hindu cross black aphi.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of cool, but I don't
remember ever seeing anything from the
[SPEAKER_02]: later ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I know is the first time I saw LA
confidential was at a point that was 2007
[SPEAKER_02]: and 2007.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that would have been 2007.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I only remember because it was like
the first time I went to the Emerald Cup
[SPEAKER_02]: when it was still a little event.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was still at the area one on one
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my friend who has a company now called
giving tree genetics, which has really
[SPEAKER_02]: nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had it and he had just come back from
Amsterdam and he was like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got all the different stuff over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was one of the nice things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's called LA confidential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had never heard of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had never heard of DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had never we didn't really know
anything about any like seed company stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: other than like old Neville and seed bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he showed it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I remember about that particular
one was that it was like a really sweet,
[SPEAKER_02]: fruity OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, wow, this is this this is
fucking bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was really, really nice weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had grown he had brought the seeds
back and grown it himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's a really good grower from down
the road from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, kind of makes everything
shine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was like that was my first
experience with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I kind of expected something like
that when I saw this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to see how much it was like the
black AFI.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it kind of made me think like,
oh, so maybe that LA AFI was very similar
[SPEAKER_02]: to to the black AFI, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wow, that's a that's a cool little
rundown on it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something which has always piqued my
interest, especially when I hear the term
[SPEAKER_01]: LA AFI and black AFI in general,
it makes me wonder if this is the same
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of AFI which might have gone into the
creation of Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just at least whenever I hear Urkel,
I always think black AFI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that sort of what you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you feel like they're they're kind
of bit different, actually?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, the way genetics work,
it's really hard to be able to call that
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody like Inspector at CSI would have
a better idea of what's inside the gene
[SPEAKER_02]: pool because of because of us wanting that
because of selfing the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: What people I think don't know,
there's a there's a belief that a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people hold that if you take something and
you self it, you get a bunch more of the
[SPEAKER_02]: exact same plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reality is when you self
something, it's the most extreme version
[SPEAKER_02]: of an inbreeding you can do, which will
reveal anything recessive that can pop
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, show you also those those
those dominant things that are in that
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get a picture of what the parents
were.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you even get a picture of what the
grandparents were and the great
[SPEAKER_02]: grandparents, probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he might have a better idea,
but I've kind of seen what he posts from
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've grown crosses of it and inbred
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't seen anything that I would
say is anything like what the AFI was that
[SPEAKER_02]: I had, the black AFI, or what obviously is
the AFI that's in this L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: conf.
[SPEAKER_02]: It it has more sweetness and Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: The really, really impressive thing about
Urkel to me was it has a kind of a rose,
[SPEAKER_02]: a rose oil and a lime peel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And things I associate with like fruit,
fruit loops, Flintstones, vitamins,
[SPEAKER_02]: artificial flavor, candy, things and a
nice little dose of some skunk on it,
[SPEAKER_02]: which people don't think of it as.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you have really nice outdoor
Urkel, it gets this little bit of skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: over the top of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, that AFI that I had was more
of a more of a earth spice, licorice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the same deal with this L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: conf.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say, you know, that the that
the Urkel, I wouldn't be surprised if it
[SPEAKER_02]: has something that's Afghani in it,
because it's very short and stout and
[SPEAKER_02]: bushy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows sideways almost almost faster
than it wants to grow up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gets it gets nice big fat buds if
you grow it right, like an Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wouldn't be surprised if it has
something like that in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of, you know, this is on a tangent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I was about nine years old,
I went to leg it to this lady's house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was when this was when the movie
Willow was brand new.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I watched the movie Willow there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we were chilling there,
she pulled out some pounds of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was when I had only seen a little
bit of dried weed, really like and had any
[SPEAKER_02]: interest in it, because you're just at
that age where you're not just a little,
[SPEAKER_02]: little, little kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I looked at it and it was what she
called the purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was more of a red purple than a
blue purple or a black purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was purple from the inside out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had this particular sweet smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the first time I had ever
seen weed that was purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it had this impact in my head,
like, whoa, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's weed that's purple, because to me,
it was always like, oh, pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of smells like hippies burning
sage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's green.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I saw this and I went,
huh, it smells like sweetness and fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was really, really weird to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I remembered it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like probably the first weed I really
remember anything about as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: features, besides it being some green shit
in a bag, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in about 94 or 95, a lady who's a
really, really close friend of mine,
[SPEAKER_02]: who I consider like my aunt, who actually
moved up from Santa Cruz when my mom was
[SPEAKER_02]: pregnant with me in end of 79,
early 80.
[SPEAKER_02]: She moved up here and she had a place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I was a pro for freshman year,
I moved up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lived with my sister for a while and
then my sister moved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when she moved, I still wanted to stay
in school because I didn't want to go back
[SPEAKER_02]: to Sonoma where I'd been living for eighth
grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so she was cool enough to say,
hey, you can stay in my cabin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I stayed in her cabin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she and her neighbor were growing this
clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she showed me the weed and offered me
a little bit of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, oh, this is crazy purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go, is this, is this thing from
so-and-so and leg it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And she goes, yeah, I got it from the
neighbor over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, have you seen it before?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go, yeah, I remember it from years
ago when I was a little kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as I smell it, I get this
nostalgic smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she had it at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not only did I see it when I was really
little, but I saw it about five years,
[SPEAKER_02]: six years later, and it came from the same
lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like the same thing,
you know, but it was a friend,
[SPEAKER_02]: a friend, both of them are friends of my
mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now when I smell Urkel crosses,
cherry pie crosses, granddaddy crosses,
[SPEAKER_02]: things that are in the cherry pie,
things that are in the gelato,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's this common smell they all have,
even in a little bit of the purple in my
[SPEAKER_02]: pina.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that same thing, which I call the
smell leg it purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's where I originally saw it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from this one, from this one
particular lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm fairly convinced that whatever
that clone was, and I believe it was
[SPEAKER_02]: probably some kind of a killer Afghani
clone or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that clone was probably the mother
of everything that people now call like
[SPEAKER_02]: the perps smell, like granddaddy,
all that different stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only other stuff that I ever saw
different than that, that had a real name
[SPEAKER_02]: on it that would give you any idea of
origin was the purple, purple Nepal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know that that was
necessarily, that was really Nepalese
[SPEAKER_02]: weed, or if somebody just thought that
sounded exotic and slapped a name on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But long story short, I think because of
being having that knee jerk reaction of
[SPEAKER_02]: deja vu, when I smell these smells and
it's sending me back to when I was young
[SPEAKER_02]: like that, I think that that clone was
probably where all these other purple
[SPEAKER_02]: things came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you look at that and you go,
it was already something in 89 being grown
[SPEAKER_02]: by several people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the time 95 came around,
it was still being grown a little ways
[SPEAKER_02]: down the road, not that far, but far
enough away from Leggett to Branscombe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had to have circulated quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw 94, 95, probably 95 for the last
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Urkel seems to have surfaced about 96
in Redway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I personally think there's some
connection there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tried to see if that clone was still
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the lady, I still see her sometimes in
the store and she runs a little business
[SPEAKER_02]: down the road, a little spa business,
probably not there anymore, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said that she gave it to one person in
Canada years ago and that he might still
[SPEAKER_02]: have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't ever really checked back in
on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really think that that was where all
that shit came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I couldn't tell you what that was.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is very different in that the aphi
is more of an acrid, sometimes has some
[SPEAKER_02]: garliciness to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more deep and licorice sometimes,
but not like Yeager or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it has like a resin where you
think it's not resinous, but then you
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke it and it chokes you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like it's coated in resin instead of
frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas this old perp thing and the Urkel
and all that, it has a more visibly,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know it's resinous when you look at
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't trick you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think those are kind of two things
that are parallel and unconnected just
[SPEAKER_02]: based on my experience with both jingles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a comprehensive sort of breakdown on
the Afghani lineage and purple strains in
[SPEAKER_01]: general.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's so many avenues we could
go off in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first question that kind of comes to
mind to me is that sometimes when we hear
[SPEAKER_01]: these stories, what kind of starts to pan
out from them is that rather than what I
[SPEAKER_01]: used to mistakenly believe in that we
started out with like these really shitty
[SPEAKER_01]: clones and just through miracle,
you get that one in a million and it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it gets a bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds almost like the opposite was
true in a way in that like the older stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: was possibly the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it was retained in quality
each generation, but sometimes it went
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you generally agree with that sort
of logic or how do you see it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, if you go to places,
you know, it's neat because you get to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of follow it a little bit with some
of the people now who share things like
[SPEAKER_02]: Deepak, what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Errazen, is that how you pronounce it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, Errazen.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you follow him around, you look and
you can watch people take these fields of
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that's hardly fed, hardly watered,
not really dried the way anybody,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, who are our contemporaries would
dry their head stash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the sun, you know, it's maybe
leaned up in a room, it's put in huge
[SPEAKER_02]: piles, it's passed through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you know anything about hash,
and you look at the resin that they
[SPEAKER_02]: produce in these piles, you go,
wow, that's actually really good fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the quality of cannabis comes from the
resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about whether or not you have a
flower that looks a certain way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you look at these places that are
traditional producing countries and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's been said for a long time
that they don't have anything anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: All they have is a bunch of bastardized
European remakes of other stuff that was
[SPEAKER_02]: given back to them and their gene pools
diluted.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know the old original Afghani types,
because when I saw them here, they were
[SPEAKER_02]: only had been bred maybe two or three
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if they had been hybridized with
newer stuff, those ones still pop out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look at stuff that he posts like
right now from Kandahar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, that is the same shit we're
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that is charity.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the things that people think
are so modern.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not really grown, like,
you know, I've grown things a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you just leave something,
you can have a clone of something that's
[SPEAKER_02]: exceptional.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you just kind of put it out there
and you barely water it, you barely feed
[SPEAKER_02]: it, then you're just like, yeah,
it is what it is, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to look like a crazy
Instagram picture of some fucking quote
[SPEAKER_02]: unquote Zaza, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can look at stuff he's posting
from Kandahar right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you go, dude, if you grew that indoor
or in a depth or just really took care of
[SPEAKER_02]: it and grew it outdoor, like you would be
looking at that and going, fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cherry pie or runs or gelato or all those
things that people are like, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: these modern things are bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, they honestly just seem like the
old shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: From back in the day to me, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was just talking to somebody
today or yesterday and they were talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about the old stuff that we had around
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And growing up, I always thought that it
was like so, so long ago, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause it's like, oh, it's 95 and they're
talking about 84, the import from 84 or 81
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, whoa, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the old school stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that I'm not 15 years old anymore,
I'm like, dude, that's fucking yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference in breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you import something in 84 and somebody
makes seeds two or three times,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you see it in the mid nineties,
like it's still the same fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to get that far doing
enough breedings just to make it be,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, fresh seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, in the back in the day,
people didn't just make every make seed
[SPEAKER_02]: every year and try to improve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, they got some killer Afghani or
Pakistani.
[SPEAKER_02]: They brought it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They seeded a whole plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grew them for a few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they went, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: We should probably make seed again this
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by the time you're seeing stuff,
it's only been displaced through three or
[SPEAKER_02]: four breedings at the most from 84 to 95.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my own opinion of how all that plays
out is that some people in basically from
[SPEAKER_02]: the sixties, to the nineties, really to
the, to the early eighties got their hands
[SPEAKER_02]: on things that were already killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made more seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grew them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they selected the females a couple
of times that were a little better or
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe a lot better than the average.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden they have these
really, really knockout strains that today
[SPEAKER_02]: are what we consider everything that's
killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the same time, through all
those years, people took things and they
[SPEAKER_02]: bred them the other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where they had something that was really
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they turned it mediocre because
they thought, man, this is too stinky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't look crystal enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It, you know, it doesn't quite have the
right thing that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they bred away from what actually made
enjoyable killer weed in their pursuit to
[SPEAKER_02]: try to make what they thought was what
weed should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they had a weird idea of it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think there was two directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they started with killer stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: They started with bad stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people made the killer stuff more
killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people made the killer stuff less
killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people took the bad stuff and
thought they made it killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just was like, you know,
going in a weird direction because they
[SPEAKER_02]: had these strange ideas like, oh,
we need it to be stealth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we want it to look frosty, but they
didn't realize the resin was in the heads
[SPEAKER_02]: and not the fucking stocks of the,
of the, of the trichomes or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I mean, that's my take.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that what we call modern
cannabis is nearly as far displaced from
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional cannabis as people think it
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think there's a lot of places where
they had stuff and they were happy with
[SPEAKER_02]: what it was and they kept having it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was other places where they had
really crazy killer weed and they just
[SPEAKER_02]: kept it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And different people over the years,
um, wound up with these different,
[SPEAKER_02]: different things from different places.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people have the luck to get
something from Kandahar or to car or like
[SPEAKER_02]: different places where there was these
really good things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that Missouri, you know, Mazar or
other people, you know, got these other
[SPEAKER_02]: things that they went, oh, this is,
you know, Columbia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, yeah, that's not actually
the good Columbia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, you know, and then the name
stick and it leads people on all these
[SPEAKER_02]: goose chases for all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that all the best stuff,
is only a little bit different now than it
[SPEAKER_02]: was way back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you had the best stuff in 1983
and you pulled it out now, people would be
[SPEAKER_02]: like, oh yeah, that's just as good as the
best stuff is right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then recombining things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so say you find something like the
black Afi that doesn't look resinous,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's ultra potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you cross it with something that
looks very resinous and is ultra potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you add the potency from the one into
the one that actually produces more resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you have more of what was already
ultra potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's when you get something like
OG and sour and chem where, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you had, you had the luck of these
combinations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's what the modern stuff
really stepped it up to was going,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, well, you know, and I think that's
where the magic of breeding is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is going, okay, we have this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine if it doesn't look resinous,
but it'll knock you on your ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine if you could make that same resin
be produced in larger amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden it's like,
oh shit, you know, this is, this,
[SPEAKER_02]: this stuff's really crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's like a little level up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we did, but I don't think it's
what people think it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's, I think it's, uh,
overrated a lot as far as what,
[SPEAKER_02]: what modern people did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the, the Afghani people and people
in Pakistan, Thailand, Vietnam,
[SPEAKER_02]: and all these other places had already
made stuff that by today's standards would
[SPEAKER_02]: be really fucking good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, you know, people rediscover it in
these gene pools and they think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: different because they did it now as
opposed to then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, that's my take on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what a bunch of solid info there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, um, looking as we speak at the,
uh, eras and posts you talk about and God,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these plants look almost exactly
like cherry pie and cookie sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me think, are you excited or
interested in exploring some of this stock
[SPEAKER_01]: that Deepak's found?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you were, are there any of your own
lines that you would be interested in sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of melding together with some of these,
um, you know, land race Afghans?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm really interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've been looking at the stuff that
he's collecting right now in Kandahar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, it looks, it looks like really
what I've always been looking for when I
[SPEAKER_02]: was wondering, like, can you still get
real Afghani seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: And people would always say, no,
everything's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every, everything since after the Soviet
invasion is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all been brought in and everything's
everything's everything sucks now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm looking and you even look,
just using critical thinking, you look at
[SPEAKER_02]: these areas and you look at these people
and you go, so you think these,
[SPEAKER_02]: these people really have these thousands
of years of tradition of, of holding these
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then someone showed up with some
bullshit and all of a sudden all their
[SPEAKER_02]: shit just turned to shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you look at the weed and you go,
they didn't have anything to bring from
[SPEAKER_02]: Russia or Amsterdam that would have been
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to mention that even if they did,
if you're familiar with breeding with some
[SPEAKER_02]: of these types, these things are ultra
dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these Afghanis like these Afghanis
could just stomp on the outside genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: and turn themselves back into what they
were to start with anyway, because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're, that's how they behave in a gene
pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're like what I call the
bullies, you know, they just come in and
[SPEAKER_02]: they just bully everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, okay, go ahead, cross
something with deep chunk and see if you
[SPEAKER_02]: get something like what you crossed with,
you're going to have more deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that for a few years and you're just
going to be back to having it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, but I don't, I don't think that's
the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think it's the case that,
that there's a lot of people who were
[SPEAKER_02]: isolated there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that a lot of people who went
to try to rediscover the old stuff went to
[SPEAKER_02]: little markets and they got bullshit
tourist fucking seeds that weren't really
[SPEAKER_02]: what was the real deal with the real
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the real people are probably pretty
intimidating if you're, if you're not from
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're probably pretty hard to
approach and you have to have people who,
[SPEAKER_02]: who could really access the right people
and the right areas and, and get in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think it's really crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm really excited to dig back into
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have stuff from him and a couple
other people who have collected from over
[SPEAKER_02]: there, like land race legacy and Afghan
selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'm going to dig in there
and see what's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm also excited about some of the
other stuff that Deepak did, which is like
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the stuff, like the, you know,
there's, there's, there's a couple other
[SPEAKER_02]: ones like the low lab and the,
and the manapur and a few other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I look at them and I know the
background on what I have a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I look at these things and I go,
Oh, that seems like maybe there is some
[SPEAKER_02]: shared heritage.
[SPEAKER_02]: There.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, that's a really cool way
to reinvigorate things without adding
[SPEAKER_02]: something that is really completely
outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do have some plans to dig into those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this coming year, I'm going to get
into a lot of Afghanis and then a few
[SPEAKER_02]: other oddball things too, and see what we
can pull out of those and then try to just
[SPEAKER_02]: get those out to a lot of different
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so that they can, you know,
so you can keep the gene pool more
[SPEAKER_02]: diverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I think when I look at some of
the stuff, it's like, it has what people,
[SPEAKER_02]: what people want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe if you do big, big selections
from them, you might be able to go,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, well, this is still without hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a thing that everybody does.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get their hands on some seeds and
then they feel like they're, they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be doing the wrong thing if they make
more seeds pure, like they're stealing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, it's like, and I'll say this
right now, just for anybody listening,
[SPEAKER_02]: if anybody gets my seeds and they like
them and they want to make more seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't feel like you're stealing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you make more seeds that are the exact
same thing, you don't always have to
[SPEAKER_02]: hybridize everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you hybridize everything,
then you lose what you started with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to put out things that are fairly
true breeding so that if somebody gets
[SPEAKER_02]: their hands on something, they can make
more pass them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can get, you know, they can,
they can get circulated and you still wind
[SPEAKER_02]: up having that preserved gene pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's not crossed with everything
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always kind of cross things together
with certain goals, but it's not just
[SPEAKER_02]: because I want to make it be different
than what I started with.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I get something and I already really
like what it is, I want to make more of
[SPEAKER_02]: that pure to have and to share.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it can be considered
unethical to make more of what someone had
[SPEAKER_02]: and then just sell it because it's like,
you're kind of undermining people's
[SPEAKER_02]: business that they have, but there's
nothing wrong with making more pure and
[SPEAKER_02]: handing those out and sharing them and
all, and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I myself personally don't care if
people make more of my same seeds pure and
[SPEAKER_02]: just sell those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I tell people to do it all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, um, you know, that is how you keep
having the same breed, um, around and not
[SPEAKER_02]: have it go, go funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I've seen most of my favorite things
I've seen over the years, they disappeared
[SPEAKER_02]: and somebody would go, Oh, I have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll be like, Oh yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did they're like, well, I crossed it
with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, wow, that's cool,
but it's going to take a lot of work to
[SPEAKER_02]: get back to where you started.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like for me, I want to take those
things, make them pure, hand those out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then then take them and maybe work
them into what I have at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't want to just always hybridize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like hybridizing to me is just getting
away from, um, from having what you
[SPEAKER_02]: already had that was good, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I notice it's what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: People get something for me and they're
like, yeah, I made a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, cool, what'd you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, well, I put it on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put it on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put it on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, did you put it on a couple of
the females of the same thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, Oh no, no, I didn't want
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to be a biter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if somebody took my stuff and made
more pure, I'd almost rather have their
[SPEAKER_02]: selections back of the same thing that
they made different than I might've made
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from the same exact thing,
then the new hybrids, because as soon as
[SPEAKER_02]: you do that, now you're back to a whole
new process again, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's my plan with those kinds
of land races.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make more pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll do some other stuff on the
side too, but I really want to circulate
[SPEAKER_02]: those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we preserve them because you've got to
keep, you've got to keep them around in
[SPEAKER_02]: their, in their original state so that you
can have them because they're a huge part
[SPEAKER_02]: of our human heritage is our, is our
plant, the diversity of our plant
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you lose those, it's,
it's fucked up, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, if we go back to something you
mentioned a little earlier, with the black
[SPEAKER_01]: aphi Hindu hybrid you used in some of your
crosses in the past, do you have access to
[SPEAKER_01]: those genetics still?
[SPEAKER_01]: And would that be some of the stuff you
might want to cross with these Afghanis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so here's what's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of seeds of the straight
black aphi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of seeds of the Hindu cross
black aphi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of seeds of the Hindu cross
black aphi cross Hindu.
[SPEAKER_02]: That crossed to the clone, which was what
right now I would love to plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those plants had like this,
almost like a gardenia smell to them,
[SPEAKER_02]: but with like a coffee skunk at the same
time, to me, like probably the best kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of stuff that I ever made.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is really similar to what wound
up making like root beer and Jaro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the starting point was the Hindu
cross black aphi, but those seeds are
[SPEAKER_02]: still alive, but not viable enough to
sprout.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've had a couple good leads on labs to
be able to do real tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I talk about it again and again,
and I'll keep on talking about it because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what we really all need is to get
somebody who can take a couple cells
[SPEAKER_02]: living out of a seed, turn them into
callus, grow them into callus,
[SPEAKER_02]: take those just like you do with mushroom
mycelium, take one plate of callus,
[SPEAKER_02]: make a hundred plates of callus,
and then start hitting them with hormones
[SPEAKER_02]: to get roots and shoots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can get plants to get back these
original things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And mine, I know we're good because as
soon as they got to the point where they
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't quite sprout all the way,
I stuck them in the fridge and I've
[SPEAKER_02]: checked on them and they're really good as
far as being alive, but they don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: enough vigor to be able to grow as a
normal plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these things, if you do get
them to pop up, they pop up, but then they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have a Maristem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they only, they come up and they have
their seed leaves and the seed leaves open
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's nothing there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes that happens and you can
leave them sitting there for two or three
[SPEAKER_02]: months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually they'll grow a branch even
from under the seed leaf or from the
[SPEAKER_02]: middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just takes a really, really long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they'll do that, it's worth doing
that with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the ones I have will only get a tail
and then they'll peter out and I can't get
[SPEAKER_02]: them to get past that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm not gonna waste them on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do have what I call root beer and
what I call Jaro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you plant a lot of them,
then you do get the throwbacks that are,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I have a clone right now that's a
throwback to the Black Affy Hindu.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: We smoked some fatties with my buddies,
came by the other day, not the other day
[SPEAKER_02]: now at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fucking time warp.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was probably a month ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we smoked it and after sitting there
for a while, we got about two thirds
[SPEAKER_02]: through the joint and everybody was like,
whoa, this ain't normal weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a funny high right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is some different shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to mention it's very tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hearty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just really, really killer weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there is that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I can take these killer Afghanis
and breed with those throws that are like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a trippy thing in my brain
where just because it's the same plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: the difference in the actual makeup of the
genetics and the provenance and the story
[SPEAKER_02]: and tracing it back, even though I know I
can pull Affy Hindu out of Jaro,
[SPEAKER_02]: I still want it without the sour diesel
and the pique in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, a lot of that is because
people assume that things like the root
[SPEAKER_02]: beer are killer only because they have the
headband in them and the Hollywood
[SPEAKER_02]: Pirkush, which are these famously potent
killer plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what people don't know is that if you
had just smoked the black Affy crossed
[SPEAKER_02]: with the Hindu, which kind of predates all
that other stuff and goes back to the 80s,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you smoke that, that was just as
chokey and had the great high and all
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants just didn't get as big.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what led me to hybridize them
with these stretchers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are things that didn't water down the
potency, but they didn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: really add any potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was already really, really dank at the
point just with the Hindu.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do still want to get those back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather work the pure Affy and the Affy
Hindu with these land races than pull out
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants that match the description.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in reality aren't the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more academic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be a different product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not even going to be more
practical.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just a thing of being like,
oh, this is pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the pure shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a funny thing in the brain where it
just makes you want that because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: story and because of what you know it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of people kind of share
that enthusiasm for purity of lineage and
[SPEAKER_02]: provenance and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a funny thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do want to dig in and do those
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the meantime, I'll definitely be
doing some hybrids with things that are
[SPEAKER_02]: the later crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just released something that was
what I call Special Indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a Ghost OG Cross Special Indica,
Cross with Special Indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gave out some of those for people to
dig through and find those old Affy types
[SPEAKER_02]: and what I call Big Blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as soon as you put OG in things,
it's like everybody thinks it's good
[SPEAKER_02]: because it has OG in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's no way to explain how
good the old stuff was when you've put OG
[SPEAKER_02]: in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really want to get back into the old,
old ones so people can understand that
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the old stuff really is as good as
the new stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how do you tell people that when the
old stuff doesn't exist?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all crossed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cross with the new stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a funny, a funny thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of merit to that
idea you just referenced with people on
[SPEAKER_01]: this never-ending quest for the purest
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, speaking of the purest stuff,
I don't think I've ever seen as much
[SPEAKER_01]: demand for any one particular strain as
what the public has for your root beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any chance people might ever see
that in pure form or are you looking to do
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing about the, the thing about the
root beer is that it's, and this is,
[SPEAKER_02]: this gets into a whole other, a whole
other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at growing weed in general,
for me, when I grow weed, the best way for
[SPEAKER_02]: me to do it is to take live soil and put
it outside under the sun and I can grow
[SPEAKER_02]: you 500 pounds for probably $2,000 tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now people want to take, and that's what
I'm talking about, like with overhead,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, of course I am not going to give
it to you for that, but if I was going to
[SPEAKER_02]: do it, I could do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people go to do that indoors and are
already looking at huge power bills.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're throwing away piles of cocoa or
rock wool in most cases, not that people
[SPEAKER_02]: don't grow soil indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people also throw away their
soil, even if they do grow in soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm paying for all these foods.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing all this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even when you're in greenhouses,
the level of issues you face with pests,
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity, you're running dehumidifiers,
you're using supplemental lighting in some
[SPEAKER_02]: cases, a huge amount of stuff,
all basically to have something that
[SPEAKER_02]: people will be able to look at and go,
ooh, wow, that's fancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of ironic because you're
going to literally light this shit on fire
[SPEAKER_02]: and throw it in a fucking ashtray,
which is probably about the dirtiest
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I'm frying on mushrooms or acid
and I look at an ashtray with dirty
[SPEAKER_02]: roaches in it and shit, I'm like,
that's the funkier shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're taking this thing and you want
it to be the most pristine and shiny and
[SPEAKER_02]: frosty and it has to have all these things
going on with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all said and done, if you take
something like root beer and you grow it
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor, it doesn't even develop quite the
type of resin and funk that it does when
[SPEAKER_02]: you grow it outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like Urkel, even OG,
I feel like is really good indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are certain things that really
indoor, they kind of live up to their
[SPEAKER_02]: potential, whereas outdoor, they might be
more potent and chokey and have a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit more of a richness to the smoke and
the flavor, but they're different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't get, they never get this
kind of bag appeal where you open a pound
[SPEAKER_02]: of indoor Urkel when it's done well is so
special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a pound of outdoor Urkel, while it's
really special, if you can appreciate it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't have the same impact and
interesting profile that you get indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my point I'm getting at is that root
beer is interesting because it's only
[SPEAKER_02]: really fit the way I bred it to be outdoor
because I bred it outdoor and I selected
[SPEAKER_02]: it outdoor and it was the nastiest,
best, most practical thing to be a large
[SPEAKER_02]: plant outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people, when they buy seeds,
they generally want to be able to put them
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor, outdoor, in a depth, whatever it
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand that because that's
what's practical.
[SPEAKER_02]: But root beer is a funny one because if I
back cross to it endlessly and make it
[SPEAKER_02]: just be straight root beer, it's really
unstable inside and in depths.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people have heard this again and
again, because I always fucking say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have this thing where I almost don't
even want to fucking get it ready to be
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor because I almost feel like if
people are that excited about it,
[SPEAKER_02]: I should just leave it as outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe people will grow some fucking
outdoor and realize the outdoor is chronic
[SPEAKER_02]: if you have the genetics that are really,
really good outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I might release it as an outdoor
seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting all the time I get a little
bit closer to not really wanting to have
[SPEAKER_02]: anything that is unreleased or that I keep
to myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's interesting is that it can
seem, it can seem greedy for people to
[SPEAKER_02]: look and go, okay, well, you won't let it
out because you just want to have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a weird thing that happens
with value where like I've still never
[SPEAKER_02]: made anything off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a root beer for myself,
but I've probably been able to bring in,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't want to put a number on
it, but there's been a lot, a lot of help
[SPEAKER_02]: and money that has gone to charity so far
just by being able to leak out a little,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, this is this cross with root beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is that cross with root beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a weird thing because if I ever
release it for myself, then that would
[SPEAKER_02]: undermine that because it doesn't bring in
as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, it's almost better to leave
it unreleased so that it can leak here and
[SPEAKER_02]: there as different things that can be more
helpful for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I can't do a charity for
myself really, because I'm not,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not how that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's hard to give up that leverage of
knowing that you have something of value
[SPEAKER_02]: when it can be really helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it's not helpful to yourself,
because for me, like I don't, like I look
[SPEAKER_02]: at it and I go, yeah, I could just release
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If everybody has it, I feel like pretty
soon it won't be that, like when cookies
[SPEAKER_02]: first came out, you could sell a clone for
five grand or a tray of clones for five
[SPEAKER_02]: grand at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now people are like, eh, cookies,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if it's the best pack of work,
something and you auction it off,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe you get a few hundred bucks,
but it's still the same weed it was when
[SPEAKER_02]: it was $5,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Root beer has that little bit of hype and
following and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has this value and it has this leverage
of people wanting it to where it makes
[SPEAKER_02]: that amount of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I release it for myself, nobody's gonna
pay $5,000 a pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I release it for charity for other
people, people will pay way more than they
[SPEAKER_02]: pay for anything else I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's almost like if I let it out and I
give it to everybody, I lose the ability
[SPEAKER_02]: to have that leverage with it for it to
have the power it has.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a weird thing, like, because I didn't
ever think I'd have anything worth shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: People didn't even want to grow my seeds
in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gave a lot of seeds to people in the
90s who grew them and made a lot of money,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a lot of people then was only four or
five people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now at this point, people are like,
root beer, root beer, and there's root
[SPEAKER_02]: beer madness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, well, I can release it,
but it'll just be another thing everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: has like cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I don't release it, then it has this
thing where it's like, hey, if somebody's
[SPEAKER_02]: really fucked, I can help them by putting
out a little bit of something crossed with
[SPEAKER_02]: root beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm up in the air, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it's a weird thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way my brain works is kind of like
fucked up because I overthink everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I'm sure you can hear the
wheels turning just as I talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that, that's kind of like how I look
at it is like, I want everybody to have
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to release it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that way I know it's preserved and
it's out there because it's really,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's very enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes you feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the plants, they grow really fast and
all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for outdoor, I think it's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have like, dude, I have so many of
the backcross three seeds now that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: like, okay, this would be a really cool
one to put out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just look at it too, where it's
like, okay, if you put everything out,
[SPEAKER_02]: then after a while, um, because I do a lot
of the charity stuff, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's almost like, well, I would be able to
benefit from it hugely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I try to figure out, well,
what do I have that I could put in for
[SPEAKER_02]: this charity stuff that would still create
this kind of a buzz in this high hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's fucking weird, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I don't, I don't know, dude,
that's a huge run on shit, which I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: totally probably at this point,
fucking known for like fucking Kevin Joe
[SPEAKER_02]: Drew or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, you know, it's my, it's my take
on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's a tricky, it's a tricky
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole, this whole hoarding hoarding
versus whoring thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't really know, um, you don't
really know what to do with stuff when you
[SPEAKER_02]: have something popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a million popular things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have tons of seeds, but you see,
there's only interest really in certain
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, uh, I always try to measure it out
and do the right shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't fucking know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets at a certain point, it's tiresome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to be like, dude,
everybody can have everything,
[SPEAKER_02]: do whatever the fuck you want with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I won't have to even think about
it anymore, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also want to be like, I want to use
the energy that's behind something.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be the most helpful and not just to
make a quick buck, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: It certainly does sound like it's a double
edged sword.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the community has seen a
number of instances where you're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, uh, walk the line of,
as you so poetically said, hoarding versus
[SPEAKER_01]: whoring, which is definitely my new
catchphrase.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for sort of the more aspiring breeders,
we might use root beer as an example,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's kind of what I've noticed
this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone did have some work that they
had made and they were sort of proud of,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd notice that like with root beer,
for example, you had a bunch of projects
[SPEAKER_01]: already finished, you know, in the bank
ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you were kind of one step ahead in
that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I noticed that there was a number
of your sort of closer friends who had the
[SPEAKER_01]: root beer cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like that might be a good sort
of duality of like, you're getting it out
[SPEAKER_01]: there enough that people can hear about it
and stimulate it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some interest in it, but at the same
time, it's not, you don't have to be too
[SPEAKER_01]: worried about giving that cause you're
kind of a few steps ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you advocate for sort of an aspiring
breeder who's made something and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking to get it a bit more popular or a
bit more notoriety?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's kind of a route in
which they could do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how would you advise people?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I had that and I smoked it for a
long time and it was pretty unknown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I knew it was really, really,
really bomb because I would try to smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: other shit and I wind up just putting out
the joint and rolling up a lime one or a
[SPEAKER_02]: root beer, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was like, okay, I know that it,
that it's really, really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gave it to a friend of mine and I
said, you know, you'd probably really like
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What had happened was he had grown,
he had grown some of it crossed him and
[SPEAKER_02]: his brother had grown some of it crossed
with the, uh, with the chem dog special
[SPEAKER_02]: reserve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, man, he goes,
you know, I had high hopes, but it just,
[SPEAKER_02]: it wasn't that great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, dude, you, it must not have
been a good cross then try the clone,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if, if you like it, keep it for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in case I lose it, I can get it back,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I gave it to him and he grew it,
um, him and his brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were like, yeah, it's,
it's fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he posted it and all of a sudden it
was like, everybody was like root beer,
[SPEAKER_02]: root beer, root beer, root beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, huh, I guess it's a really
good name and it's really got a pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: color to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just, it just kind of sparked
imagination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can't really predict what will be
what everybody really latches onto.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like people who make songs,
you know, they make an album and they go,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is the hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it turns out this other song they
thought was going to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was going to flop.
[SPEAKER_02]: This turns out to be the one that really,
really is the hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it wasn't that I didn't think it
was that it was really, really killer
[SPEAKER_02]: weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just that it was funny because no
one had smoked the weed and they heard the
[SPEAKER_02]: name and they saw the picture and it was
popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the strangest thing to me because
had they all smoked the weed, I would have
[SPEAKER_02]: understood that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you guys understand, but it only
took the name and the picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a fucking weird thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, um, it definitely is really,
really important that if you have
[SPEAKER_02]: something that you want to popularize,
you can't be the only one with it unless
[SPEAKER_02]: you're already really, really well known.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it was like this guy's account.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my friend, uh, Southern Humble
Turp Farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had an account that must've had 60,000
followers or something at the time or 40
[SPEAKER_02]: or something like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, it was just like, once he posted
it and said it was really good,
[SPEAKER_02]: then all of a sudden it was really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, wow, that's crazy because
I thought to myself, had it not been
[SPEAKER_02]: really good, I think people would still
think it's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also think that most people knew
that if it wasn't good, he wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: said it was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was like, you know,
him and his brother had killer shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, his brother makes really, really
killer, uh, live resin was one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: first people to have really crazy big fat
jars of the, of the best live,
[SPEAKER_02]: live resin figured out kind of the,
the, the tricks, um, to get the turps to
[SPEAKER_02]: separate and everything that was a little
bit ahead of the curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, so I think people kind of,
there was like a level of trust there and
[SPEAKER_02]: that helped, but I think that you do have
to be able to have things out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way you can just have it and
say it's good and everybody will believe
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, some people will believe you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, people who know you in
person and they've seen what you think is
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's what I like to look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I know somebody and I know they
only really like stuff that I like as
[SPEAKER_02]: well, cause it's all up to preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if, if that's the case, then I'm like,
okay, I got to see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll believe it's killer just
cause they said it's really killer because
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we agree on certain stuff,
but, um, you got to definitely let stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: out to an extent, but like the root beer
has only been grown by Southern Humboldt
[SPEAKER_02]: turp farm and Southern Humboldt
concentrates and skunk tech and me,
[SPEAKER_02]: nobody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has ever grown it and they've only grown
it for one run a piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for some fucking reason, the name,
the pictures, it just got this mythology
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's really funny to me because
coincidentally, it really is like my
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite weed to smoke along with the lime
one, but it doesn't make any sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really strange thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, like that's,
that was only a little bit of circulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really, really not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hasn't been out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, so I, you know,
I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll tell you straight
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do whatever you want in life in
general, and you can try as hard as you
[SPEAKER_02]: want and you can do all the right shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you don't have good fortune,
if, if good fortune doesn't fucking smile
[SPEAKER_02]: on you, then it, it doesn't fucking matter
how hard you try, but you've got to try
[SPEAKER_02]: because if you don't, then if good fortune
smiles on you, you won't have shit to shit
[SPEAKER_02]: to fucking display when the fucking,
when the sunshine hits you, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to do your best, but it's
really weird because I don't feel like,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, I don't feel like everything
that I did with, you know, whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking breed and root, period,
killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it is, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that it's not, but at the same time,
none of it makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it doesn't make sense to me that,
um, people think I'm any kind of a person
[SPEAKER_02]: to listen to about what's good or that if
I bred it and I think it's the best,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's, you know, it fucking means
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's really trippy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I think a lot of what works out
for you has to do with whether or not you,
[SPEAKER_02]: have the luck of it happening where
something gets a little bit of shine,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you do have to do all the work and you
have to just keep trying, trying,
[SPEAKER_02]: trying, trying different things,
different flavors, different crosses,
[SPEAKER_02]: different moves, sharing things with
different people, fucking just trying your
[SPEAKER_02]: best to be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, being all right,
dude, with some okay shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then maybe something takes off because
you can listen to that right there with
[SPEAKER_02]: the root beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, what, how is it popular?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're like, yeah, it's, it's this,
it's one of the most, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's even grown it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's smoked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, there's just this
mythology, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I always joke there's,
there is no root beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a real thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, it's real.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, and I have seed that actually you
can grow them and they'll all fucking be
[SPEAKER_02]: root beer, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, the facts don't really support
the outcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the, the, even though everything,
even though we know the weed is the shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant is the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, but, but how do people know
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did it connect?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like people who make a hit song
and they go, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We made it and everybody latched on and
fucking Jimi Hendrix made Foxy lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for some fucking reason, people
thought that was a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't even fucking play it.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least the root beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, yeah, but you, you gotta,
you know, you gotta shoot your shot and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and do, and do the work and then,
you know, everything else, I think kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking handles itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all just pans out to be what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, that's a weird, that's a weird thing
that I wanted to dig into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people really understand though,
it's not, it's not about, it's not all
[SPEAKER_02]: about just having perfect, perfectly
executed plans and, um, all this,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just about trying, trying,
trying, trying, doing your best,
[SPEAKER_02]: doing your best, doing your best,
and then see what the fuck happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you can't, there's no recipe other
than, um, trying your best, trying your
[SPEAKER_02]: best is the, is the master key to fucking
anything working a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like there's some formulation out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while we may not know it, it certainly
seems like, you know, hard work,
[SPEAKER_01]: good genetics and luck are certainly a bit
of a mix in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting if we just jump back to a
question we spoke about a couple questions
[SPEAKER_01]: back, you mentioned how, you know,
people will see headband or OG in the mix
[SPEAKER_01]: of the listed genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden it like gets them
interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was interested in asking you,
I've noticed you tend to work a lot with
[SPEAKER_01]: both ghost OG, which I've seen in some of
your more recent crosses, as well as with
[SPEAKER_01]: the Skywalker OG, which people will
probably remember is a big part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: SkyCard LaCouche.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you say that these two are your
favorite OGs?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you had to pick one or the other,
what would be your absolute favorite OG to
[SPEAKER_01]: work with within your projects?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the original, my original experience
with OG, which when I first got it,
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought was the original OG,
um, which is fully not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even a pure OG, but the Hollywood
peer Kush is the one that is the most
[SPEAKER_02]: present in my work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because I got it before I had
anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I got it 2004, 2005.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, now that one is, um, neat because you
cross it with things and it doesn't,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, crybaby organics was talking about
this on a post the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are certain plants that you use as a
mother for seeds, where when you cross to
[SPEAKER_02]: them, it, it adds something without taking
something away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, using the pure Kush was
interesting because it doesn't,
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't, it's not a bully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you cross with it and whatever male
you hit it with, most of your seeds come
[SPEAKER_02]: out smelling like the male side.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, in the case of all the things
that I used with it, which were these
[SPEAKER_02]: squat Indica's, which tended to want to
get bud mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they didn't yield a lot in a large
pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was growing medical gardens where you
could only have 25 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want them to be as big as they can
get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it made things more rangy and it
didn't dilute their potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in some cases it added to their
potency, depending on what you were using.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was the one that I used.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, um, that was the prevalent one
in my crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now something like sky cuddler Kush,
I took, uh, big red, put it on Hindu
[SPEAKER_02]: clone, put it on pure Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I put it on Skywalker, but I took
that and I put it back on the pure Kush
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing about the pure Kush is that it's
a finicky plant and something like sky
[SPEAKER_02]: cuddler Kush has so much PK in it that if
you grow it good and you know how to grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh geez, just like the pure Kush clone,
the pure Kush clone, if you grow it well,
[SPEAKER_02]: you get these huge buds that are caked in
resin that are super dense, that are super
[SPEAKER_02]: loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you smoke them, you're like,
wow, there's not anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's literally the flower is more potent
in your chest than most hash, which I had
[SPEAKER_02]: never really seen before that,
except maybe on the black lime or on the,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, Hindu Afi, which were both things that
I crossed to it to make what became lime
[SPEAKER_02]: one and what I called OG coffee,
which was the father of root beer and what
[SPEAKER_02]: I call Jaro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, when you grow these things,
if you grow them right, they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you might not even know why you grew
them, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But they come out great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get these huge plants with huge colas
and they're fucking excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people fuck them up and they
don't know how they fucked them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't tell them how they fucked them
up other than maybe under watering,
[SPEAKER_02]: over watering, like really hard for a few
little rounds to where the metabolism of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant gets fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden they have weed
that's either larvae or light,
[SPEAKER_02]: or it's just not quite right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, well, I don't really know
what to tell you because when you grow a
[SPEAKER_02]: normal soil mix and you don't fuck with
anything, they just have these plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: they just throw down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you fuck them up, then you see that
PK weirdness where all of a sudden you're
[SPEAKER_02]: like, Oh man, these just don't,
they're not doing what I want them to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a, it's a weird thing that the PK
brings to the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the PK also brings a certain level of
instability to the table, which is the
[SPEAKER_02]: same deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you grow them a certain way,
they're fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you grow them another way, once again,
which I can't really pin down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like when I had the, the Hindu,
the big red on the Hindu on the PK,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, I call it OG cuddler or red Hindu Kush
because big red Hindu pure Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, people would grow them, grow them
indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow them outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody grows a pack indoor or outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole pack has fucking sexual
instability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, well, there's already
been a whole bunch of these have been
[SPEAKER_02]: grown perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now these ones, they freaked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like OG crosses, diesel crosses,
cookie crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll talk to somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll go, Oh, those seeds are shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all Hermes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'll talk to somebody else and
they'll go, I agree with three or four
[SPEAKER_02]: packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were all great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever it is that makes these things
freak out, it makes them freak out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's something that's coming from in
the case of like a red Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was, uh, you know, coming from
that PK clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the PK clone is this weird thing
because it either gives you the best thing
[SPEAKER_02]: ever, or it gives you stuff that fucks up
on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, the nature of how I grow is so
simple that I don't ever see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't ever have plants that are fucking
awful unless I grow something that's
[SPEAKER_02]: really outlandishly shitty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just know it's going to be really
bad because it's a weird fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: auto-ruder Alice or some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the only things I can remember
that were really bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, but the PK is a trip like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the OG that really is the most
prevalent in my work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the ghost, I took the sky Jaro,
which is Jaro, um, so that's Hindu crossed
[SPEAKER_02]: with a black a female.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I called that black coffee at the
time, but that's a dead, what I call the
[SPEAKER_02]: deadline.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, it's, it's not out there
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, right now people like a bio
vortex black dog crossed with coffee from
[SPEAKER_02]: Kaia at green source gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a black coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a shit because my black
coffee is a deadline.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only been used in, um, something that
is later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't have a black coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a black coffee, but I don't use that
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the Hindu, the AFI on the Hindu.
[SPEAKER_02]: I crossed that with a Hollywood peer cush
and then I put that on the sour diesel
[SPEAKER_02]: that made Jaro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put that on the Skywalker, the
Skywalker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked it was stretchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was vigorous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had the really clear OG smell different
from the ghost where it was more chemical,
[SPEAKER_02]: less earth, less skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked the shininess of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked the vigor of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, so I had that, I had the sky
jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all came out like really nice OG and
some OG plants breed more OG and some
[SPEAKER_02]: breed less pure Kush is more transparent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get a lot of OG from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you get a lot more of what the male
side was Skywalker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a lot of OG from it, which leads me
to believe it was more bottlenecked.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was probably an S two or S three or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that made the sky jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took that and I put that on the ghost
because I had grown, um, I had grown the
[SPEAKER_02]: ghost S ones and they were really
consistently all kind of an OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, okay, well I know that the
ghost is throwing a lot of OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the PK wouldn't have done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The PK throws a lot more plain stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It throws some purples that are like
lavender.
[SPEAKER_02]: It throws these colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cotton candy type of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really nice, but it's not all OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ghost growing the S ones from it was
like, okay, you get a lot of the real OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sky jar was all OG basically with a
little, you know, a little bit different,
[SPEAKER_02]: not, not all the loudest, um, and a little
bit more vigor, longer canes, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little faster finishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I put that on the ghost to make
the ghost cross sky jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because everybody wanted like a cush seed
that would be vigorous and better than an
[SPEAKER_02]: OG clone as far as how it does in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so I did that and that was the
ghost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I also did the ghost with the
lime pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those came out really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked those a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I handed them almost all out as testers
and then I lost the lime pop mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had very few of the seeds left back
to continue the line, but I went ahead and
[SPEAKER_02]: did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this year I kept that going to the F
twos, but I gave them all almost all out
[SPEAKER_02]: as testers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I figured if everybody grew them and
they were great, then I could take the
[SPEAKER_02]: line pop mail I had as a clone and I could
put it back on the ghost and I could
[SPEAKER_02]: produce those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that could be one thing that I kind of
had as one of my, my staples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it was such nice weed when I grew
it, um, outside inside it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: unstable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to keep getting worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, hopefully by F three F four,
I can have something that's nice and I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: put that back out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, the ghost is killer to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the real heavy fucking OG,
the real deal, real OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skywalker is a little bit more,
a little bit lighter of a high,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit bigger, heartier of a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes these really big, pretty seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the PK really brings a lot of
potency and it breeds a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: transparently, which I really like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm most of the time, I'm not trying
to breed an OG in seed form.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to use what's good about the OG
and tack it onto what I already have on
[SPEAKER_02]: the male side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the PK, unlike a lot of OGs,
it drops hash a little bit better,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, because of its, uh, what's in it as
opposed to where the OG is fairly greasy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll drop some hash, but the PK drops
hash closer and more like a Bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the, um, you know, that's the
reason for there being a lot of PKs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the first one I had and I
believed it to be really old, pure OG
[SPEAKER_02]: based on the way the weed was when I got
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But later on kind of found out that it's
not, uh, you know, it actually has other
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a detailed breakdown of what sort of
each of the OGs you work with is bringing
[SPEAKER_01]: to the table in your crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we last spoke, uh, it feels as
though the backstories behind the OG Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: itself have been fleshed out a fair bit
more with TK Origins kind of coming out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the shadows and explaining his story.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing I wanted to ask you about was
that a lot of people might be aware that
[SPEAKER_01]: he speaks about how he was growing a
strain called Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he suspects the male involved in the
pollination was probably a Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he was pushed to give some sort of
guess about what this Emerald Triangle
[SPEAKER_01]: strain was, he frequently says probably
some sort of Hindu Kush sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes me wonder, could you believe
that, like, or do you believe that OG Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: is possibly just some sort of Hindu in
cross?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we are to, if, if what TK Origins says
is correct, could you say that,
[SPEAKER_01]: or do you have a suspicion that maybe
there's some other genetics in the mix?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, there's an interesting thing
at play here that, uh, this is a,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is a multi-layered thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so Hindu Kush, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hindu Kush, I've always kind of wondered
about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hindu Kush is a region, um, within that
region are tons of different micro regions
[SPEAKER_02]: where different strains would have come
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I always wondered what is Hindu
Kush?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a Sacred Seeds Hindu Kush
that came out marketed as being skunky in
[SPEAKER_02]: the early eighties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was
[SPEAKER_02]: originally Neville had a, uh, this is
where it's hard to kind of sift through
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Originally Neville had a Northern Lights
one and a Northern Lights two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I believe Greg McAllister says the
further towards the one you go,
[SPEAKER_02]: the pure, more pure the Afghani is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, so there's a trippy thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Northern Lights one then would have
been just straight, straight broadleaf
[SPEAKER_02]: gnarliness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Northern Lights two would have been
two based on everybody's descriptions of
[SPEAKER_02]: what those were at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, now Neville had those originally,
he marketed those, I believe, and this is,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is info from seed banks that,
um, I have the catalogs and I've read
[SPEAKER_02]: about them, but this was brought up again
by, by my buddy, uh, not so dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he pointed out something, which was
pretty interesting that in one year,
[SPEAKER_02]: Neville has Northern Lights with the
description, uh, Northern Lights two,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, maybe one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the following year, now it is,
I believe, Sensi seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't, you know, don't take that as the
gospel because it could have still been
[SPEAKER_02]: his own thing, but I believe what happened
was when he shifted his stock from seed
[SPEAKER_02]: bank to Sensi seed bank, um, the names
changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what was originally Northern Lights
two, and once again, this is just how I
[SPEAKER_02]: remember it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never put too much into really
remembering the details of it because I
[SPEAKER_02]: know I can access that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it changed from Northern Lights to
being labeled as Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: So apparently there's a Hindu Kush as a
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said before, it's a region.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there would have really been a lot of
things, but what we would have had in
[SPEAKER_02]: California labeled as Hindu Kush or
Florida labeled as Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would have either been Hindu Kush from
sacred seeds in like 83, or it would have
[SPEAKER_02]: been Hindu Kush, which was Northern Lights
renamed as Hindu Kush by Sensi seeds or by
[SPEAKER_02]: seed bank in, which would have been more
like 86, 87, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now in terms of seeds, the, the,
these timeframes, these are right next to
[SPEAKER_02]: each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like someone who got cookies in
2000, 2016 or 2013, fucking cookies,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but somebody who got those two
things back then seems like it probably
[SPEAKER_02]: would have been two different things
because I don't think the Hindu Kush
[SPEAKER_02]: sacred seeds had is the same as the Hindu
Kush that Neville had.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Neville knew that this heavy
Afghani type would have been from the
[SPEAKER_02]: Hindu Kush region.
[SPEAKER_02]: And instead of calling it Northern Lights
because he at that point had had the
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern Lights number five and stuff,
there was a little more of a hybrid type.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had named the ones that were closer to
being a pure Afghani type as being Hindu
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush, probably because Hindu Kush sounds
different than Afghani and Afghani number
[SPEAKER_02]: one was out at the time, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, that is all to say that when I
had my Northern Lights and I started
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding it in the mid-20th century,
mid-90s, originally, before I had actually
[SPEAKER_02]: made seed, I started seeing these ones
that would pop out in the compost pile
[SPEAKER_02]: when it would seed itself and the seeds
would get thrown away.
[SPEAKER_02]: That my, my dad at the time was every once
in a while would be like, oops,
[SPEAKER_02]: something got fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, there's some seeded stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, it gets pulled out when it gets
trimmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get thrown in the compost pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, George would have a plant in the
compost pile pretty much every year and
[SPEAKER_02]: they'd be these really nice things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd be just pretty much like the clone,
but they were very indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: They seemed a little more broadleaf when
you grew them from seed than when they did
[SPEAKER_02]: from clone, which I think is kind of
typical of plants in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first big fan leafs that come up on an
immature plant before it sexes,
[SPEAKER_02]: they really want to get big and chunky and
fat because I think probably they're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to do their best to really get a
fucking head start.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the Northern Lights that we had
would have probably been like a Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: Lights five cross Northern Lights two or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant itself to me was not what I
would consider to be a pure broadleaf as a
[SPEAKER_02]: clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very, very similar looking to an OG
Kush clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I made things like when I bred
through the jarrow or sky jarrow,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera, I would look for these things
that were like the Northern Lights we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was very dark, dark green,
the leaves, they were shiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would usually have five or seven
leaflets, never more.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had crazy, the clone itself,
it had crazy, crazy amounts of resin on
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was resin that liked to fall off like
an Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: The potency was just insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely right up there with something
like an OG or a sour or a chem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kind of had this structure that was
fairly thin stem, not what I would
[SPEAKER_02]: normally consider to be a straight
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Afghanistan has a really diverse gene
pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying that the Northern Lights
we had wasn't like a Bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now something like a Bubba is exactly,
I mean, almost impossible to tell the
[SPEAKER_02]: difference between good Bubba and good
Hindu, which we had around here,
[SPEAKER_02]: which we called Hindu-Indu.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy who had it the most around
here was my buddy Jayla.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jayla, he had this Hindu clone that he
called Hindu-Indu, and it was fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like Bubba, but more visibly
white and frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had that same kind of a thing where it
had this smell that was like coffee,
[SPEAKER_02]: earth, soap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it was a really trippy
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost had like a plant latex smell to it
a little bit, like when you break open,
[SPEAKER_02]: like milkweed or dandelions or real
cocaine, which I personally have never
[SPEAKER_02]: done, but which I have seen in certain
situations where people had it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was curious about what it looks
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just never was my thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tasted it, made me angry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never really tried it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a toothache one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put it on that real effective,
but it has something like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that plant latex thing that's hard to
describe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so anyway, this is all just digging in
to kind of give an idea of a backstory of
[SPEAKER_02]: all this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So also it really liked to drop resin like
my clone did, but they were very
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in about 2003, I would say,
my buddy Big L used to like to come up and
[SPEAKER_02]: grab weed from people in Mendo to take to
LA, and he would buy the Hindu from the
[SPEAKER_02]: Hindu clone, and he would sell it in LA as
Bubba, and he would get major top dollar
[SPEAKER_02]: for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like unheard of shit, but because it was
Bubba, and the people who wanted it knew
[SPEAKER_02]: their shit, but they still were like,
yeah, this is Bubba, but it wasn't Bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Hindu.
[SPEAKER_02]: The backstory on the Hindu, it turns out,
before Jay Lao got it, it went to his
[SPEAKER_02]: buddy up there and leg it, and the person
who gave it to him, it turns out,
[SPEAKER_02]: was a friend of mine who was an older lady
who's probably about 65, 70, really cool
[SPEAKER_02]: lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said she got it from a guy named
Frank who had a heroin problem who lived
[SPEAKER_02]: here where I live, and that was around 84
or 85.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I believe that because it was so long
back, she had actually mixed it up,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was probably a little bit later,
because I personally think that she got it
[SPEAKER_02]: from Frank and that Frank probably got it
from Neville once the Northern Lights name
[SPEAKER_02]: had been changed to Hindu Kush in 86 or 87
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if you get something 30-some years
ago, it's really easy to think you got it
[SPEAKER_02]: 32 years ago instead of 34 years ago,
or 36 years ago, instead of 39 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that what we called Hindu Kush
up here, which is the same as Bubba,
[SPEAKER_02]: was probably from that seed bank release,
which was Northern Lights after it had
[SPEAKER_02]: been changed to be called Hindu Kush,
and that Bubba Kush is almost the same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you hear the story that people tell
about the earliest Bubba Kush,
[SPEAKER_02]: they say they think it was a Northern
Lights cross, and if you hear the
[SPEAKER_02]: description from OriginsTK, who I've
talked with a lot, because at one point I
[SPEAKER_02]: almost wondered if the Emerald Triangle
had been the clone that we had that my mom
[SPEAKER_02]: popped, because she popped it in 89,
but he said that the Emerald Triangle they
[SPEAKER_02]: had had since probably about 87,
which would make it impossible that it was
[SPEAKER_02]: that clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why would my crazy ass think that it
could have been our clone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was only the fact that when I bred with
things from OG and I was looking for OG,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had really good luck finding males that
would throw OG by looking for the same
[SPEAKER_02]: look as our Northern Lights clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Northern Lights had been very
consistent, so I wouldn't be surprised if
[SPEAKER_02]: what he's calling Hindu Kush is what is in
fact Northern Lights, and Neville was
[SPEAKER_02]: taking Northern Lights and calling it
Hindu Kush, and what he used could have
[SPEAKER_02]: actually been Northern Lights cross
Northern Lights, and that OG Kush could be
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern Lights cross Northern Lights,
which I have been saying since long before
[SPEAKER_02]: his story ever popped up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been saying that I believed OG Kush
to be some type of a cross of Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't really know exactly the real
stories of whatever everything is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why I believe Origins TK after
talking to him was that he doesn't put any
[SPEAKER_02]: ego on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't say, oh well I took it and I
grew a thousand plants and they were all
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty shitty, but I found a crazy one and
I did this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, oh no dude I grew some shit and
there was like these couple seeds and then
[SPEAKER_02]: there's fucking shit and it just happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the stories that I've ever heard
of the best stuff seem to come out of
[SPEAKER_02]: stories like that that are a little bit
more random, a little bit less
[SPEAKER_02]: self-involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually if someone has an elaborate story
that makes them look like a mastermind,
[SPEAKER_02]: it kind of makes you seem like you're
probably full of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you say that you just had a happy
accident, that seems to be kind of where
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff comes from more often than not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why I give his story some
airtime in my brain of going, okay well
[SPEAKER_02]: let's see what that means.
[SPEAKER_02]: If this means this and that means that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of the details kind of add up and
that's the reason why I go on such a big
[SPEAKER_02]: clusterfuck convoluted story of this and
that and this so that you can kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: picture how it looks in my head with my
experience because it does all make sense
[SPEAKER_02]: to an extent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody needs to make a meme of me with a
stupid face with the letters where it's
[SPEAKER_02]: capital small case, capital small case and
it says everything and it says Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: Lights isn't everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm the dumbass who at this point
does think that it isn't everything
[SPEAKER_02]: because I believe that at some point
cookies has baba in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that at some point OG has Hindu
and Northern Lights which it turns out are
[SPEAKER_02]: probably the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that Sour Diesel has it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Chem D has Northern Lights in it
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have my Northern Lights oil can
which is Bahakan Afghani on our Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: Lights clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That crossed to the Northern Lights
several times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anybody who's had a lot of Chem can
smell what I'm pulling out of those seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And without it seeming like it is Chem D
because it has different aspects to the
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of the resin and the way the resin
looks under a loop and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to kind of, I should probably get
it to somebody to gene test it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though Filos is full of shit,
they probably have the bigger gene,
[SPEAKER_02]: the bigger database right now to look at
genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very, there's a lot of what I call
hot garbage that's like the Chem D smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in there from that Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, it's a really
interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with that whole story, in my delusion
at one point talking to Origins TK,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had been like, well, Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, I live in the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Late 80s, who had clones in the late 80s?
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember in 94, I brought a clone to my
buddy OG Foundations Farms and most of the
[SPEAKER_02]: old timers from the neighborhood who had
had dank shit starting all the way back in
[SPEAKER_02]: the 70s, even the 60s going into the 80s
when what we wound up getting from those
[SPEAKER_02]: old timers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody came to see what does a plant
look like from clone?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was 94, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a Northern Lights clone and we
had had it since 89.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my point to that is that most people
had never seen a clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd only ever seen two clones by the time
I was 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, maybe by the time I was 14.
[SPEAKER_02]: One was the purple one in Leggett.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one was Northern Lights that my
mom took.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point, everybody else popped
seed every time because what a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people don't realize these days is in
those days, you didn't have to have a bag
[SPEAKER_02]: of weed that was all one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you would have a bag of weed and you
would be like, oh, look, there's a purple
[SPEAKER_02]: bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a green bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a leafy bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a hard bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those pounds, that's how pounds looked
all the way until 2002 or 2003.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't fucking matter until Urkel hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden everything had to
be all one clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: All in one bag, the way people had been
used to indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the way until that point, you only saw
pounds that were all one thing if they
[SPEAKER_02]: were indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And indoor, all the way until 95,
96, maybe right into there, indoor was
[SPEAKER_02]: always worth less than outdoor because
everybody got it and they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's cool, but you don't get high as long.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flavor's not as deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't look quite right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too bright.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks all white.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have that real fucking look.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so indoor was like a bad thing all the
way until the late nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people don't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only time it was different was
maybe if you were in a place where there
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So weed was just weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it was chronic, it was chronic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, people in the mid nineties,
of course, who were buying like indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel or whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're buying that and it's super
high dollar, 10, $12,000 pounds on the
[SPEAKER_02]: East coast and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in California, if weed was worth 36
outdoor, indoor was worth 32.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always worth less to have indoor
weed all the way to a point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as indoor really caught on,
it was only a matter of time before
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor had to follow the indoor trend,
which was to be growing all the way all
[SPEAKER_02]: one thing and having all one thing in a
bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden, that's how it
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: But back in the days, it wasn't really
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all just a mix in a bag,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know where the fuck I went with
this now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a fucking stoner trailing off,
but this is all true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if I don't know what I'm talking
about, even when I ride, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you covered both, you know,
the OG, the Northern Lights, the Hindu,
[SPEAKER_01]: the indoor outdoor, just so many things in
that answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've got to ask you a bunch of
follow ups on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, the first one is, do you think
that that change in like outdoor being
[SPEAKER_01]: worth more to suddenly indoor being worth
more?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that was because of like
rappers and people talking about it and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe even a growing focus on the
aesthetics of the plant, which I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: guessing maybe at the time indoor started
to out edge it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think it was other factors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so, I mean, I spaced out on what I
was talking about there, but I realized
[SPEAKER_02]: what I was talking about was the reason
why clone weed from clones became popular,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason weed from clones became
popular was because of indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think indoor became popular because
people were growing from clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you got indoor at a certain
point, people were growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they were growing indoor, they were
growing a clone because indoor it was more
[SPEAKER_02]: sketchy to grow from seed because if you
grew from seed indoor, they're all you
[SPEAKER_02]: might have different heights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them might be unstable,
whatever happened, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you grew from a clone that was
proven like that purple clone or that
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern Lights clone, then it was like,
okay, now you have a predictable crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll all have an even canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll all finish the same day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, electricity is expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to know exactly what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like indoor was a different game.
[SPEAKER_02]: So clones started to have this advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think at a certain point,
that's why clones became popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once that happened, what people
started to realize was when you buy
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor, the whole bag is the same fucking
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you really like a pound of indoor
diesel, you like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is something you can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more like a branded product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas before it was like, oh,
you want a soda?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a fucking soda.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once indoor came in, it was like,
okay, you want a Coca-Cola, get a
[SPEAKER_02]: Coca-Cola.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before that, when you'd have your
garden would be done and you'd be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: ooh, ooh, there's that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, go ahead and pull out a little
bit of that and swap it out with this
[SPEAKER_02]: right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we want to stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the good one, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't like the stuff wasn't so
particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weed was worth so much money that it
wasn't like, uh, in a lot of cases you
[SPEAKER_02]: couldn't, you know, years later,
it was like, I started smoking 10 pounds a
[SPEAKER_02]: year or something, you know, because it
was like, you could just take whatever you
[SPEAKER_02]: want and go, okay, we want this one,
this one, do that separate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But originally it was so valuable that
you'd be like, all right, well the odds of
[SPEAKER_02]: and ends after all is said and done,
we'll put that aside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it weighs a quarter pound,
then maybe we can dig through the pounds
[SPEAKER_02]: and find the ones we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll take this stuff and we'll swap
it back in and wind up with a quarter
[SPEAKER_02]: pound we really want instead of the one we
were left with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that part of what popularized
indoor was the fact that when people grew
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor, it was all one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you buy something and it's more
predictable, I think that's kind of a
[SPEAKER_02]: value added product where you're like,
okay, well, you know, it was cool to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: sack of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you're like, I really liked that
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the fact that people weren't doing
that outdoor because outdoor people were
[SPEAKER_02]: growing off from seed, unless you were
like the people who were getting clones
[SPEAKER_02]: from us back in the day who were growing
Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, it's, I think, I think that
had a big influence with being something
[SPEAKER_02]: that you knew what you were getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think indoor, it's one thing
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mixed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that had a big, um,
I think that had a big, a big role in kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of dividing the markets and making indoor
be something that was more sought after.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course, people figured out how
to grow indoor really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, in mass, believe it or not,
a lot of, I mean, right now still a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of fucking outdoors,
a lot of outdoor sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying, you know, like indoors
worse than outdoor, but in all the way
[SPEAKER_02]: through the nineties, a lot of times if
you saw indoor, it would be, people would
[SPEAKER_02]: be like, all right, we need to get it out
to get the next running.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cut a little early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's handled, it's all green trimmed
and handle a lot so they can get it out
[SPEAKER_02]: the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dried a lot faster because we need to
get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like at a certain point when people
started doing connoisseur level indoor,
[SPEAKER_02]: that really, I think helped to drive up
the value of indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think as funny as it is that that
happened in places where there was less
[SPEAKER_02]: weed faster because people valued it more
highly and would have less and so would
[SPEAKER_02]: handle it better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's where like.
[SPEAKER_02]: East coast indoor being so fucking good in
the nineties was the deal where the people
[SPEAKER_02]: who are on the East coast who are the real
connoisseurs happen to be growing indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people on the West coast in the
nineties who were the real connoisseurs
[SPEAKER_02]: were growing outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people who were growing weed on
the, in the indoors on the West coast in
[SPEAKER_02]: the nineties were more, uh, were more
concerned about it as a product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're kind of just busting it out,
busting it out, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that kind of,
uh, I think that kept it, that kept it not
[SPEAKER_02]: being as good of a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when people started like,
okay, let's really do really nice indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, then, then it stepped it up a lot,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's, I think that's,
that's part of the dynamic and that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: to say that's the answer to all of it,
but I, those are, those are things that I
[SPEAKER_02]: noticed and looking in, you know,
uh, retrospectively at like the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the difference and how the East coast
had this really killer mid nineties
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not saying that the people I know
didn't have it then it was just that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In like 1993, you were almost better off
saying, if you have really nice indoor,
[SPEAKER_02]: just being like, yeah, this is killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is killer outdoor and you'd get a
better price.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because people were used to it
being that, um, indoor in the derogatory
[SPEAKER_02]: sense where you go, dude, it's just like
not, you know, and I still see that kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of indoor from people where I'm just like,
I don't really know what you did,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, and then the insane indoor
that you see that you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is the greatest weed on earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people have that, but it would
typically be like the lady with one light
[SPEAKER_02]: or the lady with three lights or the dude
with eight lights or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those would be the ones that you'd be
like, Whoa, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, that was the stuff that,
that you, that you look at and you go,
[SPEAKER_02]: this should be worth more than outdoor,
but because it wasn't the norm,
[SPEAKER_02]: it didn't, um, it didn't represent itself
enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there was like, it's like,
you know, kind of like a boutique market,
[SPEAKER_02]: like people who know, no, they want these
three pounds from this lady that only has
[SPEAKER_02]: three pounds every two and a half months.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people who know, but at the same
time, if people are just looking for a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of indoor, they're like,
yeah, my price is this for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's this for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, outdoor was more valuable
all the way until at least the mid
[SPEAKER_02]: nineties for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that totally makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way you describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really interesting to hear how things
kind of changed in the Emerald triangle
[SPEAKER_01]: from outdoor to indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, obviously outdoor is still
very possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love the little anecdote about,
you know, the old lady with the three
[SPEAKER_01]: lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, speaking of, uh, I'd love to,
if you're willing to chat about,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, some history from your mom,
if possible, because when I talk to the
[SPEAKER_01]: real heads, like Bodie and Mr. Bob
Hemphill and stuff, they always tell me
[SPEAKER_01]: they're like, man, you want to know a real
OG of the Emerald triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mean Gene's mom, she was laying some
groundwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did she ever tell you any cool stories
about like, you know, bud from yesteryear
[SPEAKER_01]: that she was able to smoke or like sort of
the way she and her friends used to do
[SPEAKER_01]: things back in the day?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, my, my mom, my mom is not
somebody who I would say is, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a, there's a funny thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've kind of addressed this a little
bit because of, of people being full of
[SPEAKER_02]: shit and not really understanding the
reality of, of, uh, of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people go, Oh, well you're,
you're fucking second generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just had it all handed to you and
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, just to break down the
reality of it is honestly, my generation
[SPEAKER_02]: was the first ones and not even,
you know, unfortunately, not even me,
[SPEAKER_02]: but my generation was the first people who
realized how to actually make money off a
[SPEAKER_02]: lead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my mom's generation, was like,
they would grow a little bit and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: almost impossible to have anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if, you know, it was all a learning
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the deer would eat your crop,
the rip-offs would take your crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the neighbors would take your
crop, fucking your crop would be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone would pull the fucking windows
off your fucking house and take your crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, my mom's not somebody who's
ever made any of her money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like she, she didn't, she's not like,
uh, a big, um, a big farmer who made money
[SPEAKER_02]: off of weed and shit, you know,
it was like, she tried to survive working,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, other jobs and, and,
and trying to have a couple of plants so
[SPEAKER_02]: that maybe she could, um, so that she
could be a little bit more normal in the
[SPEAKER_02]: country, because here, there's not,
uh, there's not a lot of opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, my mom trimmed other people's
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom washed dishes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, she, she opened the first recycling
center in this area and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: barely made a tiny bit of money off of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so, you know, the, the, the,
the first gen or the first generation of
[SPEAKER_02]: people who were the real, who were the
real people who really figured things out,
[SPEAKER_02]: they, they didn't get to really reap the
rewards of all this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, you know, when, when people say
like, oh, whatever, you know, your shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: your parents were ballers and grew weed
and fuck, you know, they don't understand
[SPEAKER_02]: that there was no, uh, there was no,
there was no coolness.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no, oh, I grew weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Mr. Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have a brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to look fancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be fucking, you know,
people are going to kiss my ass because I
[SPEAKER_02]: got some fucking weed and all this shit
that fucking people come in carpet bag and
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to fucking do their little bullshit
with, you know, um, shit was rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't anything that you would do
because it's your dream and all this
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking shit with these jokers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was basically, um,
survival and it was risking your ass
[SPEAKER_02]: knowing that you might be fucking up and
you might be, you might be destroying your
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking chances of having a good life by
taking these risks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, you know,
you're putting yourself out there because
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't know what else to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there really isn't anything else to do
because you live in a place where it's
[SPEAKER_02]: nice and you know, it's safe for your kids
because you're in the country and you have
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of different opportunities for the
things that we as a species do really well
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we, as a society, you know,
it wasn't really any of the stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: most people get the benefits of who live
in places where things are nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the woods and, uh, you know,
it's a trippy fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got to throw that out there because
of how people like to perceive things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these people I'm talking about are not
Bodie and these guys, cause they
[SPEAKER_02]: understand that they know, they know what
the fuck's up, you know, but, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the trippy thing is that, uh,
my mom, the first thing I can remember her
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about that was really,
really stand out was the, was what they
[SPEAKER_02]: called the Missouri, which was weed from
Mazar in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, she said it was big, big,
tall fucking plants, but then they budded
[SPEAKER_02]: with these huge fat fucking buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just the most gorgeous shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they grew it in a Creek bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out in Woodman Canyon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had, uh, it had these big,
um, these big, beautiful buds on it that
[SPEAKER_02]: she said were just, they had never seen
anything like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just so fucking incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they grew it for a year or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like 84, 85 or 85, 86.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in making the seeds at some
point, the wrong one got picked and my
[SPEAKER_02]: dad, my, my stepdad, um, who I don't like
to really call my stepdad, but that's just
[SPEAKER_02]: for technicalities.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my, my dad, who I grew up with,
my mom's boyfriend, um, he said that at a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain point it just turned into lettuce
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really wasn't anything that all of
a sudden it was like, well, you can't grow
[SPEAKER_02]: this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they lost it and they were super
bummed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he started growing what he got
from his buddy, Charlie, which was Wahak
[SPEAKER_02]: in Afghani, which he later gave to,
um, our buddy Ted, who, who passed away,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, years ago now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ted ended up giving it to this other
guy who was out there in the Canyon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was the one Ted and his worker who
is this other guy, they would get clones
[SPEAKER_02]: from my mom, which was the Northern
Lights, all the way starting in like maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: 92 or 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they grew them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he would grow it and he would
back cross it to his, um, to his Wahak in
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghani, which he called the oil can and
the stoil, depending on what it smelled
[SPEAKER_02]: like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he back crossed and back crossed and
back crossed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what my buddy ended up taking
and giving it to our other buddy who bred
[SPEAKER_02]: it a couple of times, gave it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we call POG or,
uh, Northern Lights oil can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what that, that's what that
actually comes out of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like tracing it back,
going back to whatever 87 or something
[SPEAKER_02]: when George got that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, then, you know, like,
uh, my mom wasn't like a heavy smoker or
[SPEAKER_02]: anything, but I mean, some of the special
stuff I remember seeing was like when she
[SPEAKER_02]: took me up there to leg it to that lady's
house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I saw that perp, that purple,
and then, um, you know, the various
[SPEAKER_02]: things, but really after 89, the Northern
Lights was like our workhouse plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: our workhorse plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was what was around all the way
really until, uh, the mid nineties,
[SPEAKER_02]: we moved to Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_02]: We came back and it was still around,
but I had some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were, we were doing other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, then I thought it was gone all
the way till like 2004, 2005.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I talked to my buddy down in
Healdsburg and he was like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, we still got, we still got those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Oh, I want to get them
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he brought them to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turned out he thought I wanted the
dirt big bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and he didn't know that I wanted the
dirt the Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got the dirt big, but I seeded it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what the pina comes out of,
but he had the Northern Lights still at
[SPEAKER_02]: that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I talked to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was probably in maybe July or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I remember I seeded those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were still small and they were done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to be fairly late in the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I ended up talking to him when he
gave me those and telling him,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I'd like to get those other
ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, cool, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Down in Sonoma County in Healdsburg,
the Russian river flooded and his buddy
[SPEAKER_02]: had a trailer where they kept their moms
and it was just a mom operation where they
[SPEAKER_02]: would get all their clones out of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the whole fucking trailer washed away
in the fucking flood down the Russian
[SPEAKER_02]: river.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they lost it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was, so that was like the,
the, the one real, the one plant that my
[SPEAKER_02]: mom really kept, um, was gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she had already not had it for like 10
years, but they had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was just like this huge tragedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to this day, it's like, every time
someone says they have a Northern Lights
[SPEAKER_02]: clone, I'm always like, Oh, well what's it
look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's what I was getting into
when I trailed off and I forgot what I was
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about earlier was that the
Northern Lights was really one of the only
[SPEAKER_02]: things you would see around that was a
clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw the exact same clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd come back from Chico.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw it come back from up further North.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it circulated a lot because back then
it was like, Oh, if somebody wants clones,
[SPEAKER_02]: they would get something that was already
grown from clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: They knew it was good indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once people got those,
they would mother them up and they would,
[SPEAKER_02]: they would sell clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they kept it really limited because
clone, you know, clone cloning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it wasn't really a popular thing to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I noticed, I know different
people did kept a couple of clones all
[SPEAKER_02]: over cause there's clones from the
nineties, but cloning became much more
[SPEAKER_02]: popular in the two thousands than when the
late, the late nineties than it was in the
[SPEAKER_02]: eighties and the early nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like think probably someone still
must fucking have it out somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's such a good plant, but I've
never been able to find it, but that was
[SPEAKER_02]: like really my, uh, my mom's thing that
she found that was really, really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And other than that, you know,
um, really the only ones I can really
[SPEAKER_02]: remember her talking about was that
original Missouri.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and then knowing that that Northern
lights and she got that Northern lights
[SPEAKER_02]: and a vanilla envelope that just said
Northern light seed bank on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she got those in, in, in 89,
when we lived where the, uh, area 101,
[SPEAKER_02]: where the Emerald cup started now is,
and then we moved and we had a,
[SPEAKER_02]: we had this little shed and she used to
just have like, you know, a little,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little thing with like two, 400 watt
lights or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it just basically kept us from
fucking starving, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, that, that whole era was a lot
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people had had the magic pieces
of property where you wouldn't get busted
[SPEAKER_02]: and you could grow a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people made a lot of money,
but, um, it was hard and it was a
[SPEAKER_02]: completely different thing than people
think of it as.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people thought of good tricks and
some people, you know, were able to do
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom was a single mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had two kids and, uh, you know,
her whole, uh, her whole thing was just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, putting, putting everything on
the line to be able to do that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: She got busted in 1982 with a couple of
small plants on the back porch because a
[SPEAKER_02]: roommate started a big argument with the
fucking landlord and the landlord called
[SPEAKER_02]: the cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he knew there was weed and,
uh, you know, she got locked up in 1982
[SPEAKER_02]: and probably my earliest memory is driving
behind with this lady, Joey in the car,
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at my mom, waving at me from the
back of a cop car on a fucking dirt road,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, not, you know, not the,
uh, not the glorious fucking hand me down,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, type of a lifestyle that
people want to make it out to be when they
[SPEAKER_02]: just show up here to try to fucking make a
quick buck in during the fucking two 15
[SPEAKER_02]: year and then talk down on, on,
on me for being, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the dude who just fucking grew up with
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was from Mendo, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a powerful story about what moms will
go through to follow passion and put food
[SPEAKER_01]: on the table and, you know, major props to
your mom for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, I guess, yeah, continuing on
what you said, that's a bit of a bummer
[SPEAKER_01]: that people assume that just because your
second generation that everything was
[SPEAKER_01]: given to you, it's based on that story.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could almost argue it's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like things are probably a bit harder in
fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's, it's pretty, what it is,
is it's projection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they showed up and everything was
easy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they look at me and they go,
Oh, well, you know, you, things must've
[SPEAKER_02]: been so easy for you cause you showed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even sooner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You showed up after the drug war had
pretty much fucking disappeared from most
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I showed up and turned fucking,
you know, two years old, my mom got
[SPEAKER_02]: arrested and four years old fucking,
you know, camp campaign against marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: planting started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, it's a fucking real
different thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I got buddies who, you know,
we used to, used to go to school,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, or used to go to their house and
I was like, Oh, you know, where's your
[SPEAKER_02]: dad?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Oh, my dad, he's, he's, uh,
you know, he's hiding in Mexico or where's
[SPEAKER_02]: your dad?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he's going to be in jail for fucking
couple of years or, you know, fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it is, you know, like,
Oh, your pop had to, had to fucking log
[SPEAKER_02]: his property and he's still going to do
six years or whatever it is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then dudes show up and fucking make a
bunch of easy money and then want to,
[SPEAKER_02]: want to top shit to, to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're the, you know, we had
everything handed to us on a platter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, you guys didn't even,
you guys didn't even fucking earn,
[SPEAKER_02]: earn shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't make their bones doing shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just showed up carpet bagging and
then talk a bunch of shit, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a bummer to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully this can help shed some
light on that sort of fallacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I definitely took away from that
story that I thought was interesting was
[SPEAKER_01]: how, you know, this amazing Northern
lights that your mom came across,
[SPEAKER_01]: came from some seed stock from like a seed
bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people, including myself
in the past have made the mistake of
[SPEAKER_01]: assuming that all of this sort of
mythical, um, strains and seeds that
[SPEAKER_01]: existed around that area in that time were
like all from like brothers of eternal
[SPEAKER_01]: love and all that sort of mythology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that trope kind of gets
played out a little too much and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: it is a bit less exciting in its origins
and it's just like good stock from a seed
[SPEAKER_01]: bank?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think that the brothers of
eternal love did in fact contribute a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: to the genetics in the scene at that time?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I assume they did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really, um, I don't really know
too much, but I can tell you there's an
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting thing where we, I mean,
imagine back in the day we sir first got
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the mid nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and my buddies are like 14 or 15,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like as a parent, I look at, I look at,
you know, kids, I look at my nine year old
[SPEAKER_02]: and I go, yeah, you tell them things,
but you don't tell them everything,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a natural thing to be like,
yeah, these stories aren't for you to walk
[SPEAKER_02]: around holding.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, it might be kind of heavy,
especially in our day when things were
[SPEAKER_02]: still really considered criminal and you
know, you don't, you don't want to tell
[SPEAKER_02]: your kids like all this heavy duty shit
that you know, they can't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just a disservice in a sense,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So talking to my buddy, um, OG foundation
farms a while back, he's, he's telling me,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I'm talking to him about like
some different strains and he's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, you know, I was talking to,
uh, I was talking to so-and-so and uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, he was, he was not well and I
wanted to know some stories and he was of
[SPEAKER_02]: that older generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I started kind of, you know,
talking to him and digging a little bit to
[SPEAKER_02]: try to, you know, just kind of learn more
and knowing that now it's two grown grown
[SPEAKER_02]: men talking and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he started opening up and saying more,
more of the stories and he ended up saying
[SPEAKER_02]: that like things like what I call what I
call a dirt, which is, um, which is an old
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, yeah, you know, well that came
from, that came from so-and-so,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the computer guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like, oh yeah, yeah,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like back in the day they had
told us, oh, he was the guy who brought
[SPEAKER_02]: the stuff back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we knew that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that had been told to us in the mid
nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, yeah, but you know, what you guys
didn't know, because it's kind of crazy
[SPEAKER_02]: was that he also was one of the guys who
was letting them out in the back of the
[SPEAKER_02]: valley make a lot of acid back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy was like, oh really?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, yeah, you know, the,
the guys who did, who did the sunshine
[SPEAKER_02]: acid, they, they used to make a lot of
that sunshine acid was done out there in
[SPEAKER_02]: the back of the valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh, well that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he's telling them and he goes,
uh, he goes, yeah, you know, they,
[SPEAKER_02]: they, right then around that time,
84 or 83 or whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: whenever it was those seeds showed up and
they told kind of the ladies around here
[SPEAKER_02]: who were growing their like little yard
patches and stuff like, Hey, grow this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and we'll, we'll give you twice what
you're getting now for your other shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll have a lot more weed and it
finishes really quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was kind of the introduction of
like the Afghani, like what we call dirt,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, so interestingly enough,
as much as I don't want to be the guy who
[SPEAKER_02]: jumps on being like, Oh, well the stuff I
have, it came from bowl too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get, it just turned out that really
they did have a hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of had their hand in a lot of
pies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it turned out that the computer guy
had actually got his seed from bowl and,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, and that they had been, they had been
batching up sunshine back his place in
[SPEAKER_02]: the, in the mid eighties, uh, or the early
eighties or whenever, I don't know that
[SPEAKER_02]: the, that the acid and the, I don't know
the timeframe, but that in the same area,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, was these things going on,
you know, which was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he said, yeah, then we took,
we took these big things of seed and we
[SPEAKER_02]: put them inside the tire of our car and
we, and we, we filled up the tires and we,
[SPEAKER_02]: we actually drove me and your dad being my
buddy's dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: We drove to Mexico and we took these seeds
down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the year that Mexican weed,
the price doubled on Mexican weed too,
[SPEAKER_02]: because all of a sudden it was this
chunky, beautiful weed instead of being
[SPEAKER_02]: stringy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, that was really interesting to me
just to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these kinds of trippy stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you talk to people in Humboldt,
they have the same kind of stories where,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, whatever 78, they, these guys
got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then 82, these guys got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, as a younger person,
I would have thought, oh, that's a big
[SPEAKER_02]: span of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I know like the course of six or
eight years or whatever, it's fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's really a trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I can't downplay what they did
because it turns out that even stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: I use came, came from them, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I don't really think that that
adds any value.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the plants have their own value of
whatever their value is, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, uh, I do think that, um,
you know, I think there's certain,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was a very, very, very small world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to this day, it's still a very small
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you get before the internet,
I was talking to somebody today and he
[SPEAKER_02]: goes, man, I had the sour cut in 2003.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it out Branscom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never got another one like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I was like, oh, it's probably the
same one we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think I got mine like 2004 or
something and it's a small area and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's not a lot of people and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, oh, do you know so-and-so?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, yeah, I grew up with his
little brother, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and he has some killer, you know,
SFV diesel seeds now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, oh yeah, that's what he was
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last time I saw him and it's his brother
must've continued it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, yeah, you know, like it's
somebody drops a name and you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, they, I used to, I pulled my groin
muscles sledding down his hill when I hit
[SPEAKER_02]: a fucking stump under the snow,
you know, like in 1988, 1989, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like that's my boy, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's, it's trippy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the, uh, things really are a small
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So somebody like brotherhood of eternal
love who brought in a lot of stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, how many people were circulating
it back then it was, it was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: almost like, um, it was almost like you,
you might be ruining your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime you hand somebody some seeds or,
or a bag of weed back then, that might be
[SPEAKER_02]: it for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be doing 12 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be doing seven years,
you know, like you didn't fucking know
[SPEAKER_02]: back then it was, it was sketchy as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the people who were like that,
they were, um, they were pushing the
[SPEAKER_02]: boundaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't normal fucking guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you can be a normal guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have all kinds of different stuff and
you know, whatever it is, what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure, there's a risk factor there,
but you figure you could probably work it
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back then it was like, no, if you were in
the eighties or the nineties, it was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you, you know, that'd be like right now,
if you're going to, Oh, I'm just going to
[SPEAKER_02]: smuggle to Japan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like how it was just to fucking
tell people in California, you had weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different time, different time indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of that really interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that I kind of wonder about a
bit is often you hear about people
[SPEAKER_01]: reminiscing about strains that used to
exist and maybe they don't exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they exist just in sort of like an S
one of the original sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this all comes to the foreground
because you mentioned sour there for the
[SPEAKER_01]: longest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had the suspicion that the fabled
sour, you hear people talk so fondly about
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly the East coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys who, you know, really just got swept
up in the sour sort of fandom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like the sour that they talk
about, is that one still around or do you
[SPEAKER_01]: think they're just working with S ones or
it's just a case that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the day it was the best there was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there's better, but they still
think like looking back that what they had
[SPEAKER_01]: was better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, because you hear this sort of idea
expressed with a lot of strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think people lose the originals or
it's just like, rose shaded glasses
[SPEAKER_01]: looking back?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think people have the originals,
but so many people don't and think they're
[SPEAKER_02]: the originals that it's hard to make sense
of what's what.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think that Pip from souvenir seeds,
because I've seen crosses that he made
[SPEAKER_02]: with his sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he has the real sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a certain thing about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gassy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a thing to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like you just know that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's so much like the super skunk
that you just kind of know like that's
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you see a lot of people sour and
you go, eh, you know, that just doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's even ones that are not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I haven't seen his sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just seen what came from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can still tell it came from the real
fucking sour because it's just too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's so much more sour than everything
people think is really sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're like, all right,
well, this guy has, you know, even if it
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't even if it wasn't the exact plant,
the phenotype of it, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's it's got to be it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like if I don't know, I just.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just it's just the weed, you know,
it's it's it's skunky ass weed and it and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's really what it should be like,
like the real, real sour stuff that I
[SPEAKER_02]: originally had.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was skunky and metallic and earthy and
it smelled like coffee and it smelled like
[SPEAKER_02]: super skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has like this cushiness to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the same thing you like about O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has some of that and it drops resin and
it gets you high immediately and you feel
[SPEAKER_02]: it in your head and it tastes a certain
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's just certain there's certain
things that sour is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then there's certain things that not
sour are where you're just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's just not sour, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's a type of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my opinion, if you can find the
exact same type of weed, I really don't
[SPEAKER_02]: give a shit if it's the same plant or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's the same type of weed,
what do we care?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like not to say that, not to downplay
provenance and all that, like I care about
[SPEAKER_02]: it myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like the reality of all of it is is
like what's in your bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why I want these particular
plants is because they really are that
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you get a plant and someone says
it's sour and you grow it and you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: wind up with that weed that you expected
and you know what that really is,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's different, then it's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even if the clone was different than
what it was supposed to be and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: actually a one off or an S1 or a cross or
whatever, for the sake of having the weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's the same fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got it right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing that's different,
that's phenotype and that's bulk phenotype
[SPEAKER_02]: or gross phenotype where it's like all
that, it's all the one thing, even if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: a different plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then genotype wise, it's like,
well, if it breeds different, then it's
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a different genotype, but it's the
same phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a weird, that's where you
start to get into that funny genotype
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotype confusion where people don't
know what's what.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, you can have the same
phenotype and go, it's sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is sour, that's sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you S1 both of those plants that
are both exactly like sour and one throws
[SPEAKER_02]: a bunch of shit that's not sour and the
other throws all sour, that's where you
[SPEAKER_02]: have your different genotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where it actually counts in the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as people cloning something and
being like, oh, don't call it a phenotype,
[SPEAKER_02]: call it a genotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, every plant is a genotype
and a phenotype, but what are we talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you might not be even talking about
something where you need to even use those
[SPEAKER_02]: words.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just call it a fucking plant or a type or
a throw or you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's where it really comes down to
it for me is like, if I want to smoke it,
[SPEAKER_02]: I only need the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I'm going to breed it and say it's
the original and that's what's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: get preserved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what's going to get spread and
you know, the provenance and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you need that genotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to be what's inside of it that it
actually possesses for its progeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when genotype counts, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And uh, so, you know, like I said,
is it, is it really, do people really have
[SPEAKER_02]: it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but if people have it and it
really breeds that way where things come
[SPEAKER_02]: out of it that are the real deal,
like that's all you really need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you know, I mean, the coolest
thing is if you know, like somebody's
[SPEAKER_02]: like, yeah, I popped the seed and this is
the real one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always been in my hands and you know,
but um, other than that, there's really no
[SPEAKER_02]: way to verify a cut without having it
without being able to go, I gave it to
[SPEAKER_02]: someone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they never got another thing similar to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave it to someone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that person never got another thing
similar to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave it to this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He never had something similar to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can get it back and know it's
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you gave a sour, if you popped the
sour from seed and you gave it to this guy
[SPEAKER_02]: and he's like, yeah, I had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I bred it and I kept this one and
it was like sour, but it was even bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kept that one, but I kept the
original.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then at one point, I think I mixed
them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you've already lost it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've lost your provenance and you don't
really know, you don't really know shit
[SPEAKER_02]: because you could have a plant that the
phenotypes exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it ain't actually the same genotype
because a different fucking plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all, it's all, it's all an
interesting, interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole sour thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there's so many sour cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then was the one I got in the early
two thousands, was it ever the real one?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but it's what I consider the
real one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I see people with something
that's like that, or that has tons of that
[SPEAKER_02]: super skunk smell that I knew from the
super skunk that my buddy got from his
[SPEAKER_02]: buddy's back, cause he had it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he got it back from his buddies
in Arcata in the late nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the super skunk I know to be
skunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't even know, is that the super
skunk that, that everyone else is talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about when they talk about the,
the mass or the, the six or I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know that's the one that I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I smell really good diesel,
if it smells like that, then I think of it
[SPEAKER_02]: as being real diesel, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what the LA Cush headband,
that's what the real sour they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: That smell from that super skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the difference between them and super
skunk is super skunk tasted great,
[SPEAKER_02]: smelled great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't really that gnarly a weed,
but it was really tasty and enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_02]: The real good headband and sour were like,
the sour would get you really high and it
[SPEAKER_02]: was clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: The headband would just fuck you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can get really high off of that
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you didn't have a real strong tolerance
to those kinds of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, those are, those are the
cool ones to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you bring all that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I mean, a lot of it, obviously
really valid points and on the topic of
[SPEAKER_01]: like strains that people may or may not
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you referenced the skunk in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed on a recent CSI Humboldt post of
all things seeing as we've already
[SPEAKER_01]: referenced old inspector that there was a
post about roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed a comment you left there
saying that the skunkiest thing you had
[SPEAKER_01]: smelled in a while was a strain called
death coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually hadn't come across that one
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me a little bit about that
one?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one that comes from those seeds
that, that souvenir seeds made.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I grew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my, what I call grape lime skunk,
which I'm not going to say is roadkill
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk, but that's the one that like,
you know, like I don't, not to like just
[SPEAKER_02]: put it out there just like as a,
as a name drop, but like skunk VA had the
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk back in the day for a long time,
grew it, knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said that the grape lime skunk had
that smell in it with other smells,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course, which is what I think too,
but that it was the closest he'd smell
[SPEAKER_02]: since he had smelled that stuff in the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had that, I had a cut that is
supposed to be death star, whether it is
[SPEAKER_02]: or not, I don't know, but it's very,
very skunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a sour diesel cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some sour diesel back cross twos
that I got from skunk tech that were
[SPEAKER_02]: popped from Karma seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some other stuff, you know,
some pretty funky stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And breaking down, taking the seeds out of
the death coast was like burnt garlic,
[SPEAKER_02]: burnt rubber, coffee, onion, skunk,
just funky super skunk as much as I can
[SPEAKER_02]: remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just smelled like super skunk to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what I called what, like what I
called pissy pungent back in the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a little different, but like really,
really what I know to be what I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never smelled that was what I ever
thought was the skunkiest weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that I believe was a death star
cross sour diesel, or it might've been a
[SPEAKER_02]: sensei star cross sour diesel,
a remake of the death star cross,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's one of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was nasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got some weed from the same guy
and it was what he calls rubber city.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rubber city, I believe is the
death star cross with the sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the death coast is the sour cross
sensei star.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the rubber city, I think is three
quarters sour and the, and the death coast
[SPEAKER_02]: is half, but I'm not sure about that,
but that's, that's how I remember it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be the opposite, but it's,
it's, it's just, it's, it's skunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's just the skunkiest shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you want skunky stuff and I
haven't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen other stuff that I,
that I would say really smells like skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't grown everybody's so-called
skunk, but when I ask people when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: growing it out, kind of everybody's like,
Oh, so-and-so said it's skunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not skunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, okay, well there,
there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said it's not skunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you seem, you know, CSI on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I don't know if there's a way
to make them skunky, but they ain't
[SPEAKER_02]: skunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't, you know, I don't really know,
you know, I don't know what to make of all
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but that, that stuff is, that's bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I would recommend if people want
something skunky, get those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think people have this weird
thing of, of wanting like something to
[SPEAKER_02]: appear.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be like, literally smell
like a dead skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen thousands and thousands of
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from back in the day when skunk was
really common, we didn't even really think
[SPEAKER_02]: much of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't ever really smell anything
that was more like a dead skunk than like
[SPEAKER_02]: super skunk or death coast, or,
you know, like this grape lime skunk thing
[SPEAKER_02]: that I have, which I would say is,
is, is way not as skunky as death coast,
[SPEAKER_02]: but which is, it has another little depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dimension to it, which is kind of this wet
dog coffee thing that I get from when I
[SPEAKER_02]: smell a real skunk spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I had a house where there was a,
there was a place where like some,
[SPEAKER_02]: some wiring got off of one of the holes
and I had a skunk go under my house and
[SPEAKER_02]: spray my house twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, I'm very familiar with a skunk,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in a car.
[SPEAKER_02]: That went over a skunk that was an old car
that was pretty rickety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sprayed us directly under the car
and like your eyes burn and there's
[SPEAKER_02]: certain smells and like those particular
smells, there's these certain aspects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And mine, I wouldn't say is the intense,
like dead skunk like that, but it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it has some, it has those things that I
think make up that smell, but I'm still,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still not like, this is the smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the fucking roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never saw anything called roadkill skunk
in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a lot of fucking weed, but I didn't
see everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I, you know, I, I questioned a little
bit this whole, I questioned the whole,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, hunt for it a little bit and
think that weed smells a lot skunkier to
[SPEAKER_02]: you when you don't have very much weed,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of, a lot of
different angles we could work that one
[SPEAKER_01]: from, but I'm glad you brought it up that
the, the grape lime skunk of yours,
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember still to this day, you know,
being at Emerald Cup and you gave me that
[SPEAKER_01]: bud to smell and I took it over to Skunk
VA and we both immediately agreed that was
[SPEAKER_01]: the most insane skunk turps we'd ever
smelled in a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any plans to try to lock that
one down in seed form at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, whether it be just, you know,
to do the F1s, which was what I kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: smelled or to line work it, to back cross
it, anything sort of like that up your
[SPEAKER_01]: sleeve?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so I had that one and it was funny
because I only had one plant of it and it
[SPEAKER_02]: was this gorgeous plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I ran through a bunch more and I found
some nice ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I let out a little bit of F2s of those
from a nice grape skunky one with a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: the grape funk to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from those same males that I
pulled out of those, I put those back on
[SPEAKER_02]: the lime one and I put out a little bit of
that as lime one back cross because it was
[SPEAKER_02]: lime one cross grape soda skunk was what
the grape lime skunk clone was that you
[SPEAKER_02]: smelled.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I took its brother and put that back on
two twin brothers actually and put that
[SPEAKER_02]: back on the lime one for lime one back
cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that wasn't so much shooting for the
skunk side as it was shooting for more of
[SPEAKER_02]: the lime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I did, I made F3s with everything
that I got that was real stable out of
[SPEAKER_02]: those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there's maybe eight of those,
three different males done separately in
[SPEAKER_02]: that breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them that was just very loud skunk
plant the whole plant just smelled really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really skunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two more that smelled a little bit more
like the original grape lime skunk clone
[SPEAKER_02]: that you saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I took that original grape lime skunk
clone that you saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: I crossed it with three different males
separately.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's three different lines back
crossed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made F3s with three different males
separately.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's I guess maybe there's 10 lines
of it in F3 now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eight of which are with my favorite male,
two of which are with the females that
[SPEAKER_02]: matched the other two males I kept most
closely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just an attempt to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gave those actually to skunk VA
because he said he'd pop them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know he knows skunk turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we'll see if he finds
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, if he doesn't, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if he does, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had the F2s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything that didn't smell where the
whole plant didn't smell like a skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave them to one of my buddies and he
put them in like 200 gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I gave him 30 of them,
maybe 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went out and checked on them when
they were really chunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them had some colas that were
like damn near like loaves of bread,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were huge fucking colas where you're
like that's got to be rotten.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they weren't because it just has
really the grape and the lime both have
[SPEAKER_02]: great mold resistance because they're
based on old gorilla strains, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And out of those 25 that I thought
wouldn't be skunky, there were probably
[SPEAKER_02]: five or seven that were like really
skunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh shit, that's skunky bud,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then out of the ones that I kept that
were the ones that I really liked the
[SPEAKER_02]: most, which I think was 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of mine was the same deal,
probably the same, only the same ratio,
[SPEAKER_02]: which means that the whole plant smelling
like a skunk doesn't necessarily determine
[SPEAKER_02]: whether or not the flower is going to
smell like a skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of shit to keep track of
because some strains the stem rub means a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot and some it means less.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means that just because the males
I kept were skunky doesn't mean they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily throw skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I back cross now to the one you
smelled and then I'll plant that and out
[SPEAKER_02]: of those I'll find something that's the
closest to it and I'll back cross to it
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I'd like to see is that the back
cross has more of that plant in it than
[SPEAKER_02]: the F2s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it doesn't, then I'll try another
back cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it doesn't increase at that point,
then it's kind of an indication that that
[SPEAKER_02]: plant doesn't like to breed true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could also mean that I'm just not
picking the right males.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's pretty, you know, like you want
to see when you back cross to something
[SPEAKER_02]: that the frequency of that type goes up
fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it doesn't, then it makes you know
that you're probably better off going F2,
[SPEAKER_02]: F3, F4 rather than going back on a back
cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's my experimentation
with it at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are growing out the back cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are growing out the F3s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we'll see what works out of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cool thing is I have the clone,
you know, so I have a plant that smells
[SPEAKER_02]: like that weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, you know, I'd like to see it in
seed form.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to take that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to take that and say,
oh, yeah, you only have to grow six six
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking packs to get one that smells like
this and then put skunk on the label.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like, doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll call, I can call it grape,
lime, skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a grape, lime and skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if it can get to the point
where it's skunky, skunky, that would be,
[SPEAKER_02]: that would be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I took that too and I crossed it
with a death star because the death star
[SPEAKER_02]: was really skunky, almost as skunky as the
death coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And out of that, there might be more
skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, I feel like that's cheating a
little bit because it's using super skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: from the diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I what I want to do is bring skunk out
of the old Afghani stuff that's in the
[SPEAKER_02]: grape and the lime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just it's more of a kind of like a
challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the meantime, I don't mind doing
doing a cheat and just seeing if that will
[SPEAKER_02]: make it work too, you know, because they
both if they both have it coming from both
[SPEAKER_02]: sides, you might get a lot more of it
should get a quarter taken to two things
[SPEAKER_02]: that have it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not necessarily true because it
might not be frequent at all in the gene
[SPEAKER_02]: group, but we'll find out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the that's the that's where I
went with that this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, a question which kind of stems
off what you were just talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'll make it a little more
hypothetical so that hopefully it makes it
[SPEAKER_01]: easier to answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say someone out there who's
listening has managed to find themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've made a cross and they've been
hunting the seeds and they find one plant
[SPEAKER_01]: in those seeds, which is totally unlike
the mother or the father, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like let's say mom's mango dad's OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's blueberry, you know, like it's just
really left a field to both parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're really not sure what traits are
coming from what parent because it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: that really unique sort of phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you try to line work that or back
across it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how would you go about trying to lock
in that super, super unique phenotype?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it be trial and error?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think for those super like one
in a thousand phenos, it's probably
[SPEAKER_01]: actually not very easy to get that into
then a seed form?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, some people won't like to hear it,
but the way that you really want to do
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that is you want to take that
blueberry plant and self it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find the same exact plant again,
even if it was out of one out of a
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand, when you self it, it should be a
little more frequent than one out of a
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you want to grow those out,
find the plant that's the same again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have to self that one again,
every time you self, you're going to lock
[SPEAKER_02]: it down more and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, you can take that
blueberry plant and take a male out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: same cross and go and breed to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that and, you know, make your,
make your F3 and then take your F3 male
[SPEAKER_02]: that you think is the closest to the
blueberry plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it back on the blueberry and then hope
you get some blueberries out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then out of those seeds, find the one
that's the closest once again and go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you see that you're starting
to get more blueberries every time,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can just continue black, you can
continue back crossing to the blueberry,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, until you want, until it winds
up being, you know, really frequent and
[SPEAKER_02]: you just get a lot of blueberry in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then at that point would be where it would
be better to breed it forward because you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you, you, you're basically targeting in,
you know, you're getting it to the point
[SPEAKER_02]: where there's more and more and more of
this one thing that you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then, you know, if that,
if that didn't work at all, then like I
[SPEAKER_02]: said, you know, selfing it, is really the
best way because if you get one out of a
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand is blueberry, then you self it
and you get one out of whatever that next
[SPEAKER_02]: time, but you find that one out of the S
ones and you self that one and you find
[SPEAKER_02]: that same one out of the S two,
by the time you make the S three or the S
[SPEAKER_02]: four, you're going to have something where
that's what it has.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just mostly all blueberry,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So then.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, you might be better off
crossing to the S three or the S two or
[SPEAKER_02]: the S one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be better back crossing to that
lots of times because it might be a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: more, um, true breeding, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, there's just a question
of finding those, those right things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, as far as like modern breeders
would look for, they'd look for whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: those genes are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just go, okay, we're just going to
test this plant and see if it's the right
[SPEAKER_02]: one, test a thousand males and find the
one that actually has those same genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how you would do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were like a real, um, you know,
a real breeder in the, in the most
[SPEAKER_02]: advanced sense of, of the, of the,
of the, you know, discipline or the job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you know, in reality, if you were
somebody like, if you were big agriculture
[SPEAKER_02]: and you want this crop to get ready and
you want to be able to go, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to get this into seed form as
quick as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would self, self, self, self,
self.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you would, you would, you would make
the S one, then you would find the exact
[SPEAKER_02]: same plant may be improved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to settle for one that's
not, you don't want to settle for one
[SPEAKER_02]: that's worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you want to take that S one and
you want to sell fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you want to find one of the S
twos that maybe is a little bit improved
[SPEAKER_02]: or maybe a lot improved if you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you want to make the S three.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, by the time you get
something to be in like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: five generations, seven generations of
selfing, that's what they're really
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they tell you about a true inbred
line, there's different ways to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to, to define an inbred line or an IBL,
but like in a most true, true sense,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would be like selfing for several
generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you could get to the point where
you basically had to clone in seed form,
[SPEAKER_02]: where the plant would be exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you just bat cross seven times and
the plant you were bat crossing to doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: ever want to be super, it doesn't want to
be the only thing in the mix anyway,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it already has a, it's coming from
a diverse gene pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you sometimes will make it work,
but it's more likely that you won't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll wind, what you'll wind up with
is the same gene pool that came from just
[SPEAKER_02]: coming back again and again, as if it's an
S one, because S ones aren't really
[SPEAKER_02]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bat crosses aren't necessarily consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: S ones are very consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they came out, if you take an S one out
of something that's already super
[SPEAKER_02]: consistent, yeah, then you get what people
think an S one is, but that's not the case
[SPEAKER_02]: when you, when you S one something from a
really inconsistent gene pool or where you
[SPEAKER_02]: bat cross to one plant from a really
inconsistent gene pool, unless you get
[SPEAKER_02]: lucky and all the traits that you wanted
from that plant happened to be dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it doesn't matter if it was
inconsistent because dominant traits are
[SPEAKER_02]: just going to want to pop out frequently,
you know, more than other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to kind of, you have to kind
of play with them to know exactly what the
[SPEAKER_02]: individual is you're working with to know
if it's just going to throw everything you
[SPEAKER_02]: want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you might bat cross, bat cross,
bat cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then turns out, well, now you've just
made a super consistent strain,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it has one thing locked in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't get rid of like it's sexually
unstable or it's prone to a disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hadn't even, maybe you didn't even
have that disease and now you get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go fuck the whole population gets it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas that the S ones from that plant
might not even had that because you still
[SPEAKER_02]: had some variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, you know, I don't know,
there's, there's a lot of different,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of different ways to go with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what's so trippy about anytime
you want to work with something is you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't, you don't necessarily know what's
the best way to do it without trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why it's really good if you're
going to work with things to work with
[SPEAKER_02]: things you really like, because if you're
going to wind up having a lot of failures,
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to have failures on your way to
something that means something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of having a bunch of failures on
your way to something where, even if it
[SPEAKER_02]: works perfect, you don't even,
you don't not even going to value it that
[SPEAKER_02]: much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's where I work with your
favorite stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you fuck up or you waste time or you
do the wrong thing and now you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: start over, you're still excited,
you know, cause if you just follow in
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you're trying to chase,
you're trying to make RKS cause RKS is hot
[SPEAKER_02]: right now, you know, you know,
let RKS pop up for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And see if it stays popular after a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are going, that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, you know, it's actually not
really, I mean, and then in back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: day, a lot of stuff was skunky and we
didn't even, we weren't even that excited
[SPEAKER_02]: about it unless it was like what I said,
like the pissy pungent or the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the super skunk where it actually smokes
good and translates just smelling like a
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't, it, the weed also has to be
enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have a good high and tastes good and
burn right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully grow good and yield well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, like I, like what is RKS
rosin tastes like?
[SPEAKER_02]: It might fucking tastes like nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody even knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole new generation of,
of, of uses for stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, make sure you like something
before you go fucking chasing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause everyone's talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there you have it gang.
