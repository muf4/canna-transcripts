Good evening everybody and welcome to another exciting episode of the Calyx and
Crew podcast. Before we get started don't forget to follow us on patreon over at
Doc Calyx. We've got plenty of entertainment, game shows, giveaways and
all kinds of good stuff. You also get to meet with these breeders, question them,
whoever we have as guests on our podcast. We try to invite over to our discord so
you can go ask them one-on-one questions if you want to and you get tons of other
goodies. It's just a great experience overall. Before we get started I want to
give a huge shout out to Stoner Days Apparel. You guys can go over to shop.stonerdays.com

whopping 20% off your order. I'm very excited about today's episode. We have
Sunleaf on the other line. He's gonna be talking about some of the methods that
he uses to repopulate land races. He's gonna talk about that Sinai that I grew,
that beautiful Egyptian land race. We're gonna talk about replicating
environments with some of these land races as well as Sunleaf's intuition of
getting into growing, what got him into breeding and where he sees Sunleaf Seed
Company going in the future. We appreciate having him on. We got him on
the other line right now so let's just jump in the episode. Sunleaf, how you
doing my brother? Doing well. Good. Thanks for having me on. Absolutely, thanks for coming on. So before we really get deep into
things, I wanted to reiterate for people that may not be acquainted with Sunleaf
Seed Company, who are you? Where are you from? What are you all about? Well, we're
based out of Colorado primarily right now. We've done a lot of multi-state work over the past few years.
But what we're all about is breeding seed for everybody basically. We want to
encompass the market, being able to have high CBD, THC seeds, strains that will be good for
people who are, you know, some of these new seeds coming up, you don't have people
who are wanting to smoke 30% THC strains. So we have some stuff that, you know, you
would consider, would be considered mid as far as the market would go as far as THC
testing. But people still really like it. We also have those really great high
testing THC strains and land-raised strains, which we really, those ones we
really hope here because of preservation, you know, as legalization worldwide
becomes more prevalent. These kind of old strains that have been the background to
all of our creation can get lost with all the pollen contamination and huge hemp
fields actually that have been authorized to grow in our country and
other countries as well. It's really been one of those rushes to people to
preserving these heirlooms. So that is a lot of what we do is preservation, preservation
breeding and breeding hybrids that, mainly like breeding hybrids, I like to smoke.
You know, in turn, a lot of other people like to smoke too. So that's kind of where we're at
with our breeding. I like to make some concerns, but you know, I don't want to, other than
autopower, we haven't really dove into that yet.
Right. So, well, that's, you know, I appreciate you mentioning that because a lot of people don't
mention that. We talk about land-raises a lot on my show. We talk about land-raises
a lot on the live shows as well. But one of the things that doesn't get brought
up very often is why it's important to preserve these genetics, that they are
going away, that there is climate and environmental factors that are eroding
and taking away some of these populations. So, with that respect...
Yeah, it's essential for them to be watered down, you know, or get crops pollinated.
And, you know, these farmers aren't, these farmers don't have a lot of money for these areas.
And, you know, they're making seeds for their next season consistently.
So, pollination, contaminated crop, you know, it could be a devastating thing.
And it forever changed the variety.
Absolutely.
Yeah, it's something that we feel is important.
But also, it's really great for people to play with too. It's really interesting.
But that's not all what you do. You don't strictly do preservation efforts, right?
No. I do like to make polyhybrids and modern-style hybrids, you know.
And what's your goal with that?
High THC and the effect.
You know, obviously, we're breeding for, you know, when you're breeding for production,
which is what I would consider like modern day flowers, you know, most people want from a finished yield.
So, you know, these are all second-hand things I consider.
You know, like, of course, I want to breed for yield and quality.
So, it's kind of given that when we're working these modern lines, like,
the goals we're trying to achieve is, you know, high THC, a bag of steel, yield.
You know, these are all things that benefit the farmer.
So, that's another thing, you know, that's second-hand.
It's like we're all about the farmers, you know, the growers.
And really trying to elevate strains to the point where, you know,
if you've ever grown some of these varieties that have been hyped up,
you'd be like, oh, yeah, it's really great, but it doesn't yield very much.
You know, you wouldn't do a whole garden of it, you know.
So, these are the kind of things we're trying to do with our breeding
to kind of bring up, bring lines up to production lines.
So, not only are you preserving some of these land races,
but you're trying to work them into modern hybrids.
So, people get what they want out of, you know, what they see,
one of the more modern cultivars, but incorporating the medicinal benefits
of those land races into that.
Yeah.
That's awesome.
You know, there is a split between, you know, we work quite a few projects.
And I do have lots of F1 hybrids.
I would call them like very similar to true F1s,
where you're taking two inbred lines and breeding them together
and that's about being very uniform.
But what you'll find with our direct land race hybrid,
they're very, very uniform, just like an F1 would be.
And these ones, you're going to find the most medicinal properties.
You will find some lean towards the land race,
some lean towards the modern cultivar,
because typically I like to cross them to a modern cultivar.
And that really kind of helps out that modern cultivar gene pool.
And what you can do is work that line and go through and select
and then you can do some breeding towards, you know, whatever you're looking for.
But it's very medicinal.
Like these strains that we're working that are land race hybrids,
they're very medicinal properties.
They don't have very high THC, most of them.
But they're really great.
They're really great for breeding.
They will take qualities that you don't see in the modern cultivars
like pest resistance and mildew and mold resistance, you know,
and be able to bump that up.
So it's like a stepping stone a lot of some of the work we're doing
is creating stepping stones that, you know,
cutting out some of the work that you don't have to do.
But so you can, you know, pick up where we started it.
And that's another one of our goals is, you know,
get people into breeding their own seeds
and using tools like land race genetics
to be able to, you know, help them breed stuff
that isn't going to,
that is going to be successful for them, you know,
for whatever their goal is, you know,
making an auto flower or, you know,
maybe making something more medicinal, you know.
Absolutely.
That kind of stuff.
That's awesome.
We do have a couple different styles of breeding.
We do the strictly land race breeding
where we're preserving land race.
We do the land race hybridization
where we're using modern cultivars with the land race.
And then I'm doing the normal style breeding
where we're doing polyhybrids,
modern cultivars, modern cultivars.
Some of these lines I've worked quite extensively
and then I'll talk them to the modern cultivars.
You'll see in some of our feeds
that it really brings up the yield
and size of the trichomes.
So it's really like a guided work on some of the lines
to be able to do that.
That's awesome, man.
We really respect you for doing that too.
What are, you know,
one of the things I like to ask all my guests,
especially my guests that are breeders,
is out of all the work that you've ever done,
what types have you made
that you say represent your work the best?
You know, actually,
I would have to say
that some of the stuff that I don't consistently grow,
it would be the land race hybrid.
Just because it seems like people get so much joy
out of growing them
and it makes me feel good that I made them.
You know, to make other people happy.
But just the fact that
they're so unique
and you don't see a lot of people doing that
these days.
And, yeah.
Out of those land race hybrids,
which one of them would you say is your favorite?
Wow.
They're all unique in their own way.
To be honest,
you know,
each one has its own different qualities.
That's what's so special about these plants.
You know, you go
the Lebanese is going to be so CBD rich.
It's got very,
I wouldn't say very low,
but moderately low CBC
and even in some of the phenotypes
that you can find,
these are really great medicinal plants.
And then you go over just a little bit
to the Egyptian
and all of a sudden,
there's no CBD
nearly.
And it's much higher CBC
and it's all bred for a fact.
You know?
I gotta tell you, that makes me really, really happy
because that Sinai
just got done curing up
and we were going to smoke some of it for the first time
this Sunday.
Oh, yeah.
We can do that. We can arrange that.
It is really interesting.
I don't want to say what the effect is.
I don't know if I talked to you the last time
about the effect or you might have.
You haven't, really.
The main reason I was chasing
that Sinai
was for that granule terpene.
I was looking through different
cultivars that were high in the granule
and Sinai popped up and then I saw that you had it
and I was like, well, hell,
Yeah, and did you get any terpene tested?
I did not get them tested.
I test with my nose because I am a home
hobby road.
But I can say
they all had a very,
very granule smell
to them.
They had heavy, heavy floral rose scents.
It was fairly
inbred.
Some of them had like a musky,
skunky spiciness to them
but they all seemed to carry
that floral scent. There was one
that really, really stuck out to me
and I did a small pollination
on that one and it
definitely carried what I would say
was a peach essence
and that's why I was stoked to
not only keep those seeds around and go
through them but go through those
Petri-Rex crosses that you sent me
with the Sinai.
Oh yeah, you're going to like those.
Speaking of those Petri-Rex
those are probably the peachiest
of the market right now.
If anybody goes out
and grabs any of the peach stuff
or if you're into peaches
you can find my Peach Cobbler
or the Violet Peach.
I don't want to say I have one for
someone but
it's probably the most unique peach
I've ever worked with like nothing else.
It's all coming off that peach grass.
That's awesome.
It's really great.
That's exactly how I would describe
the terpene
if you were to ask me.
It smells like a musky rose
or like floral
and then I've had people say
mango, you found one
that said
what did you say it was? Peach?
So I could totally see that.
I've actually seen some of the hybrids
that I've made with it
those terpenes come out even more.
It's definitely
reminiscent of stone fruit.
We can sum it up to that.
Like the apricot, mango, peach
like stone fruit.
Yeah, totally.
And so
what I was speaking on that is
how unique they are.
You go from one location to the next
it's totally different.
The Pakistani that I have
is
very like
I want to say
earthy, burning fire,
very
much for like
for getting stone.
So all of these are like different
tools that people can use
and access and that was one of the reasons
that we put
our seeds, our land rights
at 24 paths
24 seeds per path
so you get enough to play with
you might find some auto flowers
and that can, that diverges into
the way that we do the breeding
you know, I'm not doing
any sort of inbreeding
where we're selecting one male and one female
I'm leaving the population
very open
so that you can
see what they were
working with
over, you know, in the field
and
you'll have all that genetic
information
to be able to pull from
you'll find some
that might have an auto flower trait
you'll find some that might be stretchier
might be more vigorous
or less leafy
leaf to calyx ratio
so we've tried to leave
everything in there
so obviously we've pulled anything out
that had undesirable traits
like from aphrodisiac
you can only do so much
when we're talking about
and this is another thing that I've noticed
when we're talking about something
that grows where they're
putting very little influence into the ground
and you take it and you give it
everything it needs or everything
we think it needs and it's way too much
for it
it is one of those things where
you do have to, to say it lightly
you can't treat it like a
modern cook-a-bar
pound a bunch of food into it
but I haven't seen people do it
so we are trying to
remove problematic
genotypes
when they arise
but we can only
do so much
so you do have to take things
I would say like with the grain of salt
you definitely don't need to
use as much food as you would
Right
well that's one of the things about
replicating the environment
is you're
trying to replicate
in a way their environment
because you can't treat them like
modern polyhybrids right
some of them like it a little bit drier
some of them like it a little bit wetter
some of them don't like any nutrition
they're used to growing up in sandy soil
while others are used to growing
in very very nutrient rich
yeah and I've seen that
you can take some of these
and grow them
in different environments
I've seen people take the Pakistani
and grow it in Hawaii
and do actually do inbreeding
projects with it where they've been
selecting the male and female
that do the best
for four seasons
and now everything that comes out
of that
is really great
it's climatized
it's still Pakistani
but it's in Hawaii
there's lots of work that people can do
the main thing is that we were just
trying to make access for it
I'm not trying to
lay claim to any of these
heirlooms
or land races
I just wanted to give people access
in North America
that was our original idea
let's order a bunch
from overseas
let's get some from private collectors
let's do repopulation
of moderate size
25 plus males and females
and
make them available
in North America
one of the worst things
and
biggest decision
seed buying is that
having to order from overseas
is always a drag
you might lose your order
to customs
that was the whole thing
that whole barrier
that whole process
give Americans
and people in North America
access to
land races
without having to order from overseas
and wait two or three weeks
to get them
that was the whole idea of that
it was just access
we appreciate and we respect that
I can tell you firsthand
that I've had plenty of packages
and then you don't get your seeds
and fuck there goes your money
yeah and
that's the other thing too
is where you have orders from overseas
and sometimes those seed banks
will give you a refund
or they'll re-send them
but they might not be the same seed
it's always a risk
and that was one of the things
we wanted to give people access
and we thought that was really important
genetic information
did you say that was a big push
of what got you into breeding?
no
what was it that got you into breeding first?
what got me into breeding was
just that there was nothing
that
there wasn't a lot of stuff in North America
at the time that we were
growing
and what you could find
was very limited
and it wasn't always very good
and when we did order
it was always a risk
the reason we started breeding
was because there was
not very good access
so our idea was
to just start breeding on our own
for us
and that's what we did for several years
I started growing
in 2008
we didn't start breeding
until 2011
I was working with a partner
and met him
about 2010
we started breeding
we were growing together
we started breeding in 2011
and
the reason we started breeding
was just to make our own feed
because we were just dissatisfied with everything
we were getting
so that was kind of the first
the idea of preserving stuff
came later
after we had decided
let's incorporate
some land races
let's incorporate some stability
back into these lines
so that's when we started
to order stuff
from overseas
middle east
India
wherever we could find collectors
who were
able to travel at the time
it's hard to think back
people were able to travel after
we did two sheds for a whole year
we would get them from collectors
from different areas
or a feed bank
from different areas
from Europe
so
before all of this
you were still in Colorado
when you began growing for the first time?
yeah
awesome, so you're a lifetime
yeah
yeah I
Oregon is
a state that we associate with
pretty heavily
and
actually you're going to see us pop up
there a lot more in 2021
but I do have
growing experience in southern Oregon
where we're growing outside
in 200 gallon pots
the climate there is very different
people think of Oregon as being
rainy
and humid all the time
but Oregon is dry
it's like 100 degrees
it's like eastern and western Washington
I've never really been to Washington other than Seattle
so
I have no idea
direct opposite of Seattle
sagebrush and cactuses
really? ok
yeah so
I've got a few
experience growing in a few
regions
obviously
when you're inside you can control your environment
much easier
but even
depending on where you're at
there's going to be different pressures
that you have when you're setting up
and controlling the environment
yeah we've got multi-state
experience
and
we're continually expanding
as legalization
keeps going
very awesome
what would you say is the number one strain
that you sell out of the fastest?
the number one?
you know
I wouldn't say I have
a number one strain
that sells out the fastest
but I do have some stuff
that seems to really hit
it all seems to be whatever the flavor is
banana
seems to be really popular right now
we've got a lot of people picking up
the raspberry banana
an all time favorite
typically
that everybody
seems to like
is coffee
so we've
did a little bit of work
with chai as coffee
I would just say it really depends
on whatever is off of it
I had some strains about
4 years ago
and I put them on the menu
and they were really great strains
they weren't popular 2 years ago
but for some reason
people are scooping them up really quick
this year
so it just seems like whatever flavor
people are into
I'm trying to breed
not just what I like
I'll throw some stuff in there
that I don't necessarily like to smoke
something like toffee canna
which is a serpentine
that I'm not super fond of
like jelly bean, pancake
tangerine flavor
I'm not really fond of it
but it's really popular
for other people
I make seeds for people
so I gotta make what they like
so one of the
strains that really brought
Sunleaf Seed Company to my attention
that I heard a ton of people raving about
was the Unleaded
what's that all about?
the Unleaded is great
it's an ice cream shake
topped with my blacktop
and the blacktop is the sour diesel
Nigerian spread
that's why
yeah and that is really
the blacktop is really great
the blacktop is actually
a strain that I acquired
from other breeders in Oregon
who
they retraded it
and
the funny story on the blacktop really quick
is actually I went to one of these
home growers' hubs in Oregon
dispensaries
were there
home growers were there
everybody was there
handing out flowers to each other
basically
somebody gave me
a couple buds of this
and it had 10 seeds, 15 seeds in it
it was the best flower
that I'd ever seen
out of everything
and it was black and red
and the guy was like
oh we're calling it
blacktop
because it's like asphalt
it had been bred
for several seasons
with the selection being
for sour flavor
with the Nigerian buds
and a very cool head effect
like headbang
and so
we grew it out
and we continued to work with it
and everything
that it touches seems to
bump up the resin head size
bump up the yield from top to bottom
it adds a sour flavor
and it'll add that
uplifting tequila
buzz to it
so it kind of overpowers
it leaves really
good trace of the mom
like I said
it bumps up the yield
so when we swapped that
for the ice cream cake
it was just putting out stuff
that was like Coke bottles
and I handed out a few
of them to a few people
and some people got some good pictures
of them
but that's the main thing
I think that's going to be a big one
once more people get to see it
fill the soil
doing a whole 2x2 tent
with one plant in it
and I wish him
all the luck
but I hope it doesn't stretch too much
because that thing is going to yield a lot
he actually messaged me
and told me he's yielded more
than he thinks he's ever grown
Awesome. We're going to take a quick break
we'll be right back with Sunleaf Seed Company
Alright we are back with Sunleaf Seed Company
before we left
we were talking about some of his methods
with repopulating these land races
some of the cultivars that he works with
not only is he doing preservation efforts
but he's working on true hybrids
and he's working on polyhybrids as well
he's also
doing a lot of fem work now
and we're going to jump into that
we're going to be talking about
how he feminizes seeds
what he's been working on
but first we went through
and we dug out
our peach pheno of the cyani
I've been saying that wrong forever
cyani
I need to nail that in my head
but we found the peach pheno
I've got some loaded up and we're going to do a live review
Cheers
Cheers, that sounds good
Right
well I'll talk about the effect real quick
you're going to go through a portal
no I'm just kidding
the effect is very similar from what I've reviewed
to
similar to headband almost
where you'll feel it in your forehead
almost like your third eye
really really weird
that is wonderful
that is wonderful
you know the flavor isn't overwhelming
but it's not
it's not watered down
it's not there
it's just a very very
it's not an offensive one so it doesn't stick out
but it's very very clean
very even
it's just a fresh clean flavor
really
yeah you know
and that's one of the things
some of us younger people
that's nice
that's beautiful
before the major prohibitions
were so spoiled
you know
you can smoke some of these land races
to where they
and it's always disappointing
to throw it for 8 or 9 weeks
I love it
you know
that one is really
I kind of want the ones that are going to be
that you're going to want to work with
you can tell it's something
that's not going to knock you out
but flavor
we'll see effect in a little bit
but flavor right off the bat
clean burn, beautiful, smooth
I would say that
that's kind of what's leaning into
that clean taste
that floral essence
to it
it's light and it's nice
you can taste it after
a couple minutes
yeah it's not getting super
it's not overload with resin
to be able to get too ashy
yeah
yeah that's a good one
it's a really great hybrid
I'm excited that you made some hybrids
I actually I did
the open pollination of the phenotypes
that I like the most
and you know what I was seeing
in that cyania population
it is very inbred
there's not a lot of variation
but there was some that were taller
with longer inter-notal spacing
and then there was some that were really
like you said it was a pretty rare phenotype
but there was some more
broadly dominant plants
that stayed shorter in structure
that peach one
that was that broadleaf dominant
which is what I was going after
at first it expressed very dark colors
even the male expressed really dark colors
in the sacks
but that female
especially amongst the land race
population it was frosty
as hell
and not only that but it was putting off
that peach flavor
and I was just like you're the one
it's just that obvious
and I kept a couple other females
and hit them as well
but I mainly wanted to select from that one plant
and see what we can get out of that
and then I was going to take those
probably make another selection
and then out cross from there
but last time I talked to you
you said it actually took a couple out crossings
before you started reaching
what's considered a more modernly
acceptable plant structure
yeah
yeah
you probably experienced that
some of these land race
flower density isn't going to be the same
as we're used to with the modern
cultivar and so
you might find that
you do need to take it a few generations
with a modern cultivar
or using very
aggressive selection
or dense flowers
if that's what you're looking for
but
sure
and some people aren't concerned about that
the main thing I think that this is
greatly used for
is
the terpene
the terpene flavor
that was the goal right off the bat
yeah I actually crossed it to
some afghani
work that I did
with one of my aliens
so it's called the afghalian
I crossed it to my
afghalian and it puts out
massive nuts
like 2 liter bottles
but they take like 13 weeks
to finish
and
it's unbelievable
how big they get
you wouldn't know
and this is one of these recessive space
you don't see these
phenotypes and phenotypes
within either one of those populations
until we out cross
so it is a really great strain
I'm happy that you're
messing with it
I can tell you already
I'm already feeling the effects of it
which is actually a little surprising
but I'm
it is
so it is selected as a drug cultivar
that's what it would be considered
in the middle east
as a drug cultivar
and
some of the tests actually
are over 16-19%
wow
and those tests were actually done in Oregon
in southern Oregon
on a farm
that we were not working on
but we were working with the farmer
and that was the same
all the same
seed stock and everything that
we had
worked with
so it's all really accurate information
so that's all that
generations of farm work
on location before it was even
handed to you
or was it Red Scare before you?
no it was
Real Seed Company
you're right
I'm already feeling it in my arms
my arms feel very
almost that tingly feeling
I can definitely feel it in my head
almost like a headband
but it's hitting me more like
a one to one where it's very very easy
and very comfortable
it's beautiful man
beautiful work
I wouldn't say trace amounts
but you know
1 or 3%
it could contain some
other
what's the word
I'm looking for
it might contain some other
cannabinoids
there we go
it might contain some other
cannabinoids than
absolutely
that's actually pretty common amongst
land races
when we did the testing
when the testing got done
I shouldn't say we did the testing
when the testing got done I think it was
2016 so there's been a whole load
of
cannabinoids that are discovered
absolutely
that's pretty amazing
especially when we came from
THC and CBD
and now you've got CBG
and you've got
even THCA and CBDA
we're going what?
oh that's why you gotta heat it up?
yeah and how long it was
where we were
we didn't know it
yeah that's a
topic that we just need to
put a whole episode on
THCV awesoming
all these different things
there's so many
on instagram where you guys were just like
every episode you guys were going over
like different types of terpene
oh yeah the terpene tuesday
it's cool to see how much stuff has been coming out
and every time they discover something
new
thanks man I really appreciate that
that means a lot coming from you
so before we get too off
subject
we want to go over
what Sunleaf's doing now
what are you doing with your company now
I'm seeing you're doing a lot more
feminized work
yeah so right now
we're still going to continue
the philandre's work
and preservation
that's never going to stop for us
but we are doing
a lot of feminized work
and with modern
postpartum
the main portion of this
work that we're starting right now
so out of these feminized
genetics that you're starting to work with
what are you putting out there
what do people have to expect
in the future
coming from Sunleaf
so the main thing
you know
the main thing with feminized
is that people find it
really convenient
it's kind of a market heading
but as a breeder
you can
really dial in
what's happening
where your plot is going
and this is something
that you can do with the male
when you do rigorous testing
not that we're not
doing testing
but when you can really see
what the phenotype and the genotype
of the female
you don't have
to deal with something that's unknown
so you kind of have
a little more
breeding
so
look for 2021 and 2022
we're going to be doing
pretty much only working with
all feminized breeding
techniques
all feminized lines
to really
give people
more options
for feminized feed
but also to try and win more people over
towards the feminized feed
there's a huge misconception
that feminized feed is
unstable
I was going to ask you about that
you know
if you're making it correctly
you know
it's usually not unstable
I haven't had any
any problems
and even some of the feminized feed
that I've been running
from other breeders
that have just started making it
the techniques
have really come a long way
from what we were using
even two years ago
so
you know
the idea is to really get people on board
with feminized feed
this is where the market is going
not that we're going to stop making regulars
but when you can eliminate
variables
when you want to directly
stabilize the line
it's not going to have a diversity or variation
without doing
years and years
of sim breeding and work
you know feminized is just the way to go
there's absolutely
a place for feminized seeds
and you know my first argument
would be these states that have
plant count limits and people don't want to get
in any trouble
it's nice to know that they're going to have what they want
coming out of that seed
or at least as long as it's from a reputable breeder
not only that if you have no interest in breeding at all
feminized might
just be for you
you know
yeah and a lot of people
you know some people don't think about
other people being limited on space
you know even me sometimes
I take the idea that someone might be limited on space
for granted
so being able to
pop three seeds and know that they're going to get
three females
is much better for them
they don't know if they're going to get three females
they don't know if they're going to get two
and they don't know if they're going to get six
they don't know if they're going to get twelve
I've been there
yeah and I have too
where you over pop
thinking that you're going to get males
and then you get all females and you go oh no
I'm going to have to get rid of some
that's an awesome problem
I can't say I've ever had that
so the idea is
you need to go to Vegas
I'm going to gamble right now
the idea is to be able to get people
more accustomed to
be comfortable growing feminine seeds
there really isn't
if you do all the research
you'll find that
the breeding is basically
the same
we're just making female seeds
instead of putting other variables
so a lot of people
argue that it's unnatural
you're just countering nature
and how can you
create a good product from something that's so
unnatural to the plant
I would really disagree
we are using a chemical
to change the hormonal production
of the plant
but the actual
physical
pollinating is still natural
and the seed production
is natural and the chromosomes
are all natural
it's just female
I encourage people to do more research
on it
and I think you'll find
when we're talking about humans
it's a much different thing
but when we're talking about plants
they're much different
it's actually extremely common in nature
this kind of breeding is extremely
common in the agriculture
industry
and that's one thing that the animal industry
has not caught up on
so to add to that
I would say that I've grown
quite a few fem seeds and I've never
had a problem with any of them
thankfully, hopefully it was good work
maybe I got lucky
but I've had
not only good results
with fems, I've never had an intersex
fem seed
and I've had some really really good yielders
I had one that was an amnesia haze fem
and I believe that was even from Barney's Farm
and it did excellent, it was like an 8 ounce
plant in a square
meter, no problem
yeah and
this is one of the things that
we're doing and you can
do with feminized seed is we can really dial
in
a trait that we want to lock in
it's just easier
to do because we can see the female
and we can see what this female
will put into a line
with this other female
and yeah, it has variables
between strains
that you can talk it to
but it's much more reliable
than
to be able to
see what you're doing
what you're working with than using a male
and guessing
and yeah, there's testing that you can do now
there's a lot of different kinds of testing
that we can get done
but when you're talking about the males
these guys throwing out their males
and throwing out selections
you still have
variables that you can't see
in those males that when you make
your
crosses
these variables can come out
and this is just
something that we're trying to eliminate
we're trying to stay on par
with the rest of the agriculture
industry
if you've done any research you'll see that
we're already doing tetraploid
and triploid breeding
we're creating
sterile plants
this is where we're going
and we're
trying to be on the coattails
to keep up with these people
yep, make your name in the industry
and keep it there
yeah, and you know
also
I'm not necessarily a scientist
my old partner
was a doctorate in horticulture
major in soil science
he taught me a lot
he's the one who taught me all the different cultural works
so I'm trying to
also be like a bridge
you know, I'm just a regular guy
a grower, you know, really into this stuff
and I try and put stuff
into terms that I can understand
you know, sometimes I have to go
double read the definition
just to read it 3 or 4 times
to understand it
digest it and put it into terms
that I can explain to other people
and sometimes that takes a while
but that's where I feel
like I personally fit into
the industry, along with my company
is like
being the bridgeway
I want to do the really scientific stuff
and keep up with these guys
but also be able to supply to
common people
and not big ad farms
stuff like that
yeah, keep an eye out
for our platinum SSV drop
that we're gonna do
got a bunch of really great hybrids
that we're gonna really put that
on Solo Burger
our pink copy
I've got reg
and a few fems that might drop
but it works with
the kind of copy we did
you can look back
and don't worry, I'll be releasing about it
but I don't have a lot of feed of it
so we're gonna do some more work with it
but look for me, pop up in Oregon
pop up in Oklahoma
you know, typically pop up
pop up in Colorado
that's where we're at
but really taking a couple footholds
in a couple other states
2021, 2022
and keeping up our normal work
so watch out
and come
grab some of our seed
give us a try
absolutely, go get yourself some Sunleaf Seed Company seeds
I can personally vouch for them
they're absolutely amazing
I couldn't be happier
I got a Landrace Preservation from you
but they were so stable
you did an amazing job
we've got something for everybody
we've got the Pure Landrace
Landrace Hybrid
and now we're dropping all the fems
