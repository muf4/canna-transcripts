three who would have thought we would have made it the podcast you'll know
what it is budding enthusiasts that is you thanks so much for joining me it's
your boy heavy days here for the newest episode and on this episode we are
joined by the one and only trichome jungles thank you so much as always
number one businesses in the game seeds here now you know where they are you
know where to get the fill whenever you got that craving they got that scratched
fix the itch your only seed bank that offers guarantee on satisfaction not
just germination hit them up and as always the good people at 420 Australia
and organic gardening solutions holding it down in the big land down under and a
special special thank you to our friends at dragonfly earth medicine that light
that leads the way on this episode trichome jungle I said it before you
ready for it part to get that hitter here we go alrighty so here we are again
my friends part two with a good friend of mine the guy who I like to chat with
a lot big thank you and welcome to banana man from trichome jungle seeds
nice to be back on the show again and I've been looking forward to this hey
my friend yeah really good really good and yeah just been there spending a lot
of time yeah on my own a lot lately and yeah just being with the plants and yeah
just do my thing really enjoying the time by myself that's awesome dude I see
that um you were on holiday not too long ago what was that about yeah we did a
little trip to India me sonic seeds a few other guys a guy from Afghanistan
he's on Instagram and Afghan black honey he came out from Afghanistan and he's
got big farm out there and so that was really good and met up with some Indian
guys we're up to Milano and yeah just all-round absolutely amazing experience
got to go to the field and yeah select our own seeds found some really special
smelling things things are a range of from like melons and grapefruit to like
berries and that amazing absolutely amazing Wow so what was the standout
smoke of the trip we were smoking a lot of charis and mainly so we do friends
there was some we got some brought some gelato with us and things like this and
a few different Moroccan hashes to show the farmers there and that so yeah but
the the charis up in that like altitude and smoking from the chillin yeah it's a
total different high really really enjoyable and like everybody's sort of
like you smoke in the chillin and everybody's talking there's like a
really nice energy from that from smoking the hash as well yeah beautiful so do you
feel like it's it's almost kind of like more satiry like it kind of sounds like
you're saying like it's kind of social and energetic oh this is the thing right
like yes okay the more precious stuff seems to be like more energetic but
anything that's been cured for a while especially the previous year's charis
that they cured yeah when I was smoking that I couldn't help but just fall
asleep yeah like one day I think I had two naps after smoking it so it was that
that stuff was super strong so I think it depends on the curing process a lot
and even from field to field and farmer to farmer there was a difference in in
the the heirloom varieties that they were cultivating there so yeah there was
definitely a difference so depend on who you got the hash from there would be a
difference in high flavor how it smoked how it burned everything so yeah and
were they all growing heirloom varieties or did you see like some kind of random
stuff in the mix no I didn't notice any sort of modern hybrids maybe like in
closer to the cities and stuff like that maybe you'd see more things like this
speaking to other people they seen some stuff like that but right up where we
were going it was all stuff that they've been farming for yeah generations really
the smells were really unusual in some fields but you had this underlying
standard smell that you found a lot everywhere but then you had variations
from that and then the odd unique one when you got to the fields and could
really go into the fields and what was that standard smell kind of like like a
spice maybe slight aniseed smell and a slight berry smell they were the main
ones and like in the fields you were finding I'd say about 20% were purple
and the purple ones had a slight more berry smell but even some of them still
had that spicy underlining spicy smell going on but the most unique ones were
the one that smell like watermelon yeah but watermelon sweets okay but it was
just one plant just one plant out of the whole field it was just really really
strange and then I found one that was straight grapefruit pomelo and I just
kept trying to look for more of it there was only that one plant I could find and
we're talking like out of a field of thousands of thousands so I was just
going around but the dominant smell was the spice smell spice berries I think
that's the best way to describe it like raisins raisins there you go like raisins
yeah okay and so were you looking to collect seeds and were you successful
yeah yeah so I collected like I've labeled them as like what they smelled
like mainly because that's what I was trying to find the growth and other
things I broke down but the main things for me were like there was one that
smelled like Vicks vapor rub and there was one that smelled like the grapefruit
then I did a selection for purple types purple calyx purple leaf ones for red
stems and a few other ones that were like green varieties but with that
typical sort of spice smell that the usual ones but like you could see a big
difference even even in the growth of the plants as you were going up much
much higher like when you're going from like a thousand feet higher up and then
you took another 500 and you've seen a big difference in the growth yeah things
were getting smaller as you were getting higher up okay so kind of becoming like
more squat not squat as such but smaller in in in structure in in height and stuff
like that yeah yeah but they they weren't and like anything like an indica
even though they're a hash plant but then once I've seen the seeds being
grown out back here they look more indica okay so I think the way that they
grow the plants so close together and when they're in full flower the leaves
tend to go a little bit more thinner and I see this outdoors anyway you can grow
the same thing indoors and outdoors and you see the more true true growth pattern
of it outdoors so if I grow say orange soda inside it doesn't have super thin
leaves but then when you grow it outside the leaves always come out thinner and
you can see it's real sativa and it looks like a sativa like that Christmas
tree type of structure the growth conditions and how they farm them and
all of this really yeah plays a big role on how the plant looks as well what was
the highest you went up to eventually two and a half thousand I think that's
what we went up to I'd have to double check on my notes and stuff like that
because well as we were going up I was you know writing down the altitude and
things like that at certain points where I've getting the seeds and stuff like
this that's the good thing about these smartphones one of my friend other
smartphones we could like just keep checking everything where we were and
stuff like this really good you can even write it down on the GPS if you
really wanted to see the locations where you exactly found them yeah yeah okay so
what's the end goal with these landry seeds obviously probably do a seed
increase but do what do you want to work it into yeah okay so the also while we
were there the guy from Afghanistan he brought some Afghan seeds with him okay
no I don't know if you've checked his page have you seen his page this Afghan
kush black honey yeah boy yeah okay he's got some amazing amazing
plants that so I've just been growing some of those seeds out and found a
really nice male and I've pollinated it with the Baba kush the cherry cookie the
sour neo mandarin so that's what I'm gonna be doing next is testing them out
and seeing how they come out and working that Afghan into some maybe some other
lines I'd like to do some selections from the Indian thing stuff I've
collected and work the Afghan into some of them as well so I think that's gonna
be a lot of testing and it's gonna be really interesting yeah just just
learning always this plant teaches me so much this is like truly like a teacher
plant I've learned so much from it you know from electrics and photography and
growing plants nutrition everything you can possibly imagine I think so many
people forget this and just see the money nowadays instead of like having
that real passion to learn about this plant yeah right well I mean the
adventure you described there's a lot of passion involved in that but I just
wanted to quickly ask like how do you feel having had these kind of worldly
experiences with cannabis how does it make you perceive just everyday cannabis
now does it just hammer home that feeling of like the whole polyhybrid
thing or is it just refreshing I still love polyhybrids but I think when you're
talking about real breeding it's like the scene nowadays it's like loads of
people trying to breed from mongrel dogs and expecting something like coming out
like totally stable and when I say stable I mean like coming out uniform or
looking exactly the same yeah we've got like so much variation in in our gene
pool which is a good thing as well but I think we really do need to go back
towards these land race things and create maybe like a new skunk number one
or something like this so I'd like to definitely work with the indica lines
and then maybe one that they've worked I've worked those lines a little bit
more out into the city but to create something that's all totally from land
race and that comes out like a breeding line should come out but I still love
polyhybrids and I love the variation and I love using all these different
things even cookies and some cherry pie and things like this they're all really
nice unique and serpient profiles so yeah I think I love them all really to
be honest yeah I agree but let's talk making a new skunk I've tried to bring
this up in the past and no one wants to go there with me we're doing it what
genetics would be involved in quote the new skunk what do you think it's gonna
be well from there was two ways I was looking at it basically using two sativa
lines and then adding the Afghan to it but now I'm looking towards more to hash
line to hash plant lines so like a Milano hash plant and a Afghan hash plant
I'm working that line and then adding the sativa to it just to add that I don't
know about that bigger structure the bud structure the calyx to leaf ratio and
things like this so it could be interesting but this is all gonna be
told like it's all gonna be experimental at first because really don't know what
the outcome is gonna be I might cross them together and then just totally be
like I really don't like it I'm gonna have to start again so but it's all
gonna be really interesting I think I'd either use the Afghans gotta go in
there I think that's it that's a key main key to so many things from the past
and then maybe some of the sativa I'd use it'd be probably something from South
America yeah like a walking type of thing yeah like something I can maybe
a couple gold type of strain does it exist anymore does it exist I think I
think things could be found from the areas and wicked things can be found in
I think it can be it can be done the one thing I have got from really old
seeds are my Malawi seeds that friend collected from for me from Malawi so
that'd be another interesting one African sativa yeah again I I just
really need a nice big greenhouse and one two years to just grow out the
suitcase of seeds I've got all the different things so that's gonna be the
next plan the next plan maybe Caribbean the Caribbean is looking good at the
moment yeah okay cool cool so out of the genetics we haven't spoken about you
know non land-raised stuff what's some of the new stuff you're excited to work
with my sort of new things I'm working with the sour neo is gonna be something
really special that's gonna be the next sort of new release but from what I
released from last year and that is the little everyone's really loving that and
the cherry spice they're just both absolutely amazing cherry spice is
probably my favorite after the sour near and the little is just so unusual but
the little like people have been asking a lot like what's in the little and
stuff like that and the father was a jungle kush and the mother was a cross
of pineapple and something else so that come from Sonic and that and that's
something I didn't mention too much about in the last one actually like you
were asking about some of the UK clones and stuff like UK pineapple was a real
special UK clone but after like so many years it lost something it was like
some sort of genetic drift happened or something I think tissue culture might
have been able to bring that back so so I've been looking into that a lot lately
that's interesting have you heard of the concept of like a plant being dotted yes
this is what Sonic told me about I was that's what I said to him maybe the
tissue culture can help this out because then if it's some sort of illness that
someone's got in their plants it can be removed with tissue culture so I don't
know if the dodding thing can happen I think he was telling me Bodhi was talking
to him about it yeah dude Bodhi was the one who told me about it it's like it's
you can look it up because so the backstory is that a lab today or
yesterday I think it was put up a post saying that um they've got like this
patent-pending process where it's basically you know meristem culturing
but they reckon that yeah they can definitely undo a plant that's dotted
and and what dotting is is like there's this actual I think it's a bacteria
might be a virus it's or even a fungi I don't know I'll just cover all my bases
it's it's one of them and and the government like literally was spraying
it over California for a while and if it gets in your plant it just gets in the
systemic system and the plants just fucked forever and like they just won't
really flower they got no vigor it's like an actual virus you can look it up
so that's great you said that right about the government right because there
was one show I can't remember the show but they was talking about the
government releasing broad mites or another type of mite next there are
roads so they kill the weeds and that that way they don't have to spray
pesticides that harm the bees okay yeah but they've been releasing these in
places where people grow weed in America and then now all of a sudden they're
having big problems with broad mites and stuff like and it just like just seems
like it's just crazy that they would even release them like that you see what
I mean like you know yes they definitely did it and what they would
also do is I think I read a little bit about this and they would go along every
so often and spray some pesticides on the mites like to kind of fight them at
bay and so they just bred like the borg themselves yeah yeah yeah yeah this is
it just resistant you see it you see it like even in Holland and places like
this where the mites built a resistance to so many different sprays and and
yeah this is what will happen so yeah all right we better pull it back in
before you go to Alex Jones on this so the Lilt seems to be extremely popular
you know and you mentioned the unique terpene profile how would you describe
the terpene profile and you're gonna kind of find a male and work it forward
yeah well I'm gonna definitely work the line but at the moment I'm getting
really high percentages of that pheno so I was really happy with that release
and everybody seems to be getting from a 10 pack they'll be getting at least four
of the phenos like the mother and the other things are maybe like a slight
watered down version tropical thing some people are finding like a slight fruity
tropical cushy thing that one was really nice I found that one was almost better
than the actual mother because it had this like cushy with the tropical taste
which was really really nice but the main flavor from the Lilt is like if you
get a tropical juice which has got passion flower and pineapple in it
that's the dominant smell I smell off the plant and while the plant is growing
it's by far the smelliest plant that you'll come across in your room but in a
sweet gentle sort of not like a strong stinky way it's such a beautiful smell
I just love going into room literally just smelling it it's just so unique and
then when it comes out as a dried bud the smell is less in your face and a
little bit more subtle but when you smoke it you're left with this like
tropical taste on the tongue like a tropical juice Sonic says it's like tin
tropical fruits that's how he describes it and I describe it like a tropical
juice. Interesting and so do you have any kind of plans in the works with Sonics
or are you guys just kind of trading clones? No yeah we're definitely gonna be
doing more work together in the future and he's gonna be definitely bringing
out more pineapple crosses looking at the Kali, Schnapple, the Persang so yeah
there's gonna be a lot of Sonic stuff coming out over the next year. Sweet and
so do you plan to continue working with the mandarin or is that kind of doing
its thing on the back burner while you do some Lilt and other things? Yeah
everything takes so much time and space and stuff like this so yeah sometimes
you have to just put something aside for the time being but the mandarin will be
the next lot will be a feminized cross to bring back like the orange soda, the
gingerbread, what else was there, the mandarin a cush and I think maybe I can
imagine a lot of them being grown out in Morocco and places like this so
because they loved all the hash coming from that so yeah they're great for the
hash production and stuff like this. Hell yeah so the Jungle Kush hybrids in
general appear to be going pretty well received what's your overall impression
of them in retrospect like if you could only kind of recommend one to me which
one would you recommend besides the Lilt obvious choice? Cherry Spice that'd be
the one. I should put a caveat and rule that out as well. Okay something else
what am I really liking I've already said about the Sour Neo I'll go into more
detail about the Sour Neo and Sour Neo that's something really special okay so
that was made using Hortilabs Sour Power clone and the Sour Diesel which was
selected by Karma from Rezdog's IBL Sour Diesel. That's the one he's done that
BX2 with? Yes so at the time when we were working together that's when those seeds
were made and they were like a little limited release so I did a selection
from those seeds but they were all coming out very like sour but then there
was one very unique one which had this like sour twang but it smells like
grapefruit slightly when it's growing but then when it finishes off you can't
really smell the grapefruit in it anymore and it turns into this like sour
antiseptic smell which is like it's absolutely amazing that's what I'm
smoking some of the outdoor from last year of this and that's probably my
favorite it's not the prettiest plant to look at like structure wise but the
flavor like is amazing and the extract made from is amazing the high is so
strong like you smoke a few joints of that in the evening and you're having
the best sleep of your life like yeah all-round great plant and I've crossed
that with my Jungle Kush to make the Sour Neo so that's a real special one
the Jungle Kush male as well is just not very dominant in the crosses so you get
mainly the phenos from the mother side of things so when I crossed it with a
passion flower everything comes out like smelling like that tropical passion
flower sort of smell when I crossed it with the cherry cookie everything comes
out like that cherry cookie type of thing so it's it's it's a really good
male to use like I've used it to cross with a few other things to make like the
Rian this was like a so the first line was rosewater cookie that's what Rian
is that was crossed with the Jungle Kush to make the hundred hand slap and then a
male from the hundred hand slapped was used to go back to the Rian to make the
back cross and that's that's that's like a new line that I'm just releasing I've
also got a clone that I selected which is a Rian clone and that's been passed
around as well so you should see a lot more of that around this coming year
hell yeah and how would you describe the profile on that?
like okay some people say it's like the Mac but with a bit more turps okay but
like how I would describe it is like slight berry but with like this cookie
thing in the background but you can definitely taste that there's like
there's some like almost Kush in there it's it's it's a nice nice but it's not
dominant in any one one thing like it's not just pure gas or it's not just pure
Kush you can taste all these different under notes with it so yeah it's a great
one and I named that after my mother because just when you grow it in the
room it just it just stands out from everything else the growth pattern on it
is a little bit more unusual all the branches sort of all come up to a set
sort of place and it stays doesn't branch outwards it doesn't like to grow
wide quite a sort of slender type plant.
Interesting and so the question I always have to ask what kind of techniques you
using to kind of identify your breeding males?
I think one of the main things with I think selecting the males especially over
time yeah because you've grown so many different plants over the years like I've
probably got thousands of different plants and different smells and
structures and stuff like so you get to see so much so I think a lot of it just
comes from past experience past knowledge feeling and then obviously
after all of that the stem of the structure of the plant what I'm looking
for if if I'm looking for a short structure and I want to make something
with a short structure then I'm going to select the male with that more shorter
structure so like little simple things like this but I think genetically is one
of the main things that the male has to have come from
plants that the females are all very stable in that they're all very similar
so then you know that the male is going to be very similar to the females
if you're picking a male from a pack of seeds that has got so many different
variations and phenos then it's going to be harder to select especially a terpene
profile from that male so I think terpene profile is one of my main things
with my last lots of breeding that I've been doing so I'm trying to get if it's
something is is it like lilt then I want more to be like lilt and snowy and
tropical if I want the cherry spice I want them all with that cherry spiced
gas sort of smell so that's the lines I sort of go down
yeah okay so how many seeds do you like to put when you're looking to find your
new male?
it varies so I can select a male from one one packet of seeds because
I'm usually picking a male from something that I've created myself
so I already know both parents that have been grown out from
many generations like yeah many years and I know those plants like
the back of my hand I know how they've worked previously so
when I'm using stuff it's normally stuff that I've
already made myself so I think that that's a big thing
so what about if you're going to use someone else's stock how many packs
would you want to grab? well at least a couple of packets but
then if I'm not finding really good females from one packet
do I really want to use a male from that packet to see what I'm saying
but obviously as if you're going to do a nice selection
I'd be like 30 plants to do a nice selection
okay and then as like a bit of a follow-up to that how many
seeds of each strain if you had to guess would you say generally get pop
before you would say a strain is ready for market?
yeah once I've grown it out and two or three friends have said they
really like it then that's like ready to go
like the last ones all them would really just tested by me
and one friend the previous ones they were done by a
lot more people but I'm finding when I do actually ask
people to test things some people can be quite slow so I'm
literally just quicker to test things myself
so as long as I'm getting I test a couple of packets and I'm
getting really nice things from a couple of packets
I'm happy with that but then when I want to start writing down
percentages of phenotypes and stuff like that that's only going to come with
more time I'm really limited by space to be honest
otherwise I would like to be starting a lot more seeds
yeah you raise a really interesting point there because
a lot of breeders seem to be doing pretty much exclusively in-house testing
much to the same reason you gave that testers are kind of inconsistent these
days how do you feel about the idea that you
know a lot of packs that get sent out to be tested just end up being added to
someone's seed bank? yeah I'm not going to say how much
how much I've sent out of like test seeds and free seeds but we're
talking like a lot a lot a lot and a small
fraction of percentage actually get grown out and stuff
it's quite sad I find Spanish guys are really good they'll
get a packet of seeds and they'll grow them out
yeah in the UK if they get something for free
yeah that goes in their seed drawer but if they paid
500 for that packet that's getting popped straight away
so I'm definitely going to be doing a different way of testing when I do
to the public I'm going to be using breed bay in the future a lot more
which is a forum that we used to use I think
I think it's now is the sort of time to maybe push that a little bit more
and start spending a bit more time on there I think people are trying to grow
from Instagram and places like this where there's not
enough knowledge and like they need a place where people are
happy to share knowledge not going to like be horrible to the
person if they ask a silly question because we're all young we're all
learning at one point so you know I think a place like that's
needed right now so for expert growers and new growers so
everybody can learn from each other and a place where I can offer like
little limited releases to people to test out
new lines that I'm about to release and I want them to just
grow them out even if I've tested them already it's
good for other people to see it and see what they think
so I think breed bay is going to be the place where a lot more of this is going
to be done it'll be good to see people grow them
out and do little grow logs that's what we used to do a lot more
years ago you'd see people grow them out they'd be talking about how what ph
their feeding amount how many milliliters of this
nutrient how many mils of that nutrient exactly their temperatures and they show
it every week they'd update and I think that's needed now
especially for anybody that's serious about growing
serious about even breeding in the future once they've collected a really
nice library and tested all their stuff out
and to share knowledge like there's so many things that I've
learned over the years and yeah I'm happy to share all of this
with people so I think breed bay is going to be the
new place for this
yeah I don't know I feel like it's hard to get people back on
forums because it's like the idea has been thrown around a lot but
it seems like you need more than just the forum to get people on there do you
think there'll be like other breeders kind of getting on there
which would incentivize it well okay Bodhi's already on there he's
got his own little uh page a lot of people don't even know
this and professor p from dynasty he used to be on there he he's still got
his own section so all these guys will be posting a lot more on there I'm
going to be going back there sonic's going to be there
um so I think it's going to be um yeah an interesting little place a
little community let's see if we can get it going like it
used to be I think there's enough new growers
and people that are serious about growing that
would like to join and yeah yeah and it's got a little chat
even got a little chat room on there so every day people come in
have a chat in the little room any questions
they can see who's online they can ask a little question and get
get the answer without anybody else coming on and
being horrible or missing the post because
you post a post on instagram but nobody really looks past a couple of posts and
things like people just flicking nowadays whereas
people want to be able to go back somewhere look at it
and learn something I think this is missing I think
people need to be learning more reading more
yeah so I think it's time we shall see yeah okay
sounds g kind of on that topic do you have any plans to try to get your
genetics out kind of more into the international
distribution streams yeah um well Benson Elvis which is like
a big farm in America and they already grow the
orange soda mandarin a kush um they're doing the lilt now they're
going to be doing more of the jungle juice
and they're popping the cherry spice and things like that next
and they've been getting um their product it made into extract and
yeah they're all loving over there I think just more people need to try it I
think once more people try it then we're going to
see this um um burst
of uh try come jungle tips there's there's been a lot more people
growing out the lilt lately so there's been some nice uh
batches of it available in some of the social clubs in Barcelona and stuff
like that so that's been really good to see um
I've even seen mandarin a kush on the menu in Amsterdam
and they said that lilt will be there soon so that's really nice as well
yeah these are the little things that make me smile
like when people um
uh enjoy the love and work that I put into everything so
yeah hell yeah so kind of in that same vein this is one I've
been pondering a bit myself lately do you believe like a breeder's
responsibility over their genetics extends past the wholesaler like for
example if someone has an issue with your seeds is it kind of your job or the
wholesaler's job to fix that one no I always tell the wholesaler to tell
them to send me a message direct on instagram
or my email um because um that way like
I I try to answer every single message that I get
because um I know what it was like when I was much younger and stuff like that
if I was able to speak to breed I think that would be
an amazing thing so someone's growing out my seeds and they've paid money to
to buy those seeds and support me I think it's a little bit part of my job
to try my best to answer as many questions as I can
but if someone is going to write me a question I prefer to actually if they
write me a question not just like hi how are you like
it's hard to go through so many messages but if there's a question there that I
can look read it through a couple days later okay
that's it answer that question that that's much
easier for me um but yeah um I enjoy doing it as well
especially if I have the extra time yeah I don't mind doing it at all yeah
okay so how do you handle complaints by customers
like if someone were to contact you and said
they'd grown your gear out and they'd have some sort of issue maybe let's say
it's like hermed out or whatever is your first response to kind of like
you know see if maybe something's up with the garden
um okay um
yeah I don't really too many get too many but let's see
somebody might message me saying about germination
okay I get this a lot germination now all my seeds are fully tested I test
them like on a regular basis as well and they
they there's no problem with germination now
I will ask the person like you know try and figure out what their problem was
I see in winter time we we get a lot more problems with germination
so it just shows that it is environment stuff but
I will try to send them a couple of extra seeds to try and make up
for that just so they're happy I want everybody to be happy
um if someone said to me something hermed and they sent me some pictures
and all of this um I might be inclined to send them a
packet so they are happy at the end but um I think a lot of things comes
down to environment um we grow out so many
uh different varieties ourselves you must come across this yourself
even in packs that have been you've grown out grown out and then
maybe you might find one that herms or puts out some bananas
it does happen especially if you're using things like
sour diesel um cherry pie things like that which have a tendency to do it
so um yeah it happens um and if I can send them a packet of
seeds and make them happy then I will do this yeah
yep cheers grandma but uh anyway um what type of lighting you're using at
the moment
um govitas um just because um I got them a couple of years ago um just
still using them at the moment um when I get my new place that will they'll
be changed um I've been looking into some leds at
the moment as well um because I'm seeing some quite good
results for them I like to just try them out myself just
just as a little test um I think that could be something good
for the future with the energy consumption and stuff
like this but um outdoors is um
is the way using the sun yeah so how are things in Spain at the moment
is the law is evolving to kind of cater more to breeders or is it still a case
of like you know out of sight out of mind type of thing
yeah like that basically um I've had a few little run-ins and
yeah not the best of luck to be honest um
but uh yeah they're still far from being legal out here
so far from it but it's like Amsterdam isn't it
like they have all that in the coffee shops but how it's produced is
all a grey area isn't it so so what country would you recommend
aspiring breeders to look to if they were going to relocate because
people often talk about Spain
um Spain is is definitely going to be uh the future I can see it but
for for at the moment yeah I think there's still a long way to
go but then you look to America and they've
gone legal there and everyone's like oh no they've gone legal now
so it I think how Spain's got it with the clubs I think they just need to
be accepted if they can be um
accepted by a court of law and uh the production for the clubs can be
accepted and some papers can be brought in so
it's almost like decriminalizing it to some extent um I
think that could really work
yeah okay so with that being said do you see a viable future for
a person from like a currently illegal country
to move to Spain try to set themselves up create themselves a job in the
industry over there or do you just think it's too prohibitive to just do that
um I think anybody should come out to Spain first
and check it out and see how they feel about it
spend a few weeks here um see the clubs speak to the people and
I think you can most people would be able to judge it themselves and how they
feel about the situation
so do you approach it with the view of like
a producer or a breeder because in my mind it seems like you could just kind
of be off in the background doing your own
thing and hopefully no one bothers you right
yeah that's what I've tried to do but then
um I live really out in the country so it's a tiny little place
and I stand out a little bit and um yeah I've drawn attention to
myself and the police have asked questions and stuff like this and
so I had to pack things down and move them and
it's been a lot of hassle for me but it's it's worked out good in the end
but yeah it's a lot of uh a lot of work um how how it's portrayed on the
internet like Spain's this totally legal place and you can grow weed here
and stuff like that was uh was how it was portrayed to me
when I first moved here and I found out very quickly that it
wasn't like that
yeah okay so I want to play devil's advocate for a moment here
if for some reason you had to leave Spain and move to
another country which one would you move to? Canada
you say that like you're ready to do it right now
um I don't know like I think Canada sort of does appeal to me I can't see
myself going there to live though to be honest
um I like the sunshine in Spain I like the weather
the people are really nice um yeah so I can't see myself moving
moving to Canada but I think if anybody is free to do what they would they
want and they're looking at moving to a country
I think Canada there could be a lot of opportunities in Canada coming up
so I mean given you are a breeder in Spain a little bit unrelated but kind of
is there the same explosion of breeders over there in the same sense that we see
in America and the rest of the world?
um yeah there has been a little bit um but I'm seeing some people
they're getting like as many sort of clones as they come together
um or even just plants other people have selected
and then um pollinating them with with a male and
or reversing a plant and pollinating them and then selling the seeds
not tested never grown out any of the parents and I'm just like
it's just for real so yeah like it's there's a lot of people making
seeds now um and
putting any any names and yeah it's all gone a bit crazy to be
honest um is that what you sort of mean like
lots of sort of like seed companies popping up
with no real testing and stuff like this?
yeah I mean that's definitely one part of it but I was also curious
sometimes you hear about like big seed producers over there like I think
Dynafem does something over there or something like that like do you know
anything about that?
yeah no I don't know too much about that but I can imagine yeah there's a lot of
people over here producing seeds for their companies and stuff like
this yeah
yeah interesting there's the horror stories always relate back to
Spain somehow?
yeah yeah no there's a lot of um
people use Spanish guys to make their seeds
um yeah many many of the big companies yeah that's it
so while we're on the topic of going through seeds making parents
how many plants do you tend to cull before you find like a keeper female
and when you find your kind of clone only's
does it happen often from a 10 pack or given you're at like you know the higher
breeder level do you do these larger scale searches?
no you can do all your selection from a 10 pack
um it all depends on what you're using that
so like I said before if you're not finding really great things from a 10
pack like yeah you you want to be finding some
real nice stuff um obviously if you start and then from
uh you find something special and you really want to look
down that line more starting another 50 100 seeds of that one type is
worth doing to find something really special again and work that line
um I'm going to be doing a lot more work with the
a lilt male soon so there'll be a lot of lilt hybrids I've just done
the lilt with the jungle cush but then this is more like a little bit of a
back cross so it's more watered down you get like
this fruity cush thing coming out so but I definitely want to add the
lilt with a few different things I've got planned
um and then from them do some selection and work the lines the
same as I'm going to do with the afghan hybrids we'll see how they come out
in the first generation but I think each line's going to really need to be
worked to find something um to get something that you can release
I forgot to ask what were the females of the afghan line like
okay um okay the male smell much better than females
the male had this like uh grapefruit smell going on
but the females were more on like how I said about the Indian spiced anise
seed smell you had this thing I could smell it in
the afghans as well so it's like this it just reminds me of
like a lot of old school stuff I've had before
even my nap that I had in the past which made the
mantis that had that anise seed like hindu kush type smell going on
so um yeah it's definitely definitely along those lines
and do you have any information about what area the afghans came from
yeah they're from bulk province uh near mazar sharif um but we've got
like I've got some here but then between
all of us now he sent a lot more so we've literally
got seeds from every province and place in Afghanistan
and which one excites you the most the ones that I've got at the moment to be
honest but then I'm gonna be getting a few different
uh different ones so we'll see like some people are getting ones that are
like a lot more cabbage looking like the leaves like
really really fat so and those ones were the
do you know I'd have to go and look because I can't remember right now
but that's somebody else that was growing them that I seen on instagram
but from the same farmer but he collected them from another farm
in another area so yeah I think this year is going to be
the year of the afghan there's going to be a lot of afghan
seeds being grown out from different areas so it's going to be really
interesting to see I'm already seeing so many different
variations and the different people growing them so
have you ever thought of like rounding up a whole bunch of afghan clones
kind of doing like what bodhi did with like the deep line alchemy and like just
hitting all these afghans with like this cool afghan bow
yeah I think there could be a lot of different things going on and
people sharing a little bit pollen so they can hit this one and things like
this yeah this is this will be happening
cool cool and so what type of sativs do you want to hit with the afghan
eventually um yeah the
malawi seeds I'm definitely going to pop them um
and some of the south american stuff we'll see how they come out but I think
malawi I don't know there's just something about that pack of malawi
that's just crying to me to pop them so we'll see what happens with them
and I don't think I've asked what would you use as the final sativa component
for your skunk um
I don't I don't know that maybe something
south american again or a tie it all depends
it all depends um but we've got so many different things to go through
um like on on the trips to india there was like not just me sonic there
was a guy hit from himalayan connection some other guys
um so they've also got some real nice stuff in their collection
things like this so the we've got so many different things to pick from
we've got like some real nice sativas even from india and stuff like that so
yeah and the library is uh is very big at the moment between all of us
okay so just to kind of play devil's advocate then again
what type of genetics would you like to see come back into kind of the community
that kind of aren't really around at the moment
um some more nice really fruity things just uh things with
uh something a little bit more unusual terpene profile
um I don't think there's any like particular
line I'd like to bring back I'd like to see a lot more
um maybe some sonics uh pineapple hybrids he had one called pine queen
which was absolutely amazing if he brings that back it'll
blow people's minds it was such a beautiful plant
so um yeah I'd like to see some of them from the old school I'd like to see some
hash plants coming back that's why I'd like to work with the
afghans and uh uh melana plants so we can make a nice
hash plant
yeah definitely and so do you feel like it's inherently a part of those plants
that you get kind of that more cbn more sedative type of high or not
necessarily yeah no that's what i'm looking for in
this hash plant type thing something that literally
you get halfway down that spliff and it just knocks you out you want to go to
sleep that's what i'm looking for um that's
why I think it's going to be interesting with the bubba kush because the
bubba kush has got that more medicinal
sedative type of high to it especially if you just flower it out that extra week
like it's such a beautiful smoke and I've crossed that with the afghan so
um spanner this is is next week so um a week after so um I might take a few
of those seeds with me to give out to a couple of people to test out
and gonna do like a release of the little again there because
they just sold out so fast everybody went
crazy for them in so doing another release of them
and then um I'll probably be working the line a lot more then
and doing some nice little hybrids are you gonna have your own booth at
spanners no no I'm not gonna be doing a booth
most of the booths have been already like taken and that so
I'm just doing like I did the previous year where I'll do
an evening event in a club each night so Friday night in one club
Saturday night in another club and the final night
in another club and just do little um seed release there and it's good
actually it's a little bit more personal people are coming there to like sort of
see you and that so it's nice to talk to the people sit down
show them some of the different um flower and stuff like this um yeah
it's it was a really good evening so I'm doing three different clubs
this year but I'll still be in the expo in the daytime
sounds like you're gonna have to swing by my buddy lucky dog seeds get some
chem dog yeah okay is he there is he yeah yeah
skunk va okay do you know what number buffy that
you have to send me in a message after if you find out yeah dude go get some of
them hybrids my friend sent me a bud shout out burke
um a while back and I only just finished smoking it today it was so strong it
just lasted me forever okay nice nice yeah I'll have to check
them out is there anyone else you want to check
out there um do you know what I just
is I got to tend to go just to meet up with uh
old friends and um some new friends and stuff like that so
um there's never ever enough time to see everybody there's always somebody that I
miss and stuff like that so I'll try and see as many people as
possible there's a few clubs that have got some
lilt and stuff like that in there so they told me to come by have a look at
it so yeah it'll be interesting it'll be
nice to um see what people have produced from
the seeds from last year and stuff like this yeah are there
people like like selling clones there and stuff like
in the states or not really no nothing like this no
so just like flower and concentrate yeah you've got to go to just one of the
social clubs because be a member of the clubs and then you can
get access to that but most people sort of like bring their own little bit of
smoke and smoking everyone's smoking quite openly
and it's quite a relaxed environment but I've heard high times have just
bought it out so spanner base now has been bought by
high times so from this year on it's going to be
high times or spammable high times whatever
don't know what they'll call it but yeah I could see it probably changing
a little bit after this year and so how do you feel about high times
owning it you think like whatever or not good
whatever but I can't see it being um
well previous things it's just it all changes in there and then it'll
everybody is just all about whoever pays the most gets gets the cup and
all of this sort of stuff it's just all changes so
um for 2020 spanner this time um a few people I know are gonna put a
nice little cup on at the same sort of time so that's going to be a nice like
um more transparent cup anyway you'll get to see all the boats and everything
so that'll be quite good um and during spanner this anyway there's always
other little cups on like they've got the
masters of rosin and uh what's it what's that um legends of hash
that bubble man and them always put on so there's always a little other events
going on so should be good for this year and next
year do you ever get sick of any of the egos
yeah there's always egos it's getting worse but
yeah I just laugh it's good makes me smile and laughing's good for your body
so if people make me laugh yeah it's beneficial to me
yeah I can imagine you'd have a blast at one of those events
I'm always smiling yeah
um so how important do you think it is to produce kind of
medically potent strains you know I'm not just talking about CBD
I mean kind of like the example that's been weighing in my mind is
um my good buddy stray fox he pointed out that
although the pre-98 bubba is arguably a better smoke you know probably no one
will dispute that the katsu cut it's far more medicinal
you know so with that in mind do you think it's
important that we like try to breed with these types of things like for the
medicinal value or do you think it's just of
kind of inconsequential because the market's just mostly wreck
um yeah I think because like I go down more the flavor and stuff like that
because it's more the like that's what I like about it so much
but the high really does come into it and the bubba
is such a medicinal strain that whenever I um crossed it into things in
the past I'd always sort of um put that in the description
because every time you added bubba into things
the height of the the offspring would always come out with that beautiful
bubba type high added to it and it was it was definitely felt in the legs
like such a relaxing type of smoke and people with back pain and things like
this yeah enjoy it so much so I think
so many people do use it medicinally but don't realize it we say
recreational but if it makes you feel happy and your well-being
is good that's medicinal if it helps your stiff joints or
you've got a little bit of pain in the neck or it helps you to relax your body
after work this is all medicinal so I think
so many people do actually use it in a medicinal way but don't actually realize
it
yeah okay and so do you think there should be any distinction or do you
think just greater education greater education yeah um I think that's
the main thing because we even know even with you're
growing something from seed it's not always going to be exactly how
you imagine it you get different variations in the seeds um so I think
educating people about um all these different
compounds genetics um the terpenes I think that's that's that's a
big thing yeah and so what field of research would you
like to see cannabis expand more into then
um testing like it like just testing for terpenes
and uh all the other chemicals in the plants um
and like there's just so many things that we come to conclusions
but we can never really um fully back them up unless we test
so I think seeing a lot more uh testing and tissue culture I'd like to
see um how things go with the tissue culture
and like we were talking about getting rid of
uh genetic diseases or getting rid of uh
um just normal diseases you know with the tissue culture you're producing a
totally clean um
clone of of the mother so I think that's one good thing I see
so many people passing clones and it's how you pass disease so
one thing I do not take in is clones
so do you just everything's from seed more or less
everything's from seed so I could actually I like all
everything that I I use now the only clone that I have in my library right
now is the bubba kush um
everything else is clones I've selected myself
from seed originally or new things I've selected from seeds and yeah so
I only do things I've selected from seeds from now on
it's the best way yeah you know you're you're you're clean from any
of uh external influences so how long will it take you on average
before you find a new keeper like for example if you're doing a crop every
you know let's just say three months to be on the easy number side
you're finding one each cycle you're finding two you're finding one every two
cycles what's your numbers like all depends on on what I'm starting
um uh so from if I'm starting
10 different varieties okay um I'll find three or four nice keepers
but then the other things are still nice
I'm finding because then I'll pass them out to people
and they'll be like I can't believe you're getting rid of this
and I'll be like well yeah just it's not something I'm going to use
so um yeah there's so many keepers like I'm finding
the more different breeders that you pop things from as well
you find so much different flavors and smells
um so yeah um so
so which breeders work are you most excited to look into
um well do you know what I had to got some stuff from
mad farmer he sent me some nice seeds over
and I haven't had the chance because they literally came
at the time when I had all the um problems just after that where I had to
move everything and then after that I was about to pop
them but I had to just give them a back seat for a little bit
um because I was I had to just pop all my own stuff because
things just needed testing but really um I would have liked to have popped some
his seeds so they're next on the list but I've got
um a few things that I've picked out for the next run
um I've didn't I've did a they were picked out with some other
things for a run but yeah I just have to test all the other
stuff all the things I've been making
yeah definitely okay not a bad selection so
um I've noticed on your IG that you've been playing around with some kind of
cell culturing yourself something along those lines what you've been doing
yeah I class it more like microcloning really
okay but um yeah you're basically taking um a small amount of the plant
tissue and then you grow it in a sugar solution so
the plants making instead of it doing the photosynthesis and then
getting the sugar from the light you is getting the sugar from the solution
as long as you've got no bacteria in there
then the bacteria can't grow on the sugar and eat the sugar
so everything has to be super sterile that's that's the main thing with it
um and then I'll grow it to tissue stage where it starts to grow
leaf tissue and the the root
will calyx up but then I'll transfer to another solution which will be then for
the root growth um but the reason I got into the tissue
culture was because I had to move everything
so when I moved everything I thought okay if I'm gonna do this I'm gonna get
a tissue culture kit and I'm gonna do this as an extra
backup so I did two extra backups of tissue
culture and moved my mothers to a safe location
so um yeah so it all worked out and I I learned something new and I've been
experimenting with that a little bit um there's a couple of guys that I'm
speaking to on Instagram and one of them's so knowledgeable in
this field and he's bringing out a kit very soon
and I think that's going to be something that
a lot of people will really enjoy using and experimenting and same again
like people looking beyond just the money and want to learn more
about the plant or plants in general the science behind
them and I think these kits are going to be
amazing for them and he's got he's done them so they're in like a little
bag and the bag is like a sterile environment
which is going to really help people at the beginning stage of doing
tissue culture so um I'll be doing a post on my
Instagram page about that and I'm sure he'll be have put in some
links up about the the kits and stuff like that so um
maybe you can get him to send you one so you can try it out
if you've never tried it out yourself what's the success rate on it like
well okay well I've been getting pretty much 100%
yeah okay um the only time I haven't is where I've done little tests so
I've got one out and I breathed into the pot
okay and closed the lid just simple things like this are going to
contaminate it so you've got to wear a mask and stuff like this yeah
so the first batch uh 10% got contaminated
okay the second second time maybe five percent and then after that
really I don't have any problems but I've seen even seen in labs where
they've got total sterile environment they still have five percent sometimes
losses and stuff like this yeah so it happens in the cleanest of
environments so um yeah but
as long as you're you're doing everything super clean and that's why
these kits are going to be really good with the bag
so you've got a sterile environment inside the bag I think that's going to
be really good yeah no that sounds cool it sounds like
you're kind of getting down to the point where you're almost doing
the meristem culturing yourself do you ever plan to do that type of thing or go
to labs for it well no this is what this other guy is
he's like been experimenting with all of this stuff
so and he's even doing like talking about literally
cells um just floating in the solution and even to the point where maybe even
um breeding in uh in um
test tubes so we'll see where it all leads in the future
breeding in a test tube geez ibf seeds
it's more for me it's more just educating myself and
learning these things um um same again like this plant is just
teaching me so much now we're going down the lines of like a
total new line of genetics so yeah all um very interesting stuff
learning something new every day that's another thing i've been
really getting into my a little bit more creative side
so yeah spending a little bit more time doing that
um and i don't know if you've seen in the new
maha kala just like a little limited thing i've done for spinobus
so like a little limited seed packet or like little hand made so
they were quite good doing them oh yeah yeah i've seen you've been
getting your little micro carpentry on yeah that's it yeah yeah keeping busy
being creative keeping the mind busy so it's good with the plants and stuff
like that but sometimes we need to express ourselves in other ways and
learn learning i think it's good to learn something new every day
that's it yeah dude i love it man i love learning
so i got some weird questions but i want to bang them out so first one
when will we see a cbd project from you i'm interested it's due
um maybe when things change in spain and um
i can yeah i'll find a location to start doing a lot more
growing and breeding like the cbd you can actually do out here and stuff like
that and i have some friends that uh
grow legal cbd and so it might be something in the
future that i could work with them but thc and is one of my main things
it's it's the high that these plants produce and that that
thc and the terpenes is just so special for me
um the cbd i think there's other people in other fields
that um make good cbd and can continue with that i'll stick with my
terpene rich thc plants so i mean in a similar idea how do you
think we as a community can cater to the casual smokers and i mean like
this is kind of stemming from the fact how i was saying you know like i've cut
my consumption down and god just like i can't
even have more than one hit and i'm just gone like i need that
i'm like i feel like that old person who's like weed's too strong these days
so like i'm trying to figure out like how can you make kind of like more
tangy type of strains where it like tastes good but doesn't destroy you
but you you'd like the lilt yeah the lilt's like this yeah so
there are some phenos that you smoke and they just like knock you out
but i'd say the majority of the tropical ones
um have this like beautiful euphoric high air people will be smoking and
people will be giggling and that i just i think i think this is going to
be the the perfect strain for summer and how we've got spring coming soon
and summer just around the corner i think it's going to be a
a perfect strain for those sunny days and
summer activities yeah i think this is what's needed
yeah okay so a bit of a weird one but i wanted to ask your opinion because i
think we've spoken about this in kind of the dms but
there was like a scientific paper which came out the other day and it's like
actually detailing how you can use cannabis to
help people wean off harder drugs like meth and opioids
is that any surprise to you at all no no because i've seen so many people
that have been in the cannabis community
and ended up growing and this plant again teaching them so
much and they changed their their way of life
and the cannabis has given them something else
to keep their mind occupied to give them a feeling that they can relax and
stuff like this so i see i've seen it a lot where where
people have had previous uh drug addictions and they've
turned to cannabis and it's helped them through even just
growing the plant never mind taking a plant yeah the plant
taking a plant has helped them amazingly but growing it the whole thing
the therapeutic use and the therapeutic property you get from just gardening
you know changing a lifestyle yeah okay so what type of growth style
have you been using lately okay so with the
um last batch these are all biotops with the
the seeds i'm doing and the ones before that were all on
cocoa because i was running some tests with ph and stuff like this
and the afghans definitely like the a much higher ph so
um this is a handy thing with instagram both the guy from
milana village is on instagram the farmer and the guy from afghanistan
so i can actually like message him or get my other mates a message the other
guy in in because he can speak to him in his
language and get some answers and that and stuff
like this so that's been quite interesting
but it's not something that they really check is the ph and stuff like that but
from a little bit more discussion i found that it's much higher ph there
and i found that with growing them here they just really reacted better with a
much higher ph yeah okay cool and what other little
interesting nicks or quirks have you found about them which
you kind of help cater to like they're like a higher soil temperature
or like medium i should say okay another thing that i was doing with them i
started some of the seeds okay left them in low low level light
above the below the canopy okay just to see how they react
and plucked a few out of the soil stripped the roots down and
replanted them and they still grew here okay so it just
shows how hardy these plants are you can pull
a plant out of the soil break all the small tiny roots off where
you're just leaving the main tapering replant it and the plant carries on
growing okay so this is just a little test to
show how i see how hardy some of these genetics
are that are grown in these places at these altitudes and i
think adding them into some of my genetics and
growing them outdoors i think this is where i'm gonna see i
didn't see one bit of powdery mildew in all of their
fields i've seen powdery mildew on other plants around them
but not on the cannabis not one spot anywhere which was absolutely crazy i
thought whereas when people go to morocco it's
everywhere there so um these hybrids that people grow
in places have problems whereas the natural
varieties from that area don't have the problems so i think
this is going to be something to look into
resistance strains for the future yeah definitely something of huge
interest to a lot of people i want to pull you back to something you
said there though the moroccan valley two questions
one do you think a lot of the hash that comes out of there
has become from plants with pm and like you know i guess we should be worried
and the other thing is have you seen that photo from the dna
guys how they got like that valley in the rift full of like
kosher tangy or something like how do you feel about that
yeah see well they had a load of mandarina things
gingerbread out there at one point and mandarin kush and stuff like this
it's been happening for so long it was amnesia not long ago
before that it was some pakistani strains that they were growing and
mexican strains and people were saying cheese they were growing loads of cheese
out there so things have been growing out there for a
long time um so i think that's just how it is
after the whole hashish thing in in morocco isn't
like it goes back generation after generation it
is is a it's a new thing that was started from
people bringing seeds back from other hash producing countries and stuff like
this so um yeah it's just a progression i think
and that's what's going to happen they want to produce more hash and these
hybrids do it so yeah it's happening you go to jamaica
it's all hybrids in jamaica um so yeah this happens
how accountable do you hold dutch genetics and the dutch breeders for
these issues
um well the dutch seed market was a big part of the market and at one time it
was only dutch seeds there wasn't really any american
companies or anybody else around to buy seeds from
so you could say dna are they american or are they dutch
and they're american but their company was in holland so
yeah um yeah they bought seeds where they could buy seeds it doesn't matter
if they're from dutch or from spanish people or
they'll buy the seeds i think to grow out there
and what i've even heard that they grow the seeds out one year
and the second year they grow the seeds from those seeds
but the third year they don't do it so yeah and that's getting pollinated by
anything so um yeah it's all a bit it's just hash
production isn't it that's that's another thing i suppose
when you start going legal we move away from that sort of thing
yeah it's a bit crazy so unrelated oh no kind of related i don't
know do you plan to make a variety of other
feminized seeds or just kind of the the one-off clone here and there that
really proves itself yeah no i want to make some more
feminized seeds um because people want those um orange
turps sort of mandarin turps in feminized
seeds and like i said before i can probably see them grow being grown
out in morocco and things like this like um
like you said tangy there's some tangy over there and stuff like this
so
another little indoor type of question what's your prediction for the future of
the lighting technology um i can see a lot more people going over
towards uh leds i think um
just for power consumption and stuff like this
um but yeah like i said before though i've been
using gavitas but i'll probably change um soon
i'm looking into a few different ones of myself at the moment
uh lumitech things like that so we'll see see what i go for in the end
okay so a bit of a hot topic at the moment in the community but
how do you feel about the idea of patenting genetics and strains within
the industry and how do you kind of think this would work
in regards to your own work i think patenting
anything in this day and age is all bullshit to be honest
but that's just my opinion yeah it's a plant at the end of the day
so and if someone buy buy the seeds off you um
or if we're talking clones it all depends what you're talking but yeah
i think it's going to be a very hard thing what you're going to have a court
case over it it's just yeah just more
unneeded stress i think it yeah i just wanted to ask you one other
question about when you're in india did you at any point kind of think of
any modern hybrids or you thought this would do well here
yeah but i think if i wouldn't want to take anything there
and then you know that they would start growing here
and you know they would save the seeds from it so i think
taking anything there would sort of destroy their genetics i think keeping
it as it is is the best way um not to take anything there
um but i think a lot of things would do well there yeah
oh yeah i meant more like theoretically like is there any clones in your library
that you like just could off the top of your head be
like yeah that'd do well there person haze the person haze from sonic
i think um i worked with that line a bit and
so a field full of that up so it would be absolutely amazing
yeah wow so what do you feel about the idea of kind of these
genetically modified strains to have like specific cannabinoid and terfene
profiles
um in what way genetically modified like proper genetically modified you're
talking about yeah um
i don't know i don't think there's any need for it i think we can we can do it
all with selection time and space yeah
it's already happening yeah yeah it's not something that i i i would
uh agree with it yeah yeah it'd be interesting to see how it all
plays out um so i did want to ask one question
about the cup i should have asked it earlier you know how we kind of implied
like some cups it's kind of pay to play or pay to win
how would you feel if one of those cups that you really thought was kind of like
you know you got to pay to get somewhere like you just won like would it kind of
restore your faith in the competition we'd be like i guess it's not rigged
yeah it would probably change my opinion what i tend to see is like
third place tends to be the real sort of like the winner and the first two are
the people that have like paid the most for um sponsorship or
whatever but yeah if that happened
yeah i'd be uh i thought we'd have to look at it a little bit differently
something i wanted to ask you what's the weirdest plant mutation you've ever
seen um i think one that i see a lot is like
um you know the flat stem thing yeah yeah plant fasciation yeah that's
it um that where you get like the almost like
the mohawk style bud at the top or like four stems where there should be
two and stuff like this but i've seen a lot of like where you
get the bud growing from the middle of the leaf
yeah um the i seen one recently i think it was
dna genetics put it up and it was like a leaf
with like actually on the actual leaves not in the center of the leaf on the
leaves itself there was little budlets coming out
so little calyx is growing from that so um
i've i've recently had a male with a male parts growing from the center of
the leaf um there was some guys growing
uh one line i can't remember a freak show okay it was called freak show i
don't know if you've seen this one yeah yeah i've seen that one yeah that
one was absolutely crazy but i've never come across anything like
that myself um i've had things come out similar to
like the duck spot where they have that like webbing almost
on the leaves um and yeah i think they're the sort of
main mutations i've come across yeah definitely just in case anyone
wasn't aware of that freak show thing you can go look it up but what i found
most interesting was it actually that plant and i think there
was a male or two that also had similar traits it actually
came from a pack of coastal seeds shout out bob
and the crew over there and it was like a uh
what was it big sir hybrid so i was like oh that's interesting because big sir is
like a weird one already like some people think it's kind of auto flowering
even though it's like a photo period one so
maybe we need to push some of these weird genetics a bit harder
yeah um i spoke to those guys with the freak show
but they're working that line themselves um doing some stuff so it'd be
interesting to pop some of those seeds um i think
definitely people need to when they find that maybe work it a
little bit more so they so it actually becomes a little bit
of a unusual line um i think that's just more
for like just the fun and educational side of
things i would like to do that maybe it can have a place where it could
be grown where people don't want the typical leaves to be seen i think
maybe that's the only i think uh purpose
it could be useful really yeah like a better version of australian bastard
cannabis the abc because i'm pretty confident this uh
freak show one's probably got a better high
yeah they were saying it's got some nice turps to it as well so
but i can see a lot of people wanting to buy that still you know just to grow it
out yeah something something that uh
inspector from csi has taught me is that as little commercial value as some of
these mutations may have they're still very interesting and
worth preserving and trying to progress because who knows what's locked inside
and which may be of use later on yeah yeah exactly exactly anybody that
collects seeds i'm sure they'd want to buy a packet maybe to put in their
library or something like this yeah or as we're talking it last time
they uh collect a packed test and it ends up in
the library that's it yeah yeah exactly oh gosh okay
so do you feel like viruses specific to
cannabis are going to increase given you know the large-scale
commercialization that's going to occur throughout the world in the coming years
yes that will happen um i think breeding maybe more resistant
strains and stuff like that one thing i've been even looking into is like
breeding a line that's uh can produce the same amount
and same growth rates on less water and less nutrients
so like almost like an eco weed i think that'll be maybe something for the
future yeah right it was almost like trying to
get that uh trait out of hemp and put it back
into the medicinal cultivar yeah that's it yeah that's it yeah so
there's always like i think um like you said the commercial thing is
always going to bring more uh problems and those problems will
become resistant to things that people use
and yeah stronger so harder to get rid of in the end
which is a which will be a big problem i can see
so with that being said if you were given the opportunity to grow a field of
say lilt or mandarina in the moroccan river
valley would you capitalize on it or would it be a hard pass
um i think people are gonna buy the seeds anyway
um so uh whether they buy them from morocco or spain
the seeds get sold um i've yeah they've already done some
mandarina kush out there and what else was it orange soda and
i'm trying to think what else uh gingerbread
so there's been a few things growing out there and people send me photos and
stuff like this so yeah interesting and and how would you predict
that it would change the uh the overall effect of those plants
because earlier on you mentioned that um you know when you got some seeds from
the uh the mountains and grew them back here they're much more kind of squat and
indica like compared to when they're in the mountains
so in the reverse situation how do you think your plants would come out when
growing there do you think they'd be more sativa or
yeah give us your ideas yeah a little bit but they
they the gingerbread's a little bit more indica in structure anyway
the other ones are a bit more sativa but the
terpenes um yeah they retain terpene so well with the conditions that they grow
them and dry them and all of this sort of stuff so
it uh puts up with those conditions and make some of the
best hash that's come out of there like yeah
i think one of the guys got the first place in the monsters cup in the span
last year so yeah amazing hash amazing hash gets produced from that
so what strain so far that you've been able to experience makes the best hash
uh the gingerbread and the orange soda the orange soda from la colada
there it was some amazing hash amazing hash
i really enjoyed that yeah wow and then so what are kind of some of the old
school strains of yesteryear that you'd like to see come back
the afghanis they're coming back already i'm seeing so many people growing them
so um we're going to see a lot more old school hash plants i think coming back
these coming years um and i even can see some of the old
sativas coming back just because of the high that they
produce because uh yeah something special in them so i can
see the sativas coming back some of them
may be like old african stuff do you think that it's arguably
inevitable that we do move towards a more sativa orientated
customer base within the community given that of course depressants in general
alcohol opioids there's a huge market for them but when i look at things
globally seems like overall more people worldwide
kind of into stimulants than into depressants
yeah i think a lot of people that i know
like the more indica's just because they use it to relax
and they use it to chill out um maybe get into like artwork and stuff
like that it puts you into like a more sort of meditative sort of state
um but i really like the the sativas as well
like i just enjoy them for the daytime and i find that i can like
really get into anything that i'm doing whether it be in the garden
or in the house creating something or cooking
or anything i'll just really get fully into it with this
with the sativas so what's your favorite sativa
well from from my lines at the moment like i like the
the high from the little it's such a sort of
beautiful um up high and really sort of gets mind-blowing creative
um yeah but from the past um i like sonic's per sang haze
that for me sort of just was such a beautiful smoker enjoyable
um such like up high again sort of gets the mind thinking
yeah really really nice one yeah cool so i want to talk to you about
hazes like what like the term haze is used as a
general term because obviously not every haze has
the original haze or even necessarily a derivative haze in it
do you just feel like haze is kind of a term for like a few land race sativas
kind of doing their thing together um yeah i think haze now is
it seems to be any sativa that smells a certain way
with this like hazy spicy sort of smell that
people sort of associate it with um but yeah i find um
like a lot of things have that similar sort of spice but
they're more on that dry side and so yeah they vary
yeah that that terpene profile is so common isn't it that haze one and i
remember being able to smoke some of uh what was it the c5 haze with bodhi and
the first thing that came to mind when i exhaled is i was like who would have
thought you know c5 haze tastes like haze
yeah this is it it's um what was the one i was smoking a bit of
c4 i think it was is there a c4 i'm not sure it could could well be but
yeah there's there's quite a few different ones but like
they all have that underlining yeah haze terpene it's almost like a
spiced thing that's how i would describe it
yeah yeah more more spiced than just a pure mango thing but when you smell it
you you immediately kind of go yeah this is
where it all delineates from right yeah you see that smell in so many like
different land races as well yeah um i've come across that in in so
many different lines uh from like caribbean and colombian
a lot of colombian stuff over that way and south american stuff
i've smelled it from yeah okay south american that's one that hasn't really
been too delved into is that something you're looking to
explore at all what a little trip to south america
ah if needs to happen it gotta happen right yeah
we'll be talking about a trip to afghanistan so
um afghan black honey black yeah he's he's saying come out there alex is well
up for it from land race legacy so yeah there might be a little
afghanistan mission going on yeah true that's right because when
when we're at the emerald carp and i was talking to a few different people
along with alex from land race legacies um
it was interesting because they were i think it was actually kegue who was
saying to me oh you know this guy's got a british passport he can go to
afghanistan he kind of made the point you know it's a lot harder for us guys
to go there so maybe we need to get our butts over there and make it
happen yeah um i think i'll stand out quite a bit
over there this is my only worry um and uh speaking to my daddy his first
reaction was uh no no no no no
yeah for anyone who's not aware banana man's got a
pretty comprehensive amount of tattoos
okay so what's the kind of one of the more old school breeders whose work you
really admire i like the work that um dj shorts has
done with all of his like stuff um i like the fact
that like all the sort of like the flow the
blueberry stuff like this they were all really good lines
and his breeding style i think was was quite um
interesting to read about especially at a younger age
did you ever read any of the articles where he spoke about
selecting males while on psychedelics no i haven't actually
but now that one that one would be quite interesting because i think this is a
big thing for me like on on mushrooms and even on like
um small amounts of uh dmt and but repeatedly smoking and going in
like yeah they it's almost like the plant speaks to you
yeah and these uh substances guide you so yeah it's going to be
interesting to have a read on them you'll have to send me some links
yeah man i'll dig it up for you but i guess a pertinent question to ask is
our friend um afghan black honey kush he's come up a few times
do you know if he plans to do seed increases or he's more of just like an
awesome contact no i can imagine there are going to be
some seed releases going on and i can imagine um himalayan
connection um he's going to be
probably doing some nice seed releases i think he's got one going on right at the
moment which a lot of the some of the afghan seeds
and stuff like this so yeah they're they're
going on now at the moment yeah awesome and how do you feel that
will affect the community having access to these pure land races
um i think it's gonna really help the community
i think it's gonna be a really good educational tool for
for people um and yeah uh i've it's just like a dream
so like if i had access to some real afghan genetics when i was younger
direct from the farmer from afghanistan like that's pretty an amazing thing so
yeah yeah i feel ya so you mentioned baba kush already
as we know one of kind of the old school clones you're a fan of what other old
school clones struck a chord with you whether you have them or not
the sfv i really enjoyed that one crowberry that's something that we used
to have it was just some seeds that came over it
was on the forum uh days and a guy called monkey had done a
selection and that was a real special plant the
crowberry um what else do i um
some real nice things the lemon larry lemon larry og that was a real nice
special one and the east coast sour diesel always
always such an amazing plant and flavor yeah so i think
those ones from from uh back in the day of the clones on the
forum times yeah crowberry i've never heard of that
what's what's inside that one genetically
okay it's um a granddaddy purple crossed with blackberry
i'm sure i'd have to double check that but
um i ended up using it see look memory goes as you get older
um i used it for the smurf berry cross um and yeah just such an amazing plant
to grow and like it would taste absolutely amazing
down to the roach with this like sort of
berry smell with that typical purple sort of um taste in the background
like purple weed has a certain sort of serpine almost so it was like with that
with this more berry tongue going on but yeah so many people grew that out
it was such a good plant so what do you think will be
basically the next major flavor profile to take a hold on the scene
i think people fruity stuff um people seems to really be liking the
little at the moment um and i'm seeing more people bringing
out pineappley sort of things so i can see maybe that the pineapple
turp coming coming back um
yeah i think that might be a new one to come back around
i see everything coming back around in circles it seems
it's like fashion right like i remember it seems like gas
strains of like kind of snuck back in but also kind of sneaking out and i'm
waiting for the fruity stuff to come back i love that i've got to agree with
gooey breeder on that one that's where i think it's at
yeah yeah fruity definitely that's where i'm at as well i think the fruity stuff
is coming back um i think like everybody that's growing
this little at the moment it's like i was so surprised with the
smell myself when i found that that that pheno like i was
literally just dancing in the room i was just like wow this is amazing and
i just kept going back smelling it and like it's so nice to get those
messages off people they're just like wow i've never smelt anything like this
or this is like just pure tropical juice
papaya people are saying one person was saying he smells like
cream and strawberries with pineapple and i'm just like wow this is yeah
this is this is this is the stuff that people are loving
yeah definitely okay so what do you think about the rise of the vape pens
you know we've seen that glorious south park episode calling it the
pussy sticks um how do you feel it seems to me like
it's the bridge between the everyday joe who's not really a
consumer and our community so to speak do you feel
like it's a good or a bad thing
yeah i think um there's a it's a lot of people are going to use them
just because it's just so easy to use um for the normal everyday person
um yes but i think a lot of shitty materials being used
for them um because i'm seeing if anything's really nice in flower form
it's being sold as flower or maybe make it into
extract or the really nice extract they're using
really nice flower and then the lower grade extract they're using
not so good flower and then it just goes down
down and down and then it seems to be like the shittiest stuff is being used
for edibles and these uh carts and stuff like that
and i'm seeing so many of the carts just not passing tests in america
so yeah education again education so i think a lot of the
issues stemming from those carts relates to people buying the actual
uh housing units the plastic and the um
the little cartridges themselves from china and there's you know
a plethora of associated issues with that do you think that essentially this is
inevitable given that people selling these carts are looking to make money
their game is profits despite the fact they may try to claim it's all about the
patients how do you think you deal with this
conundrum um yeah um
i think more testing and stuff like that um like
you're saying then if they're buying the carts from china and they're
releasing all those toxins into the stuff
yeah like yeah people just it's more education more
research into these things and maybe some more guidelines that
people need to be like sticking to when they are making these products for
a legal market
how do you feel people can ascertain whether the person they're buying off
really has their best interest in mind do you think it's just like you have to
know someone for a while yeah this is where like it goes back to
the whole thing of um going to a farmer's market or going
to a shop um like
big companies are only interested in profit
and most of these carts are being made just for pure profit
so i think there you go it says it there basically so most of
these companies are more interested in profit than
the people themselves um so yeah talking about it more i think
with other people this is where like forums
come into thing again it's a place that we can discuss
these topics openly with lots of people maybe get
somewhere from that
yeah okay um so kind of an extension of that idea of the
vape pens and whatnot how do you feel about the introduction of
non-cannabis derived terpenes to cannabis or even the reintroduction do
you feel like this idea of removing and then adding back is deleterious to the
overall effect
yeah it's not something that um i've really looked into at all
um but yeah i don't think it's something that we should be doing i don't
think there's any need for using non-cannabis derived
terpenes um or if you are what is the reason is
it just for the flavor or is it because those terpenes have a
medicinal use as well so like i think a lot more research
needs to be done in this area um especially about terpenes i think
that's going to be something for the future like um
i think they play a massive role in healing in um
um many other forms the high it creates so yeah more testing needs to be done
definitely yeah i mean something which kind of
opened my eyes a little bit is that everyone always knows that terpenes play
some sort of modulatory role with cannabis you know because a
weed with terpenes gets you really high that same way that's been
in a cupboard for months and it's lost all the terpenes it's just not the same
and you know the presumable implication is that you know the terpenes are the
thing which is causing the main change and then you realize that thc itself is
actually a terpene by definition and to me that really linked it all
together a whole lot more you know and i don't think many people are aware of
that
yeah um no this is it like education on this subject
um and sharing all this knowledge needs to be done on a
more sort of like regular basis um because there's so much to learn about
this plant and it's only the start because we're
only now being able to do the things that we
want to do um i'm still struggling where i am um
but still there are places that we can have things tested
um but america uh they're gonna be able to do so many
different things now now that it's opened up how it has
yeah of course of course so do you think that with the
commercialization of things we've been talking about that there's going to be
this increasing tendency to kind of intellectualize
breeding and that the idea of using a lab to do it will
just become the common and people using first principles to select a male is
just going to go out the window um yeah
um i think a lot of the maybe some of the other companies will maybe go down
this line or like um i don't know if it was you on one of
your interviews was talking about a computer generated breeding program
yeah yeah yeah i can see it going down those lines and stuff but we'll see
how how how they do um and what they make
uh from doing it that way um i think it's all going to be very interesting
but um yeah i don't know if they can i think it's
breeding is a little bit of art as well as science
you know with that being said about the old ways of breeding you know using
your nose and not so much relying on the uh the labs
how long would you be willing to work a line before you call it quits
let's just say you made lilt and there was something about it you weren't happy
with and you're like all right i'll just i'll
just work it for a generation or two i'll fix that up
and it kind of doesn't come you know at least not in one or two generations at
what point would you be like look this has just
been too much of a time sink
um um yeah if it's not doing what i wanted to
after a couple of generations then i'd probably scrap that line
with um if it was like um a certain taste say i was looking for
and i was only getting a certain percentage
i could maybe still release it but explain that you're only going to get
50 percent of this type of pheno um this one and you might get this one or
maybe we used to do this on on on breed bay anyway
like we'd fill out a little form and explain like how many phenos of this
type and stuff like that so maybe like a little bit more of that
should be done anyway
yeah no i i understand so um do you feel like this plays into the
idea of why people have this tendency to release f1s like it seems like
not many people are working lines further and there's obviously a
commercial reason for that because it takes time and money and you're not
exactly evenly compensated like a strain that
goes through several generations of work doesn't go
necessarily for like three or four times the cost of an
how do you think we combat that because there seems to be a like a want for
people to like you know the consumers want breeders to work the lines to
stabilize them more but at the same time if the financial compensation isn't
there how do we encourage it yeah um
yeah this is a hard one like um for me yeah it's it's time so i've been
making a lot more f1s and releasing them
um but during that i will work some other lines and yeah take the time to
do it but i i'm not i don't get any more
uh price on the seeds if anything my more work lines are cheaper than my
f1 lines so yeah
yeah okay so do you feel like maybe the introduction of a standardized
seed pricing model would be a benefit to the community in that you know
everyone sells f1s for around this price everyone sells f2s for around this price
and it enforces like both a floor and a ceiling to the pricing
yeah it'd be interesting but um i think the seed market the pricing is so
varied at the moment um i've increased some prices like the
cherry spice because the amount of the seeds that it produces
is just like so little compared to other other things i pollinate
so um like i think that i've done it like this so i've
tried to work out which lines sort of cost me more to make or have done
and i've tried to do it like this but um yeah it varies so much then you've
got other people just charging 500 or 600 for a packet that's just
built on hype so a pricing would be interesting to see
what people um come up with yeah all right let's let's
delve into this let's get a little bit feisty so cookie fam with that candy
rain they still haven't fixed anyone up for
those issues they had and i'm sure you're well aware of this given the uk is
pretty well in the grips of the hype market
how do you feel about that sitch yeah okay so
you maybe have to explain a little bit to me as well who made the candy rain
exactly was that jigger yeah see i don't know i heard rumors
that it was canerado right okay okay okay
at least he got dragged into it when people were asking for refunds
right okay yeah yeah i'm not too sure but
that's all just crazy again isn't it it's all built on hype
and they've totally released something without testing it
and yeah people have been left a bit very disappointed i suppose
yeah okay so do you feel there's an onus on
500 f1 packs to replace seeds if they don't germinate
yeah i think i think things have happened in the past
when we were online i think it was a ic mac this was on
or maybe one of the other forums um but somebody had made a line i won't go
into like who it was and stuff like that but somebody made a line and they were
auto flowering for some reason because when they were
testing them they they tested them as seeds and just put
them into flower without vegging them too much
so um and that guy replaced people's seeds and
made the effort to do that so i think i think yeah it's you need to
stick by your product so if you've made a mistake try to um
give something back to the people that have put money in your pocket
yeah for sure so i mean i feel like i've already dug this hole so i may as well
keep digging would you ever buy some cookie fam seeds
no um i could never pay for that price if they gave me a pack for free i might
pop them just see what they were like and so how do you feel about the idea of
these crews who can't even necessarily prove the uh
the clear lineation of them creating the seeds having parental stock etc
releasing seeds because from my perspective you know
and and i'll caveat this by saying any anyone from cookie family wants to come
on the show hit me up dude but um but with that being said you know
there's no clear evidence to me that like this wasn't a
mistake so the idea that they're now releasing seeds under the guise of like
oh well we made this it's like did you really and the seeds
you're releasing are they going to be any good even
yeah um i think it's just some i know people personally that bought a
packet and stuff like this like um
it's just unbelievable and it's just all built on that that that hype again and
people get sucked into it we see it with so many other things
um with other products that you buy that you
it's not a superior product but you're buying it because of the name on it
if you know what i mean yeah no i feel you
so just to kind of uh get ourselves out of this hole quickly
but equally kind of controversial how would you react and how would you feel
if someone you know kind of put a post up on instagram
and it was like oh i've got s1s for sale soon of mandarin of
lilt of perceng hayes you know all of these strains like how would that make
you react
yeah like an s1 um yeah it's a little i think that would be a little bit
too much but to be totally honest i don't even think it'd bother me i i i
don't let too much bother me nowadays um
so um but i can understand like if someone's say my mandarin
someone's s1d it um i'm sure they did that in morocco to be honest you know
and grew up the seeds and grew up the seeds and grew up the seeds
so and someone asked me the other day could they
um feminize and make an orange soda for somebody that wants the seeds
and i'm just like well to be honest with you it's probably something i'm gonna
remake myself at some time i've had a few people make things that
i might was thinking of sort of making and they've done the cross from seeds
that they bought and stuff like that but it's not going to be like how i
would make it anyway because of my selections
like you can give someone the same ingredients but will they sort of cook
the same meal like yeah so it doesn't really matter too
much but then i like to see that as well i like to see people use my genetics and
maybe make something of their own from them by crossing
something together so um yeah i've seen a lot of people have
been using the cherry spice a few people have started using the
lill with some crosses so yeah um it's it's nice to see them
being used and that they they think they're good enough to use
compared to everything else that they've been growing
which is really good but they've grown them out it's like i see people just
crossing stuff wanting to cross stuff together before they've even grown them
out which just doesn't even make sense to me
so at least they're doing some selection
yeah it's weird people not doing that selection but just to link back to your
other point our mutual buddy organically enhanced he
he made some crosses with his cherry spice keeper he found i think he even
used some mac pollen which definitely going to create an
interesting cross but perfect segue to my next question thanks
for bringing it up save me a bunch of effort
how do you feel about other companies using your work
in their crosses like do you feel overall it's a positive or sometimes it
can be detrimental yeah it's never really been a problem
for me um like saying now somebody uses the
mandarina in the cross and someone does grow that out and they
like that then they'll want to grow out the real
mandarina because you find so many different phenomes in the mandarina like
that but some better some some like more sweet some more sour
so like i think people are always gonna go
to the original once they find something that they like
from the crosses um so yeah it's never really been a
problem for me um but
yeah it all depends if you're if you're worried about take them taking business
from you yeah i think that's gonna happen anyway
people are gonna buy seeds from elsewhere that taste like orange
yeah but if it's got mandarin or in it or it hasn't got mandarin in it so
yeah yeah okay so what is the end goal of trichome jungle
seeds i know it's a bit of a broad question but i mean
do you kind of plan to do like a bit of a body and start another seed company
for kind of alternative releases that wouldn't maybe otherwise fit under the
banner of trichome jungles or is it just to kind of stick to what you've already
got and you just kind of do whatever you want
within that context there might be another company working
with some other people um which will be um maybe based in the
caribbean um but myself i'll do like different
lines like the cherry spice and they were part of the finest
selections um i've got a few other new things coming
up um so like i'll definitely make new like
my standard lines would be i would say um mandarin jungle coach mantis things
like this and then i had a bunch of lines that
were like a feminized line and then i stopped making them then i
did the rose water cookie line i stopped making them um i'll work the
rose water cookie by itself now which is the which is the real
um and then i did the finest selection line
um i've dropped one of them i might drop a couple more
we'll see i'll the cherry spice and a little just becoming very popular so i
probably will continue to make them um and then i'll look for something else i
just there's so many things i need to work
through and so many different flavors and things
like uh it's just time again i need a big big space and a couple of
years and yeah um
be blowing some minds with uh the flavors and things
yeah okay so i've got a random question i wanted to ask um so
what's your favorite food food um okay uh
i'll eat a lot of avocados um fuck yeah and papaya papayas i love papaya
um but like here where i am you you can get lots of papaya that's
grown here lots of avocados um
yeah so it's absolutely amazing for that um but my diet is a vegan based sort of
diet and all plants um
so yeah so another little random question what's your favorite music and
i hope you have a soft spot for uk grime
yeah i i do i i do like there's a few uk um artists that i like from
sort of like the hip-hop type scene and stuff like this
i i like loki but he's a little bit more political and stuff like that
but my music is so buried like prodigy i love prodigy and he he passed away the
other day yeah so so yeah um
but like i'll listen to anything from psy trance to
uh mantras and buddhist chants and i don't know rock music to
uh hip-hop there you go that's that's that's how varied my music is
oh dude i'm gonna have to send you a link to the the dj mix bodhi gave me
it's fucking great okay yeah definitely definitely i'll be
well up for listening stuff hell yeah so get us back on topic for a
minute um do you have any plans to do any
kind of specific feminized releases so like a range of f1 feminized seeds or
not overly yes there will be some more feminized
seeds being released at some point um i'm going to try and make a
feminized lil and a few other lines just so they can people other people
can try them so many people want feminized seeds and
i'd love them to be able to try this like the little and the tropical
so yeah definitely a few more feminized lines in the works
yeah cool and do you feel like when you feminize things you want to kind of
reserve it for the things that really prove themselves or would you be willing
to do like an initial cross and release as a feminized line or
as i said do you feel like it's reserved for stuff that's proven itself
yeah it all it all depends in how it comes out in the testing
um and um like i couldn't i couldn't release the feminized
mandarina that i made um so they were just producing
um hermaphrodites and stuff like that so i wasn't happy with them
um but that was an s1 so i think if i use the two mandarinas
that i have instead of just using the one on one
on itself um that would have worked out better
but yeah i think um some things just don't work
and just yeah other things uh we see how it works and
yeah okay so how would you feel if you had a project you really wanted to
release it you're getting some awesome results from the seeds but like let's
just say one in every 30 or maybe one in every 40
seeds was like just a horrific hermaphrodite
is that is that at the point where you'd be like nah i got a
you know 86 this or do you feel like it's the type of thing where you would
just kind of want to be up front with that information and be like it's still
worth it but you know just keeping it keep an eye out for that
yeah i think if if you're gonna get like
one hermaphrodite um in a hundred seeds
i don't see that as a major thing um especially if you're using certain
things like we'll say cherry pie
for instance um i see it a lot with crosses of um
cherry pie uh strains um but i find like they'll it's not even
like a proper hermaphrodite sometimes it'll be just like a male bit that you
pick off and you don't see any more after that
so um i think it's going to be something that you see i think things
with sour diesel in it is another thing that it'll spring up
um so but the cherry pie has been an interesting one i'm seeing like almost
like baba kush like la afi type traits coming out from a lot of these like
cherry pie crosses and stuff like this yeah okay and so i mean
cherry pie is a great example because it's one of those ones where even when
people are growing it just for the bud um people will comment you know you get a
few little nanas on the lower branches maybe they're not getting enough light
maybe there's something else at play do you feel like these clones are still
worthwhile breeding with or kind of that issue i mentioned is a bit
problematic in the grand scheme of things
um it can be problematic in the grand scheme of things
um it can mess up someone's whole grow really
um but i think if people are aware that these genetics sort of there is
that chance of them doing it um yeah
i don't know see some of them are just like what i tend to do is try and find a
cherry pie cross and select from that
which don't have the hermaphrodite tendencies and then work from there
so i do a lot of my stuff from seeds and not the original clone so i'll make sure
that they're like cherry pie and girl scout cookies
is the the parents and then from the selection
find a plant that doesn't show any of those traits that you don't want
and work from that so that's where i would go down the line of doing
try and find a terpene that you want without the other traits
for sure okay so we're on to our last little quickfire question
so hopefully we're not doubling up too much but maybe some things have changed
since we last talked but first off what is the best smoke you've had
recently that comes to mind um sourneo and cherry spice
which i'm really enjoying at the moment yeah do you try many stuff outside of
your own or not often um yes out of some of the new stuff so
uh the skittles i've got to try all the new like american elite stuff
and the skills to gelato um runts um a few other different ones
lemon tree all of these so yeah um i've got to try them i'm really
enjoyed the skills um that was a real nice um
flavor to it so i'd like to work that line maybe into some of my things that
would be quite interesting i think okay and i'm sure you probably copped
wind of it you know a few months back just before december we
had a big kind of kerfuffle in the industry about how
the big al mac 100 dollar eighths were selling and people weren't too happy
about that how do you feel about that and the
emergence of this premium cannabis market yeah well it's the same in
in barcelona to be honest like i think that's what
skills and stuff like that sells for like basically
and it's like 100 euros and for three grams or something like this
fuck even more than america yeah yeah it's coming from it's probably
so there you go so um yeah crazy prices
absolutely crazy prices okay yeah i've even seen amsterdam you go
to amsterdam and they've got it on the menu there for
like 40 euros a gram and stuff and how do you feel about the culture of
import cali you know do you feel like it's destructive to the local producers
so to speak no i think if something's coming at that
higher price selling for that higher price then
maybe local grows get a little bit better price
i think it's when um people start coming in and selling like really like
shit extract because there's so much extract in america now
made from like just crap and stuff like this
that's going for so cheap like then that comes over to places like
spain and that brings the prices right down i
think that can affect things maybe yeah okay and then just to kind of wrap
up our little hype section what's the most overhyped strain that
gets sold for lots of money most overhyped stream
like i've heard i haven't had it myself so i'll give that caveat but i've heard
like runts and grunts and all that stuff's like
not that great um runs itself the one that i tried was
was quite nice um but then i suppose it's batch
dependent the purple punch that i tried was
was very lacking yeah purple punch um not all that some of the gelatos
some of them weren't even that that nice it would but then it all depends
you know who who's grown it and stuff like this
but i think anything that's that sort of price is
overpriced uh i tried some mac that was that was
nice but then i had another one that wasn't that good
so it all depends again who grows it or if it's from the seed or if it's a clone
yeah definitely right i remember the 2017 emerald cup capulator gave me some mac
phenomenal probably standout weed of that emerald cup
and then yeah i had some grown by a good grower
admittedly it was outdoors but um looked amazing organic sun grown just ticked
all the boxes but then when i tried it it just wasn't
anywhere near as good at all so maybe it comes down to like the grower i mean
obviously cap's gonna grow some pretty darn good mac yeah i
think that that's gonna play a big role um
like you said then i i wasn't impressed with it but then i've spoke to other
people and they're like nah it's it's it's absolutely amazing so um
yeah i must must depend yeah okay so outside of the hype strains
what's one of the you know most lackluster
samples you've tried in recent memory
something i've enjoyed in spain oh something you haven't enjoyed like for
example what's kind of the worst yeah what's
what's the worst strain you've ever had okay okay okay sorry um
worst one recently i'm gonna say that purple punch was really lacking because
i expected it to be much nicer with the hype yeah
there's lots of things like that have been lacking from a lot of the like
spanish seed companies i've seen but yeah yeah okay
so one of my favorite ones desert island question
you can take three strains with you and you got an infinite supply of them you
don't have to worry about growing them or anything like that so which three
strains you taking with you um lilt
sour neo and the cherry spice those three from mine
so i've got something sour something gassy
something fruity and i'd probably miss the mandarina
oh poor mandarin it's still got a spot in our hearts
yeah it's because i smoke too much of it now i think i miss it after a few
weeks almost a little bit of tangy syndrome
yeah that's it all righty so final question for the
interview what is your next strain coming out that
you're most excited about um salinia there you go i've mentioned
it quite a few times now um yeah really enjoying that one and
um looking forward to see what comes from
the afghan crosses i've just done yeah actually no let's slide an extra
question in for good measure now that you've got your afghan landry
seeds i believe last time we spoke i asked you you know if you could go
anywhere collect some landry seeds what would you do and i think you said afghan
so now that you got them what's next on the list of stuff that you don't have
that you'd love to get yeah um it's crazy how that happened
actually how you asked that question and then we were going to india and my
mate called me and he's like there's a guy from afghanistan he's
coming and he's bringing some real afghan seeds with him
it's just so crazy how that happened so let me see let's see if i can put it
out there and get the next one and some iranian seeds some oh some
persian seeds iranian persian that would be nice
oh god yes i've had the pleasure of trying um
australian bodies iraqi which is you know they say it's probably persian and
god it's like a bakery it's just it's amazing you smoke this plant and
you could be fooled into being told that it's like just a cookie cut
like it's incredible yeah that's it that sounds that sounds that
sounds like my cup of tea that yeah hell yeah well i think that just about
brings us to the end of it did you have any shout outs or comments
you wanted to make um yeah i'd like to shout out everybody
that i went to india with uh landrace legacy
and indian landrace exchange sonic sonic seeds uh himalayan connection
