Alrighty a big hello and welcome to episode 38 of the podcast, a cannabis podcast for
budding enthusiasts.
As always we want to give a big thank you to our sponsors.
Radio Ridge Nursery, these guys have all the pre-mowed cuts from the best breeders including
the newest from Fic Farms.
All these cuts clean as a whistle and save you the time for pheno hunting.
However, they don't have every cut on earth and so if what you're looking for they don't
have, maybe you should head on over to Seeds here now, grab yourself a pack or two, find
that key for pheno for yourself.
Guarantee on satisfaction not just germination.
Hit them both up, Radio Ridge Seeds here now, they got what you're looking for.
As well as always a big shout out to 420 Australia and Organic Gardening Solutions.
Abroski's from Down Under holding down the fort.
Big shout out to the Patreon gang who helped make the show happen.
And last but not least, big shout out to our guest for this episode, the dynamic duo that
is Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
We're joined today by Josh and Kelly for another wicked installment of organic growing and
health knowledge.
So let's get into it.
So let's get into it.
All righty, a big thank you and welcome to two of my favorite humus beings for taking
the time to join us again today for the second time, Josh and Kelly of Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
Thanks so much for sitting down and chatting with us today.
Thank you so much for having us.
Thanks so much for having us.
We're really excited to be here with you this evening.
Right back at you.
So the first question I wanted to ask is the normal first question but it wasn't the first
question I asked you last time.
So it's time to do it.
What was your first experience with cannabis?
My first experience with cannabis was in utero because my mother liked to smoke hash while
she was pregnant and it just felt good to her.
And she was an old hippie of the area and maybe she had some morning sickness or some
different things she was working out.
But really she was just a naturalist that was living in Southern Oregon and just wanted
to be in nature and that was just part of her medicine.
And so as I grew up I was always surrounded by it and luckily I was in Southern Oregon
so we saw the first sticky kind buds coming in and the Oregon big buds and the purple
cushions and I was just lucky enough to always be around it.
I really never had to smoke the Mexican brick weed and different stuff that people had to
smoke.
And so as I grew up I just always had good cannabis around and so that started my love
and I never did any other hard drugs or any other things in life because that was just
a good print for me.
So that was my introduction and then me and Kelly met when I was just 19 and that's a
long time ago now 26 years but we've had a journey in life since then as well.
So that's something we've already talked about.
And my first experience ever was I wasn't like Josh at all.
I grew up in Virginia and was super conservative you know very yeah East Coast conservative
family so I never really saw it around.
You know I never had grown up with it.
I never saw it around and then I went out skiing in Wyoming when I was probably about
14 years old and a bunch of skier hot shots were up on top of the mountain and everybody
was lighting up joints and I thought hey I think I'll take a hit of that.
And we were at the very top of the mountain and a huge snowstorm came through and it was
a total white out and I was stoned for the very first time in my life and it was awesome.
It was so great.
I felt like wow I could see through the white out and I'm the best skier in the world and
this is amazing.
So like Josh I never really went into every happy drugs or got in really to anything maybe
alcohol for a very very short time in my life but cannabis has been a part of my life ever
since that day.
How important do you feel it is to try to have like a really positive first experience
and how much do you think it affects people going forward in terms of whether they're
willing to try it again whether they enjoy it overall?
I think that it's definitely you know that first time is a really important time.
It's sort of like it's important I think to have a really good experience and now more
and more people are able to have good experiences I think because people have an understanding
of the different values of oil or hash or whether it's a joint and even the youth have
sort of an understanding and it's at the fingertip you know you can go onto the internet and
you can learn so much about different cannabinoids and what they might do to you and stuff.
But I think you know for us at the very beginning I know for a lot of people that are my age
Mexican brickweed was pretty much like the first experience that they had because that
was what was available you know in the late 70s and into the early 80s.
That's all that I saw and I think a lot of people didn't necessarily have a very good
experience with it maybe because of the way that it was cultivated or maybe because you
know it was actually really incredibly strong whether the cannabinoids show that it was
super high THC or not it just seemed like those flowers that were coming from Mexico
at that time are really strong so people were having not necessarily a great experience
you know just with that.
There's a lot of ways that cannabis is given out nowadays too so I mean one could have
a first experience in so many different ways it could be Phoenix tears it could be medibles
and so you know there's wine and I would take it maybe even one step further and just say
you know from a biological standpoint we have you know more receptors in our body CB1 receptors
in our body than any other receptors so we may or may not be you know having a complete
endocannabinoid system you know some people may have taken pharmaceutical drugs maybe
some people have antibiotics whatever it was maybe they haven't been close to nature and
so maybe their first experience was like wow you know a neurological you know completion
to it was almost a shock to their system and that could be you know something that that
would really affect your first experience and it could be overwhelming you know at times
but I think that once you start you know finding the right dosage or finding the right medicine
that works for you you know you do start completing your endocannabinoid system which then allows
you to heal in ways that you know is adaptogenic and your immune system can decide what it
is so you know a first response is could mean a lot of things based off you know you're
and I think when you're when your endocannabinoid system is really flooded you're definitely
gonna have a much better you know experience mentally and emotionally as well so I think
that it's really I always tell people if you didn't have a very good experience the first
time it's probably because you know your endocannabinoid system is a lot like a dry sponge it takes
a while for the cannabinoids to sort of be uptaken by by the body and once that happens
I think the chances of having a good experience are way better.
And some people don't even get high on their first smoke you know it's like you hear a
lot of people oh I didn't feel anything and then two three times later and then by the
third time you're like oh yeah I got it you know and so that's that's really interesting
too and I think that just speaks to the molecular biology and and the natural medicine that
it is so yeah.
Yeah some really really interesting points you raised there one I just want to touch
back on quickly is how I think Kelly you mentioned how you know some of these Mexican strains
had such potency to them a lot of people speak about this idea of how some of the strains
people think back on when they first started smoking and they'll talk about them as if
they're just so much stronger than the stuff today and then the counterpoint is raised
that well because good weed was kind of so sparse and it was just near and far in between
where you'd get it it it emphasized that and it maybe makes people feel like things were
more potent than they were do you feel that's the case or do you feel that there truly was
this very unique profile back then which really did make things just kind of blow your socks
off.
Well I mean you always hear oh people bred out the CBD and they just only bred for the
high and they only bred for THC which means that at one point there was none of that happening
so that's the early 70s and the late 60s so at that time you would think there would be
potentially a more complete or wide range of cannabinoids at the time I would I would
think you know people's talk about how I smoke a whole lid you know was the term back in
the day and you know and it wouldn't get you totally ripped but it would just be like a
beautiful high and you know it was like the flower power and the beautiful things of the
60s and 70s back to the land all that was really done like on that kind of herb and
in that kind of medicated state so I also know that you know I think it's kind of known
that the Columbia Colombian gold was was really strong you know and or the Acapulco gold was
you know really strong too and and the and the Wahak and some of the walk and streams
were known to be really strong so I don't think that I've seen cannabinoid reports from
back in those days but that's my gut feeling.
Yeah and I think my take on that would be that the terpene ratios are you know really
important when we talk about that I think that you know in the inner breeding that we've
done you know all the way to this point now from you know back in the late 60s we're really
breeding for different types of terpene ratios and we keep seeing the mercine you know going
up and up you know so a lot of terpene profiles are starting to be bred out of it and I think
when you have a really full rich terpene profile then you have more of a chance of
like getting sort of that psychedelic feeling you know when you have full cannabinoid full
terpene I mean and I and I've even seen that now in tests I'd be like you know that one
really sort of felt a little bit trippy I felt a little hallucinogenic with that and
maybe that's what people are talking about because I can think about you know my first
joints it was all the Mexican brick weed and I was actually going into it was at school
in Arizona for a short time and I mean that's the way I made my way through college was
sort of swinging that around and I definitely feel like that flower did create a hallucinogenic
effect every time that you smoked it and I could say the same thing about the original
purple tie stick that people used to get a hold of or just the tie stick that was another
one that really sort of created like that hallucinogenic feeling and maybe that's what
people are talking about when they talk about you know getting really high maybe they weren't
getting necessarily really high but they were feeling sort of that hallucinogenic psycho
you know the terpenes do play on that and if you traveled to Mexico in the back you
know throughout your life you may have seen better Mexican weed you know then when it
got bricked you know it is true it you know it affect the terpenes and so you know you'd
lose a lot of that and it is sad there was paraquat was a was a really big part of you
know the growing in the Mexican weed and when my dad was was dying of cancer he had a medical
intuitive that was saying that the paraquat that was in the Mexican brick weed that the
governmental agents just sprayed from the air from helicopters was you know was really
in that herb right there so that's that who knows what other and that could have maybe
made you feel more high or psychedelic too you know what was being added to it but anyway
that those are some thoughts really really interesting ideas and it raises my next point
which is where do you think we're going to go with terpenes next and the reason why I
asked this is because I feel like you know to kind of lend from the school of thought
of Bodhi that terpenes are almost like a gateway or cannabis these days is almost like a gateway
drug to like wanting to discover terpenes more you know like I feel like it's only kind
of natural or intuitive to want to get more into like kind of perfumes and alchemy and
just generally exploring it more because something I've noticed is like when I've got some incense
burning or I've maybe smelled some oud recently if ever I smoke I seem to get way more high
even though the terpenes aren't necessarily from the cannabis itself so where do you think
we go next with terpenes?
Well I like that we have the ability to explore different strains and there's a market for
it and there's consumer interest in it and there's more education on terpenes and when
you really just start analyzing strains simply from the standpoint of is it high in myrcene
or high in THC or not it's amazing how many strains are high in myrcene and that's been
said you know many times so when you get into high you know beta-osamine or terpenoline
or you know different strains like that it's a it's part of getting high it's I mean it's
urine it's just like food you know you're letting down saliva or different compounds
in your mouth as you smell things and that's like a pre digester to your food it's just
like kind of a pre high to smell the weed I mean that's why you want terpene you know
ratios in your in your lab test to be you know three percent to six and you know maybe
seven percent would be amazing because that's part of the high.
So terpenes you know there's food terpenes there's if you're gonna extract terpenes and
add terpenes to food and use essences you know that's a that's a really big open market
there's countries that won't allow cannabis derived terpenes and there's ones that will
but there's also people in the cannabis industry that use food grade terpenes and did you want
to talk about that or?
Yeah no but yeah so the the food grade terpenes are you know that's not necessarily made to
the same standards or the same purity that can happen you know ganja terpene maybe made
so having cannabis derived terpenes is you know a really really good thing for medicine
and for being able to use it in food and different different drinks.
And what I see in the industry right now which is what Josh just touched on is that
the more that we abuse this plant and the more that we continue to grow her in a synthetic
environment and the more that we disregard ecology and disregard the environment and
microbiology the more that the plant is going to react she's an adaptogen she adapts so
she's going to adapt to whatever environment that you put her in and what we notice is
that you can take a full spectrum cannabinoid plant with full spectrum terpenes in it you
can put it in a in an environment where she's not being you know taken care of and not being
regarded in a very high manner and what's going to happen is that all of the terpene
ratios go away THC rises and the mercine rises so to me that tells me that those are both
stressors there are stressors within the plant that that's what she does when she starts
to adapt now you can maybe even take that plant that's super high mercine and really
high THC you can put it into a deep soil beautiful living bed outdoors under the sun and then
you'll really start to understand what the full genetic is of that plant I don't think
that the way that we are growing now in the way that we're trading these genetics that
we think are just the bomb and the fire you know is very respectful to the plant so I
feel like she's reacting by you know lowering her terpene and hiring her THC counts and
I think that the future of the medicine is nootropic I mean and also you know full spectrum
and and it's really important to have nutraceuticals over the pharmaceuticals to where the plant
is being used and I think that when people are being given a choice on what they want
to smoke or what they want to ingest if they have a choice between a plant that hasn't
been very respected and is put into these heavy synthetic environments with high mercine
and high THC as opposed to something that has been totally respected and is able to
show its full value and its genetics they're going to choose that full spectrum plant so
I'm really hoping that in the future more and more people have an ability to be able
to experience the two different varietals and be able to experience you know full spectrum
and I would like to think that that's going to be the future of the industry with terpene.
And I think the reason why the terpenes you know are better or last longer with living
soils because they have the fungal filaments in the roots eating the microbiology and really
adding you know the right waxes and the right terpenes and the right gases within the within
the trichomes for the cure to last right you know if it's grown synthetically or you know
hydroponically it doesn't necessarily have the same body of flavor you know in the long
run and it may not last you know longer than two weeks and still be fresh but when a when
a plant is grown when we say respectfully we say you know in a in a in a living soil
that's really active and and adding metabolites to the soils and to the plants so the reason
why it's better is because it has a complete system that it's working with with which allows
it to complete its system so.
And I think that a good way to for people to understand it is I just believe like that
high THC high mercine is really the cortisol of the plant it's the plant showing its stresses
and then when you have a plant that has full terpene and full cannabinoid ratios that that
plant is just really full of serotonin it like has all of the happy things and I believe
that you really feel that as well you know when you're ingesting a plant that's happy
you're going to have a way higher chance of of having a better experience.
Of course so many points we need to touch on but I mean the first one which comes to
mind is when you reference kind of you know growing the plant respectfully and how that
means in a really nice well-catered organic matter to me it raises the idea of is it possible
because I'm not sure myself is it possible to grow quote organically in a cocoa medium?
Well you know then you just start getting into terms you know so I mean yeah it's possible
to have probably like for the you know the USDA which is just you'd have to check your
country you know but I'm sure that you could just use organic products that are certified
and say yeah it's organic but from our standpoint you know the organic has been hijacked in
that from that perspective and and that's why regenerative makes a lot of sense to us
because to say the word regenerative really means you're regenerating life which means
you have living soils and so those soils are aiding in the medicine and that makes the
medicine better so you know to have a more diverse soil is going to be more regenerative
and from our perspective more natural and and better than organic.
And then you're really addressing the endophytic reaction which is within the plant which is
something that we're just absolutely you know fascinated with because I'm incredibly fascinated
with the human microbiome as well so if you take a plant and you're growing it in cocoa
and you're giving it organic amendments like what Josh says sure you can say that it's
grown organically but was it grown naturally was it grown in a biological way the answer
would be no because you're not really creating any biology in your cocoa coir there's no
living food web there's no you know microbiology and it really doesn't allow the plant to reach
its full potential because a full potential of a plant is when you have maximum endophytes
within it and it's all working within the soil and all the way up to the leaves it's
it's a complete cycle and microbiology you know it's like well you can you can say that
you could be on an organic diet too like if you you know are you are getting fed through
an IV tube or something like that you can say well you could put organic you know nutrients
into the IV and the person can stay alive and you can say well they have an organic
diet but they're completely passing the microbiome which is the digestive system which is the
same as when you're you're taking away that living soil attribute so is that person who's
you know living on this organic IV diet gonna have the same you know full immune stimulus
response as the person who's using their digestive tract in a full living microbiome you know
the answer is no it's really no different for a plant of course of course reminds me
of like a use it or lose it attitude but it raises a very interesting point around
classifications and certifications I've long been very skeptical of the OMRI certification
I'm sure a lot of people are as well you can it takes you know no less than five seconds
to find a product that's clearly not organic that has an organic certification on it so
it raises the question do we just look to avoid it and just go based off things you
know for sure are organic because you often hear people say I don't use anything from
a bottle but at the same time there are some products I use that come from a bottle that
I know are full well organic so how do you kind of navigate this minefield as it may
be well you touched on something really important which is OMRI. OMRI is a registration it is
not an organic certification and if you go on to OMRI's website that's the first thing
that they say it's a registry and the language is really powerful and important because OMRI
will state that this is you know able to be used in an organic...
For use in organic agriculture. Yeah for use in organic agriculture but it's still up to
the third party certifier on whether that's organic or not so it's it's only a registry...
created within that system that says you know you if you didn't have a product available
when in need you know that you had the ability to use a chemical here and there and so and
so we you know and this is not just a philosophy so we have over the years been very we have
products as you know you know so we've had all of our products tested so we're testing
raw materials for 12 years now and and we you know we're really aware of what's where
there's glyphosate you know and the glyphosate is just one compound you know there could
be the combo or just there's a thousand other compounds but that are defoliants and whatnot
but so but we're careful about that so you know do you look for a certification well
you know I think at this point it's just a matter of education you know if someone says
they're biodynamic you know that may or may not be to the USDA standards or it may but
you would probably feel pretty good about it because you know the biodynamic standards
are strong and people are really of the earth that are doing that and they're making the
world a better place you know other other organic standards that are based solely on
products so you can have an organic product in a bottle but it if it's it still has to
have a stabilizer in it and usually that stabilizer is a small percentage of non-organic
compounds so I mean from our certification we really recommend against anything in bottles
and go with raw materials because that's just the closest thing that you can get to something
that's natural which is going to feed your microbiology if you're getting something in
a bottle if it's not like expanding and blowing up in the bottle then it's not alive really.
If it's in a liquid.
You know it's being stabilized and I'm not saying it's not useful because obviously people
are using things in bottles and growing plants so it's it's not that it's just if you want
to regenerate life on earth you have to go you know beyond beyond the bottle and so that's
you know we have our certification and we've gone beyond just certifying products like
our certification is not okay give me a list of products you know and let's go through
this this process of deciding whether there's heavy metals in them or or maybe you know
something like pyrethrins or something that's gonna fail a test so what we do is we say
okay well let's try and grow it naturally let's try and enhance our natural biome and
our natural plants so certifications can mean a lot of things and and and it really is a
it takes education to learn what each certification is about.
Yeah of course so would your rule of thumb in general be you know if you want to something
from a bottle so to speak just make it yourself?
I mean that's what we suggest.
I think also you know we we created the certification and we've actually even had people say well
it's so romantic you know it's like something that people could only strive for and maybe
not or only dream of and not really do and the reason why we created the standards that
we created which is really utilizing as many closed loops as you can whether you're an
indoor gardener whether you have a tiny little small plot in your backyard there's still
so many easy things that you can do to become closed loop and it wasn't because it just
is sort of this romantic idea what we're realizing is that the more closed loop that you are
and the more vigilant that you are about what is to your plants then you don't even
have to sweat it when somebody buys your whole stock and they turn it into a contract because
what we're seeing over and over again is people that are organic certified and they're following
all the organic you know certificate or all of the organic registering products out there
that they're still failing yeah and Department of Agriculture is like yeah thumbs up it's
so awesome you could totally do this this is organic it's USDA or it's Canadian certified
or whatever it is then the the flowers are concentrated and they fail heavy metals tests
they fail all different kinds of crazy tests because they're they're concentrating it because
it's becoming concentrated so whatever was in that flower what was ever in the soil or
whatever it was in your your soil is medium is going up into your flower this idea of
like oh you can flush it out you know we always thought it was a joke and now science
is proving it to us that it's a joke you know it doesn't just flush out it goes up into
the plant and it stays there for its duration and it stays there all the way until you know
it's done and then you turn it into a concentrate and it becomes really apparent and there's
too many farmers out there that have lost their entire crop because it's turned into
a concentrate and they fail a test so it's really beautiful it's like cannabis is giving
us this beautiful opportunity right now to look at our food sources to look at big agriculture
to look at the what we're feeding our plants to all of a sudden have a look at the apples
that are you know in the store and wonder geez you know what's in this because now I
know with cannabis testing it's just really leading the way and and it's not surprising
because it's a master plant and it's what she she does well she gives us different ideologies
and she gives us you know different keys and and solutions you know when we ingest her
and also when we cultivate her and it's not just you know because we don't believe in
the system it's just when we you know we've learned that 75 million tons of topsoil have
been lost since the Industrial Revolution and we know that you know there's a million
species on earth that are you know potentially going extinct maybe the Great Barrier Reef
is dying you know so what we're trying to say is you know our certification is certifying
farms when we say that we're regenerative we know we're regenerating life on earth and
it's really meaningful to us and we're we're growing medicine that's beyond just the term
organic is the term organic at this point is just a sort of a word that's just been
you know hollowed out by the system you know and so what we're doing is we're you know
these these closed-loop systems are creating ingenuity on the farm so you know we can put
a carbon back into the soil because agriculture you know releases up to 12 gigatons of CO2
a year I mean there's there's so many reasons why we have to do better and we know the small
farms have to save the earth so we're creating small farm webs that are saving the earth.
That brings us to a perfect next point which is that I've had a lot of people message me
from both around Australia and New Zealand and even some other distant parts of the world and
all of them ask questions along the same line which is you know how can I become a pure farm
myself maybe not in a farm sense but you know how can I try to get my little tent or my little
you know backyard plot as closely aligned with the dragonfly ethos as possible and I guess it
raises an interesting point you know will you guys be looking to expand internationally with
the certification? We already have we we already are international and that's the beauty of this
is because it's community run and community involved and it really is creating sort of a
network you know as the web gets wider the weave gets tighter and we all have an understanding you
know Josh and I go out and we do consultations or we or we talk to people and I always say you
know people like whoa that was so amazing it was so great what you said and I always say well I
didn't really teach you anything I'm just reminding you so I think that we have all of this great
knowledge deep within our DNA of what we know is right on the earth and when people you know hear
about what we're doing the certification there's so many that want to jump on because they're
reminded of something that they know is a better solution than than what's happening now and no
matter what size you know plot you have you can be pure certified you know we we we talk about
having six closed loops and the importance of that and you know so we're certifying all different
size farms from huge massive hemp farms you know to to small backyard plots. And and and there is
a limitation on massive you know hemp farms and stuff but you know when I talk you need to talk
about ten acres you know regeneratively or 20 that's that's pretty big and stuff so that's that's
the way we're what we're thinking there and and so we have you know Edel green farm out in
Switzerland who are certified and there's three farms in Canada that are certified and there's
farms around the US we went to Thailand and we're in communication with farms with some some local
farmers in Thailand and we really do want to expand it into the world and we do travel quite
a bit in the world so we would love to visit an area to really define what it is bioregionally
you know what pure certified would mean or what you know regenerative would mean in a bioregion
and right now we're not certifying a lot of indoor farms what we have is mostly sun-grown
outdoor farms and people with food gardens and so the part of the requirements of what we have
is to have a food garden and to have pollinator and flower gardens aside from your cannabis or
even better mixed in with your cannabis so and it can be done indoors and we are working on
creating a pure certified indoor certification which would end entail you know some type of
alternative energy or some ways that you've lowered your energy use in your grid using LED
lights or some kind of a mixed spectrum so yes I you know we would just like to tell people out in
the world please get in touch with us I mean you know what we're interested in is really earth
stewards uniting and telling our story together it doesn't have to be just cannabis we you know
food farms are out there getting in touch with us to wineries anyone really it's it's kind of a
way of life you know and we we support each other the best we can as family you know to just be
natural and make a difference and and also we find ways we can work together with business.
And it's not it's not an exclusivity thing it's it's absolutely earth stewards unite it's it's
so important if you have these wonderful ideas and there's a way that you can make a change within
your own you know community or your own neighborhood you know do it if something inspires you then we're
just really encouraging people to do it see what happens you know part of the pure certification
that we do all also is that you have to be part of community education in some way so you know go out
and share share your successes share your failures you know talk about what worked and what didn't
work we have we're at this wonderful like bell curve of knowledge in the human race right now
we're able to find knowledge at a single touch of the button and we're sharing knowledge in such an
excited way and I think that you know the more that we are able to align with nature she has
more and more solutions with us and that's really you know the main connection not only are we
connected by this master plant but we're also connected for with our love of nature.
And also I just just add really quickly that our ultimate our best way of taking on new areas is
to find a model farm say in Australia or New Zealand you know a model farm that would have
us you know show up at the farm we could have a gathering where we met you know local farmers and
then what we do is we because our certification is free it's more about you know being able to
complete all of the requirements and and then once we visit you know say that model farm then
we could create a peer-reviewed inspection so once one farm is certified then they go out and
certify other farms and then they can tell from that farm whether it reflects you know the level
of standards and ethics that they have and that's the way that it builds within each region so we
may come for the original one and maybe we try and come back again later you know on other years
but it becomes peer-reviewed and it's we take it really seriously so all farms are having everything
you know every input on the farm is is tested and inspected to human grade quality and art and all
of our products are also you know tested in laboratories so you know we we have to walk
our talk and and create medicine that's you know really valuable to the market. Most certainly so
at the start of that one you mentioned that you had been looking at some stuff in Thailand I
noticed that you've been posting a reasonable amount of content from Bali what's your involvement
with that? We've been going to Bali for a really long time let's see I think maybe about 17 17
years we've been going to Bali and and it started with me at the beginning is that I was Josh and I
were both instrumental and opening up a free clinic for women and in a birthing center so
also for pregnant women as well as postnatal women to be able to come in and receive help to receive
care so that was something that we started and we just kept going back and then when the tsunami
happened we were the first boots on the ground in the Aceh province. We worked with permaculture
NGOs EDEP was one and while he which was friends of the earth and we worked with other world NGOs
to come together to create you know safe place for women and children during chaos so we did a
lot of work in that area and also supported a clinic in Bali as well. So we have a lot of
family it's it's sort of another home for us it's another heart space for us in the world so when we
go there we you know we see a lot of family and friends and I get to be surrounded with a lot of
older children that I got to see you know into the world so it's it's just a it's a route for us.
And we we do custom sarongs and make custom sarongs but we also you know that's a side thing
but we work with permaculture you know we we really like seeing the expansion of permaculture
that's happening on Bali and there's a lot of international people there and just a lot of
really amazing food to table farm to table raw food places and farms that are really beautiful
there so it's been really fun to watch the conscious expansion. Yeah being one of the
countless Australians who's been to Bali myself I can attest that the the food there's great and
the fact that it's grown locally and organically only helps. I guess the question I'm wondering is
what's the local production of cannabis like there because from my extremely extremely limited
experience it was it was hard to find decent quality stuff but that's very much from the
perspective of like you know someone who's not in the loop with any of the locals or anything
what's it like when you're a part of that inner circle? Well in Bali particularly we wouldn't
recommend it at all you know it's a very Indonesia's incredibly strict even though a lot of
the the older Balinese and especially when you go over to Sumatra you know you definitely see a lot
of the locals using cannabis and it's sort of a normalcy for them. Some of the most isolated
cannabis in the world you know that I believe to still be you know true land race is in Sumatra
is in some of the islands in Indonesia because it's been so blocked off but you know if you go
to Bali it's a really good time to take a break it's not a time to ask people on the streets you
know where to find it or where to get it you know people are found with with five grams and they're
spending 17 years in jail as Australians it's not something that you want to be doing and really the
quality that you get is going to be from another island so you know I would just really recommend
to people that that's just not a place where where cannabis mixes with their vacation but of course
you see a lot of these old land races that I was just talking about and that's something that I'm
really interested in you know when I went and worked over in Sumatra for many months I learned a lot
about the relationship that the locals had there with cannabis it's a very tight close relationship
it's something that they used to calm down it was something that they used in their daily life when
they would come into the clinic I would say you know how much do you smoke and they would say well
I smoke you know six of these and they would point to their breast pocket that had the tobacco and
they'd say I'd smoke eight of these a day and that's you know the cannabis pocket so even though
there's it's really incredible sort of strict regiment and laws yeah Sharia law it's really
interesting at J is a CEH which is an acronym for Arabic Chinese European and Hindustani and it's
it's just because C is that sound in Indonesia but that the Ache region is in northern Sumatra
and it's one of the most strict Islamic areas in Indonesia but it's where all the herb is grown so
it's super kind of like and they have guerrilla kind of they had that they you know different
autonomous regions there and and they say that the the weed came from India back in the Dutch
trading days and stuff so I don't you know exactly how long it's been on Sumatra maybe
hundreds of years we don't really know exactly because it is really closed off but it is
interesting how it's in common you know the common person's possession in northern Sumatra you know
in that area and it's a real tall thin leafed variety that has you know uplifting terpenes
you know more like a lemonade and beta-caryophyllene terpene they take an incredibly long time to flower
so they're really reminiscent of of just interesting cannabis that you know is not something
that and it definitely gives you a very different feeling you know we were talking earlier about oh
you know those old land races and what does it make you feel like well you know that really
isolated very far removed and not interbred with a lot of the modern cannabis of today
really gives you a totally different eye than than what the modern cannabis we brought we brought
some seeds back so you know we're trying to give it a try to germinate them it can be a little
difficult but you know what we we are always a little bit of uh you know crafty let's say
yeah things manage to just appear back at home somehow
and Malaysia's laws are changing so we're really hopeful that Indonesia's laws change with that
with Thailand's change the world you know is changing and and I would love nothing more than
to be able to work with hemp or hemp oils in Indonesia because there's crazy sicknesses
happening there and and I'm in love with rice and what's happened with rice is their staple diet is
creating a lot of weird illnesses there so I mean they could really use the medicine and it would be
nice to see some law changes there and it was great this time that we went to Bali there was
more and more people asking us about it and really absolutely you know how I was talking
about earlier of just being reminded that this is a good medicine they would say oh well my
grandmother used that in tea absolutely you know there's no like bad reflection you know on cannabis
or they haven't been through like any kind of a political move they just know that it's illegal
but they don't really get why it's illegal and it's in the village but it's not given out to
the tourists there's a clear distinction and stuff so yeah that's that's what's happening there
yeah kind of backs my limited experience admittedly I was what 14 when I went there so
many moons ago but uh to jump onto something a little more recent it's been well over a year
since we last talked probably should have asked this a little earlier on but
what's new in the world of dragonfly
oh so much I feel like you know one week in the cannabis industry feels like a year
so there's so much that's happening right now you know we just wanted to be humble cannabis farmers
and producing beautiful medicine for sick people and now all of a sudden we're learning about
genetic coding and patenting and markering and corporate takeovers and and creating a business
and how you have to you know learn the rules so you know how to break them and it's just and federal
licensure and how to do it without a consultant and you know still having our products and still
growing a whole new garden and every year but mostly exciting the most exciting thing we think
is just this the collective of farmers and businesses that we're working with and the
science of regenerative cannabis tour that we've been doing is really amazing and just the expansion
of knowledge of organic and regenerative practices and we've recently formed an online communication
hub where we can all communicate with each other live and it's really really excellent because
there's you know you know 75 people on there that are very you know active and we all can
communicate with each other and and it's just really really helpful. And I think like as much
of the heavy feeling of licensure and the man coming down on you and heavy duty fines and all
that sort of stuff or you know people having to close up their farms because they can't make you
know they're in economic struggles you know as much as all of that is really difficult and that
is happening is as equal of what is fabulous and fantastic that's happening right now. I mean
we are so totally sparked on by people you know this is a perfect example we we got back from
Indonesia we had been on a flight for I don't even know it felt like 36 hours Josh and I hadn't slept
we spent two hours and in Vancouver and like it's great in Vancouver so we're able to like smoke
some bowls right there in the airport just right outside of the airport and then we flew on to
Michigan and it was dark and it was snowing and we had just come from Indonesia we're like what
in the heck are we doing here this is totally crazy and then not even five hours later we walked
into a room of people at the conference of the science of regenerative cannabis conference and
it only took one second to realize why we do this like as much as it seemed like whoa that was a
really crazy journey like the energy in that room of people that just want to connect over this plant
and want to connect over nature and want to connect over like learning about microbiology
and how to better their life and how to get off their pharmaceuticals because it's all in relation
you know we really have this understanding that if you have healthy soil then you have healthy life
and it's like all of that is happening too so it's this really beautiful yin and yang right now and
I feel like they're equally as potent and it's and and and that's why I say you know one week
in the cannabis industry is a year because so much is happening within that one week that
you know you really want to like hold on to it and soak it up because it's just all so potent
and the farm bill passed and the hemp is a you know a really big frontier and feminization of
seeds and you know there's a there's a lot that we've been we've been talking about so that can
spark you know more conversation. So you guys brought up the science and regenerative cannabis
conferences how has that been and what types of things can we expect to see kind of springing
forth as a result of those conferences? Well what's really beautiful about the conferences is that it
is really rooted in science and it does go through and give you really nuts and bolts
information from really good presenters but it's almost been become like a spiritual thing too
because I mean farmers have to band together right now and and not only is it exciting to create a
natural system and get you know good product it's also kind of a beautiful networking opportunity
for people to come together so you know we did it internationally this year for the first time
in Vancouver and farms are just becoming you know they're just branding themselves here in Canada
and British Columbia this year so they haven't been able to you know say you know I'm a farm until
you know now so there's it's now almost new here. Humboldt I know was it was really really amazing
and farmers are really really coming together and showing up in numbers and just really seed
swapping and sharing seeds with each other it's really just an open public domain of knowledge
sharing and it's not just a presentation you know we're staying in the parking lot in between
we're eating together we're staying around at night and so we're really really connecting
with the crowd and going to areas where they really haven't had conferences like Maine and
Michigan. And a lot of people you know were saying that you know I came here to learn about science
of soil and cannabis and I left with 120 brand new amazing friends that I know that I can call
within a minute so it's like what these are giving us is inspiration like there's so many crazy
things going on in the world and you turn on your tv and if you get sucked into those doldrums of
whatever that is it's like we need to get out of that we need to just look at each other in the
faces and talk about things that inspire us and it's so amazing to be in a room with all of that
those people that are that inspired by nature that really want to make a change in their own
lives and we really you know recommend that you know you asked earlier what can people do they
really want to do something what we recommend is start with yourself it starts with self-love and
it starts with wanting to make changes within your own body and then that ripples out and when you
have all of those wonderful feelings about yourself and the health and well-being within your own body
then it's really easy to educate it's really easy to get the word out because you're really
walking you know your talk and you know there's there's like we said there's science presentations
and then we will have our pure certified farmers panels in the evening where you can do question
and answer and it gives each farm an opportunity to say what they do on their farm that you know
maybe has taken some of the practices that are being taught and shown people how they've put it
into action so it's really useful for people that are attending the conference to hear you know from
five different farms that are you know publicly you know creating medicine and putting themselves
out there to say hey this is how I've taken these systems and put them into action and that's been
really useful the question and answer and and the genetics talks and you know there's a lot with
genetics right now so there's been a lot of a lot of talk about that. A bit of a left of field
question but do you find that the people who attend these conventions or in general just people
are part of say the pure family tend to gravitate towards certain types of genetics or do you think
it's rather a diverse spectrum? Diverse? Yeah I think it's diverse but there's more and more topics
of full spectrum cannabinoid profiles and full spectrum terpene profiles and the importance of
that in really bringing forth the medicine so that you know we can hold a good voice for the plant
so it seems to me like you know more and more people are gravitating to that but of course the
old strains are out there and people are I mean you know there's a there's a there's a good amount
of us that are keeping land race alive there's a good amount of us that are really keeping hash
strains and and searching for the best hash strains you know this is a big part of it hemp
is a big part of it and a breeding project for hemp is is a really a big part of it. You know
I wouldn't say that everyone loves you know gas or fruit or flora it really is it's something for
everyone I think that's that's what's awesome about it it's it's never it's always different.
Of course so part of strain selection for any farmer is considering the types of pests you have
to deal with in your area or within your grow environment. I remember at the Emerald Cup last
year I asked a question that was essentially around the lines of what happens to the predator
bug excretions like is that a problem in itself and our colleague on the panel Ron gave a fantastic
answer but I also remember having a look over and seeing this huge grin on Kelly's face when I asked
that I would love to know what's your opinion on this what happens to the bug poop?
You know there's an incredible web of microbiology and you know if you're even
somebody that wants to order predators out there in the world you already probably are not spraying
crap on your plants and you're and you have if you look under a microscope you would see a tremendous
amount of microbiology and there's cyanobacteria that's on the leaf structure of the plant and when
you have a really healthy plant you've got a huge diversity of different cyanobacteria different
types of fungi on there so a lot of the times if there is predator poop it is actually being
digested by what's already on the plant you know the microbiology it feeds the plant you know the
more you know natural excretions that happen in the plant and the more that we mimic nature which
when you're mimicking nature you're going to have an incredible diversity of both microbiology and
macrobiology on your plants and if you allow you know that nature and that full you know potential
you know of of what is possible within nature then the plant is really absorbing that and it
becomes an incredible nutrient for the plant so that's probably why I was smiling I was thinking
oh that's probably just good food for the plant and depending on what state you're in and and what
your your requirements are for passing tests I mean you know you have to be extremely careful
nowadays with what happens with your flowers and whatnot and stuff and and and there's there's
pathogen tests and aspergillus as you know things that have been brought up that may maybe have been
associated with predators and stuff so you know you it's it's it's the system that's been created
to grow cannabis and is almost impossible so I think it's amazing that people are doing as well
as as they're doing and and honestly like in life you kind of need to be able to to eat like
microscopic insect poop or smoke it even that's that's what I think but just to survive you know
of course of course it's going to create an immune response within the plant and within your own body
as well which is just incredibly important we're suppressing our immune response with all of these
outside sources of just like sterilize sterilize antibiotics kill the microbiology and the more
that we learn we're realizing that microbiology is what's clean so you know worried about a little
bit of poop that's from a predator you know might it's definitely something to look at if you're
doing really strict regimen of testing but as far as a home grower or somebody that you know is is
just making medicine for other people and for themselves and sharing it I mean that's awesome
and and also you know you probably don't want to get your predators really late in your flower
cycle it would be a really good idea to allow them to you know eat eat all of the pathogens on their
you know several weeks before harvest yeah fantastic and I think you know I don't ask
that as though I feel like it's a major problem I ask it because it's it's the commonly used line
people who are whether overtly or kind of more subconsciously are critical of predator bugs
and maybe organics in general that's what they use to try to kind of discredit it and
I think it's an interesting point but maybe not as valid as maybe a other one they could come up
with but I digress something we also spoke about last year though was how big of an issue aphids
were how do you guys advocate to combat it you know it's it's an ever-changing problem what's
your solution to aphids or just in general bugs outdoors polyculture absolutely there's a
wonderful example you can go into Williams into southern Oregon and we have a whole lot of pure
farms there and a lot of friends that have farms in that area it's definitely like a cannabis mecca
in the world so when you go into Williams area you're seeing you know cannabis farms pretty much
almost every single property there's the rare property that's not growing cannabis
and they got hit really hard with aphids this year aphids is absolutely the new pathogen that
everybody needs to prepare for and we know of one farm and that's Casey over at rising phoenix
phoenix rising farms and he did an overabundance of pollinator like garden like you wouldn't
believe flowers just everywhere he is a gorgeous farm and he did flowers everywhere and he didn't
have one single aphid at all because wasps eat like triple their weight in aphids in a day so
and same with you know all these different types of bugs out there as well as bees and
I mean and as well as birds so that's just a perfect example and maybe you have a nursery
in a greenhouse and you can do a heat treatment at 120 degrees for 50 degrees centigrade you know
two hours or whatnot and and maybe three and you just monitor it make sure the plants are doing
good but you can heat treat a nursery pretty easily and that's a really clean easy way to
deal with it also you know a good spray with water early on can can can get them but you know
that's another thing and and some people have had success after heat treatments with with like a
good lace wing oh yeah we've had the the best experience when when when it first came out I
noticed it right away I said whoa this is not a normal aphid I don't care what anybody says this
is we're not dealing with a normal aphid so I put it into jars I fed it all these different things I
was watching how many it was reproducing or cloning itself I was feeding it all different
types of foods you know even brassicas and it was running from the brassicas like what aphid runs
from a brassica like even survive off of brassicas you know it's their number one food source and
this one was so different and it has like these little hooks on its chest that other aphids don't
have so I knew that we were like up against something really interesting and the way that it
was you know propagating itself was like quadruple the rate at that time and so we're really watching
this and I think Josh and I you know we put this out on Instagram right away and many several years
ago and people were like what is that those look like normal aphids you know and what we noticed
is I sprayed probably 25 different oils on it and all different homemade things and things that I
could and finally we just came to what would happen if we mess with the bacterium which is
inside of the aphid which has to be some kind of have have some kind of a heat issue going on
and that bacterium is what helps it propagate and what clones itself so if you mess with that
bacteria which is inside of the aphid bringing the temperature up high then it sterilizes it
and we realized that really soon on so we started doing tests and how many hours and how high did
the temperatures need to get and were they harming any of our pollinators or or was it harming some
of the other important you know insects that we had within the greenhouse and we really came to
that 120 degrees for two to three hours and your pollinators just thrive in that heat the plants
thrive in that heat as long as they're damp and they're not in small pots you cannot be heating
up the roots to that but the plants really thrive in that and the aphids are completely sterilized
and then within a very short period of time all of your insects that like to eat the aphids will
come in within a couple of days and just pick them off because they're not propagating and
recolonizing themselves so heat treatment I think above and beyond anything else it's absolutely
the way to go and also pollinators if they're outside because they are in our natural environment
I don't know where they came from they came like an incredible vengeance I would you know venture
to say that somebody made them up as an evil plan but you know I can't you know put my finger on that
by any means but it just the way that it came into our community and they weren't just being passed
by clones because we don't use clones we we only started with seeds and all of a sudden they were
here so I think that pollinators if you're outdoors and heat treatment for greenhouses and indoors
some really solid suggestions there I remember that another major point that I took away from
that discussion was that the use of essential oils was potentially a lot more problematic than
people are aware would you be able to go into a little more depth for our audience who maybe
haven't been able to hear that discussion well I mean for me I don't I don't really like to be
covered in oil you know I don't know about you but sort of that thick oily feeling all over your body
is really no different than what the plant feels and when you're spraying heavy oils or any kind
of volatile essential oils or even like a coconut oil then that's going to immediately change the
microbiome on your leaf surface and when you change the microbiome of your leaf surface then
you're allowing in other problems and I always look at what you do to your garden should be
you don't look at the first ripple you know like if you drop a stone into water and I know I've
said this before but if you drop a stone into water it's not the first ripple you need to look
at the very last ripple so if you spray your plants with essential oils for pests are you going to be
bringing in more pathogenic leaf mildew you know or what other factors or stressors are the plant
yeah light sensitivity or what other stressors are the plant going to have so it's really not
a solution and it's definitely and it's and it's more of an allopathic look at it rather than a
real holistic look which we really encourage people to look at their gardens more holistically
so then we can have a better understanding of looking at our own health more holistically
because cannabis has an incredible lesson to teach us all which is you know what she thrives best in
is is what we also thrive best in yeah of course of course so what do you think of the emerald cup
in general we've had a little discussion about our talks thus far but the overall consensus I've
had from a variety of guests on the show is that the kind of overall vibe and more specifically
the energy that's normally in the air just wasn't quite there last year how do you feel about that
one well first of all we really really love the emerald cup and um you know we didn't know that
was going on because we were in our teepee it's awesome in our teepees well i mean in all fairness
i guess it's the laws that have changed you know so the laws in california have dictated the way
the event can run so i mean it's not like you know tim and taylor came out and said oh you know we're
gonna or hazel whatever we're gonna we're gonna run this you know like this you know you know
they're they're trying to do the most heartfelt amazing you know show that they can do you know
with the laws that they've been given and and if you want to get get upset at something get you know
get upset at the state of california and and the way that they've created you know distribution
you know for farmers and so because now you know you're not going to get as many farmers as you did
before because they're probably through some kind of distribution company and maybe the distribution
company is awesome or maybe they're not but um yeah you know that the tents were different than
they were before and and you could you know to get directly to a farmer was different but
there was as many panels as there always was and you know for us the emerald cup is a really great
experience because we have two teepees and we have our cocoa going and we have all of the farmers
that we're working with um around the whole time and we're we're giving you know where we have seed
exchange happening and um you know we're able to you know consume and just really enjoy each other
and really talk a lot of stories so i mean we have like you know epic times at the emerald cup and
and i would say you know times have changed and that that's what's hard but at the emerald cup
it's still a gathering of you know some of the most amazing farmers in california and there's
really not another event that's you know better than it at all and so you know we're really stoked
about what they've done and we're proud to be part of it and i can feel you know where those
people are coming from too and i think you know josh really hit the nail on the head is that
what people are feeling is the new regulations what people are feeling is you know not that
same direct voice from the farmer not the same type of diversity they're feeling that you know
three years ago a tremendous amount of farms that were there no longer in business because
they couldn't stay in business because the exorbitant licensing fees or timing or you know
people who have applied for licenses and it's just sitting in an office you know for years
i mean it goes it goes on and on and on the incredible regulations that farmers and breeders
and extractors and product makers are under is so significant that it absolutely doesn't
surprise me that people felt that energy at the emerald cup yeah so i think the general consensus
we have within the community in the moment is that there is a lot of elements of disunity and i guess
distrust more specifically for the way legal changes and the way bigger companies are acting
on them how do you see us going forward and what's the best way to kind of get everyone on
the same page in terms of morals and ethics drop the competition we are not in competition with
each other these outside big entities are coming in and they're instilling a fear within people
that they need to be competitive we are not competitive we are not in competition we are
the opposition we are not in opposition we are just an alternative we need to join together
and be really happy for other farmers successes that are doing wonderful we need to be happy for
you know passing out your your genetics and somebody else did a better job than what you
did like that's freaking rad we need to be happy for each other because this sort of like fear
based competitive thing is coming into play and i really think that if we can drop that
that's just the answer and realize you know that we are really a commodity and that you know the
large corporations are wanting to capitalize on our intentions and on our ethics and then
if farmers are not mindful they could potentially join forces with you know corporations and then
in the end the corporation just acts like a corporation doesn't they just sell potentially
sell you off or sell off your whole your your face or what you've created your marketing what
all that and then so you know this is a time where we're just trying to say hey you know what let's
just not be exclusive with any one person let's just keep your autonomy let's create independence
and autonomy and autonomy let's create products maybe they're together maybe they're within each
farm and create a network so right now it's just don't get eaten by a corporation that's that's
basically the model you wake up in the morning you're okay okay how am i not going to get eaten
by a corporation and don't think that you know you've got one contract that's in front of you
that that's going to be the last one that you're ever going to see and we really want to see more
pro tracks rather than contracts so we really don't sign any contracts no contracts contrary
to your well well-being you know and and independence and realizing that you can work
together with other farms and say hey you know what's hot what do you guys got going on and
the more that you share and we talk to each other then we're creating a much larger commodity like
josh said i mean we are the commodity for the first time you know this year we started realizing
how many thousands and thousands of pounds that the pure collective already produces per year
whereas these huge corporations are just talking about you know what they're going to do in 2021
we are already doing it the only way that these corporations are going to get the
keys to our castle is if we give them to them so keep the keys to your castle share them with your
friends who are going to be respectful and ethical in the same way that you are a co-op
for sure so you guys put out your perspective on the whole phylos debacle a few weeks back
and to me it was you know beautiful kind of statement of authenticity and kind of reinterrating
what we need to do to move forward but there wasn't a lot of views expressed on specifically
how you see the phylos situation and what they're doing do you feel like we're at a point now where
it's almost very problematic to incorporate any sort of genomic testing within our kind of garden
or our cultivars well i mean you know for sure we were totally against what happened with phylos
and what happened there you know that would just seem like something that you know it really brought
up the conversation is as farmers where do where do we stand you know what how do we work together
and we look to like our food systems and we look and we're looking to what's happened with like
food i mean you know this this has happened before so we're you know we're looking into
open public domain and and breeding and you know i do genomic sequencing comes from you know
large corporate machines and so you know you'd have to be really skeptical to use that information
i think that someone else isn't going to use it and maybe they have better technology to use it
than you do i mean personally i just want to give a big shout out and a thank you to phylos
what an incredible opportunity that we were all given to look at the dark side and to realize
we better get our shit together and we need to start creating this powerful entity you know
within ourselves and how is it that we can pull together and since that time has happened i mean
the education that josh and i have have searched out you know we've gone to mentors we've been
talking to people that are way smarter than we are and who have had way more experience than we have
on this and how do they feel about you know public domain and open source and and markering and
patenting and what i keep coming to as far as the cannabis plant she's an adaptogen cool patent away
because great you're going to patent a seed and then i'm going to take that seed and i'm going
to put it into my deep red rich beautiful garden beds and it's not going to look like your seed
that you just patented so you know we need to give credit to the cannabis plant as well she
is not just soybean she isn't tobacco she isn't corn she's not going to be that easily controlled
you know in that way and i think that we need to focus more on being the best what is the best
genetic that we're going to put out this year so you can go ahead and you can you can patent your
your 2017 strain but let's talk about what you're doing in 2020 we need to be pushing ourselves to
be better and to create better strains not be looking at the past of what was because she's
constantly changing and you know when you say open source and and um you know genetics like
that's exactly what it is so if you put every all of your information out in the public you know
that anyone can use it so you you'd have to be you know really skeptical about or or decide whether
you care or not i mean because maybe at one point you're just like well you know i'm in evolution
right now like kelly said you know what i'm in the middle of right now is making something new
and making something new i mean none of us really necessarily keep the exact same strain forever
and if and if ganja could have been could have been patented and controlled i think they would
have done it back in the 30s when they got rid of it so that they could chemically fertilize
cotton and other wheat and stuff i think i think i think that the the cannabis plant would have been
genetically modified then and controlled then but i don't think it actually can so i think maybe on
one level we may not actually have to worry you know about about that but we are also not joining
that and don't condone that at all either yeah and i and i don't feel really bad that people are
spending millions and millions of dollars to try to figure out how to patent and marker this plant
like go ahead do it i i'm really having all of my bets that the cannabis plant will have the last
laugh and we'll just take all of their money so you know that's that's sort of what we go on but
also this phyllis thing has given us now you know like i was saying we we went to corvallis we sat
down with alan capular for many hours and any of you who don't know who alan capular is aka mushroom
please go online learn about him he's an incredibly intelligent geneticist he understands what
markering and and genetically modifying is because he did that in his earlier years of life and and
what we came to is you know since all of that has happened we are now which we were already
planning on doing but it's with much more intention is we're doing a pure certified
breeding project right now so that we can get seeds from a particular farmer and we can pass
it out to 50 different farms we can take a little bit of data between ourselves that is public
domain that seed that varietal becomes actualized yeah and that's really important because there's
40 other farms that have done it so we really say bring it into the public domain if you want to
you know have a seed or or a varietal that is yours that you would like to keep as yours you're
gonna have to give it out to a whole lot of people so that that becomes actualized so that nobody else
can take that from you and we feel like that's much more powerful than paying a whole bunch of
money to patent something that can be changed anyway so how do you feel about genomic testing
in general do you feel like it's almost inevitable that ultimately the data set will be sold off or
do you feel like there is a way to get this information while feeling safe about the results
and not falling into the hands of say big ag well guaranteed it's going to be sold off
so to think that you're joining something and it's not going to be sold off is just
it's just not true i mean it's it's already been sold off everywhere it's but with food and
everything so i think that human beings sell out yeah i mean corporations are meant to sell out
it's like being angry with a cougar that kills a bunny rabbit you know like it's the nature of big
corporations big corporations are going to come in and they're going to crush and the only way that
we can prevent that is by joining forces with each other like i was saying before so maybe you
use it and you and you you know take what you want out of it and maybe you've you've created a
protract that works for you with your with your uh with genomic sequencing company there are
companies out there that might anonymize your information and and you know you you might find
a company that you you can trust you know for us you know and there's universities you know that
you might trust to um to to work with but you know to think that big ag is not you know out there
that's what it's what big ag does you know it's what they do with genetics and stuff i think our
our value i think we should just not worry about it and just make our value the way that we grow
and the the diversity of genetics rather than worrying about one strain and i think that it's
really interesting it brings up sort of this this term ownership into the world like the ownership
of a certain strain that you've been working with 10 years but the human beings were working with
it 10 000 years before that so it's like what's ownership what what is it that we own and it's
like we feel like oh geez well we have to own it before they own it and i think that you know is
is sort of this this fear and that's where it's sort of that that the competition thing that i was
talking about like why is it that humans feel like we need to own something especially a seed like
i can't even believe that that's legal but of course i can because legal is based in corporations
and corporations are here to crush so i i love what the dalai lama says learn the rules so you
know how to break them and we can look at the incredible failures that genomic sequencing and
gmos and yeah and even hybridization has given us like oh yay so now we have 17 different varieties
of 2 000 different potatoes that we could be eating on the planet but there's only 17 like
i'm just making up those numbers but it's like we're is there something about humans that likes
to set up a system that we can't even work within and i think that if we just sort of take a step
back and realize what wasn't working within genomic sequencing is we'll realize like why do we
want to do that what it it just doesn't make any sense because then it starts to have ownership
and like i said before i i love my varietals and josh and i work really hard on our strings but
we got those from somebody else 20 years ago and it's kind of like the you know they give it away
you know adage or maybe it's a grateful dead vibes you know you could the the tapes were
not you could never sell them you had to give them away and it only made everything better i mean
when we gave our we give our seeds away to say nick and liz at green source gardens and they
come out with something that they like like they love the zellies gift and they're like oh my god
i'm gonna you know put that into some of my genetics i mean to me i'm like oh that's that's
awesome you saw something in our genetics that we're working with the oh yeah go for it you know
make whatever you want out of it you know have a have an awesome time i can't wait to see the plans
um you know so we why would we have seed exchanges and seed swaps all the time everywhere we go every
single event that we do if we were worried about patenting or owning anything i think we just it's
so diverse just fall in love with the diversity and just not worry about it that's that's kind of
what we feel right now we've always given our genetics away we're not going to patent them
and it is and i get it too it is really weird that this you know guy is coming in with a three-piece
suit on he's never even smoked cannabis but he wants to rule the cannabis world i get it it it
is very strange you know we had this tight-knit beautiful cannabis community for you know is my
entire adult life so this is like a whole new trend transition that i'm i'm sitting at the
table with these people that are talking about cannabis and i'm like i know you've never even
smoked it before so it's it's a really interesting dichotomy and i think that it comes back to what
i was saying before you know if if we don't want the castle to be given away then don't give away
the keys you know keep your genetics tight within the people that you love and see what they can do
with it and be happy that they're creating something awesome and be really grateful that
your own genetics came from somebody else that worked on them for a really long time and be
grateful to them rather than feeling like you've got some sort of an ownership over it so like
josh and i are worried about the licensed producer stealing our genetics and doing better than we can
with it it's not going to happen like go for it but you're just going to steal the genetic and put
it into like a stupid system and it's not going to come and she's not going to perform for you
so it's just kind of like uh you know and uh you know anyway so we we we loved the idea of
open source we love the idea of being able to see the genetics and being able to see the connections
that was the coolest thing about the idea of the galaxy or something like that during the time was
to be able to say hey this is connected to all this lineage and i mean that that would be really
interesting for us in genetics but i think we're moving into a time that we're almost
moving away from strains on some levels and we're just looking at plants more like chemovars and
and and what their chemical compounds or their terpene terpenes are and stuff and so i don't
know there's a lot of ways to work with the cannabis once it's grown now okay good answer
good answer so something i wanted to ask which is kind of related but not really about genomic
mapping type of thing i've seen a few people post more and more frequently about how sap analysis
from leaves can be used as like a nutrient profiling technique how do you feel about that
as kind of the basis for the evaluation of a nutrient program or kind of some new things
you're implementing within your own cultivars well anytime that you can learn more about the
plant that's all really exciting and adding a sense yeah and sap analysis has been happening
with with all different types of plants you know within agriculture uh for a long time and now
people are just starting to talk about it with cannabis and it's just another way to look at
you know how well your plant is uptaking different minerals and different nutrients and that's really
going to still come down to the microbiology and and what's present and everything in your soil
as well as leaves but there's also an incredible you know intuitive value of being able to look at
a plant and be able to get a feeling for it and say yeah you're healthy and you just know that
it's healthy and i think that you know what i would suggest to people that are listening to
this is create a better relationship with with your plants in your house with your cannabis plants
with your garden plants with the plants that are around your property because that's going to give
you a better you know communication and a better relationship with plants and i and i think that
we have this deep connection with plants as human beings on the earth because we eat them we
cultivate them we can't really live without them they create our oxygen the symbiosis is so deep
that i feel like that's a really beautiful thing to be able to see the health and well-being of
your plants is just being in tune with that dna connection that we have with plants on the earth
and i think a sap analysis you know is going to tell you you know whether you have enough
you know trace minerals or whether it's you know a strong reading or a high number or not but it's
not going to tell you oh you need more magnesium you know it's not going to be like oh you're you're
you're you're high on boron or something like that so i mean there is this going to take a level of
intuition i think that the that it's extremely crucial maybe to use the sap analysis as we
know part of your analysis you know and then and then you also have a soil analysis that you have
and a bridge and able to you know what and and and with soil tests and soil analysis you are able to
test you know your organic matter counts in your microbiology and that's and i think at the end of
the day you're just gonna you're gonna recognize oh well this soil is really rich enough you know
when you have a really live living rich soil like on our land right now our greenhouses and all of
our land is like i'm feeling super good right now about the plants getting into the soil right now
and just taking off so and even even when you test a soil and you could test the soil and then you
it could say oh well it's got these certain amount of minerals but you still don't know what the plant
is uptaking or what the plant is not uptaking so you know diversity in your soil is so important
for the ultimate health of the plant because then it gives the plant the ability to uptake what it
needs as it needs and so i mean soil analysis after every flower cycle is really helpful if
you're doing indoors you know and outdoors maybe once at the end of the year or something unless
you're light dapping and then you know you could test it but i think what we've just come to is just
add more raw materials create more biology and just make it just a crazy worm farm
a crazy worm farm i like that analogy that's pretty much what it is that's good that's good so
we see the claim that there's a lot of the hydroponically or synthetically produced what
people would refer to as cali bud most notably strains like cookies and gelatos it'll often be
kind of commented that oh those are full of pgrs just look at the way they look you know you can
tell and likewise we don't see people like the cookie fam or people who produce these cultivars
really talking much about the nutrients they use do you feel like if someone doesn't want to disclose
something as seemingly simple as their nutrient regime it's not too far-fetched to assume that
maybe something more than what meets the eyes going on behind the scenes yeah i mean you know
my guess is that they're surviving every single round that they're getting through and you know
they're just stoked they have weed at the end of the run you know and plus you know it's with
cookies and different varieties like that you know it's they're hard to grow so you know it's
it can be it's a finicky plant it doesn't have like the big you know harvest and the big you
know buds or whatever like that so um you know i mean i think if you have to question it don't
smoke it don't buy it it's it's that simple yeah you know if you have to question it and you don't
know what people's growing practices are because they're not out there in the open and they're
being secretive and private about their growing practices i mean that's not ip people try to say
oh my growing regimen is ip that's sort of silly okay intellectual property and what you're feeding
your soil all right to me that's a big red flag just people that are more you know upstanding
um about what it is that they're doing and what they're adding is the people that you want to
support yeah of course of course so how do you i mean you kind of touched on the point right there
but how do you feel about organic companies that like maybe produce a nutrients or a soil
and again they won't release specific information about maybe the ingredients they use and yeah they
say it's ip or it's proprietary do you feel like that's you know even if it's quite an organic
product it's just it still needs to be viewed with suspicion well i mean i can only say what
we've done and if you look at any of our products it has every single ingredient in it and it has
the exact ratio so what we say to people is everything that we put out is something that
is good for the world and if if you want to learn from it and you know you want to copy it i know
that's not what we're necessarily talking about but go ahead like for us to be able to be forthright
is just really important because i just i just think that it's important to share information
and if people are not sharing then of course you got to wonder like what kind of skeletons do they
have in their closet and and then people will say well you know people can grow and make your product
and go and do it themselves and we're like you know more power to them that's that's awesome
has it hurt our business absolutely not um people want to buy our products because it says exactly
what's on there it's no different than if you go to a grocery store it's a beautiful i want to know
i want to know what ingredients every single ingredient in the food i'm eating it's no
different than in what i'm smoking so what i'm putting in my soil is what i'm smoking so of
course i want to know every single ingredient yeah it's it's pretty obvious so do you favor
a fungal or a bacterial dominant soil during a specific stage of the life cycle because we hear
things like having say a fungal dominant soil is good for boosting the plant's immune system
maybe for things like terpene production which are often thought of as a secondary metabolite
or a secondary function of the immune system whereas say a bacterial dominant soil might be
more advantageous to promoting growth during vegetative or the early flower stages do you
agree with these ideas or do you just kind of let the plant do it at once well we let the plant do
it at once and but we also so but having said that i would say that we would we would go you can't just
change your soil from bacterial to fungal dominant you know based off your cycle your
plant so you kind of have to choose like you know a soil that you feel is is really live and rich and
a fungal dominant soil is really really important for nutrient breakdown and metabolization so
we would want a nutrient a fungal dominant soil and maybe for the vegetative we would use
some of our fermented plant juice or some kind of high bacterial plant juice
teas to be able to get some of that nitrogen or growth hormones in in the vegetative cycle so we
would that's how we would do it and fungi and bacteria they work together you know it's so
important to have both of them in the soil at a lot of different diversity and a large amount you
know you want to have lots of colonization of both and just like within our body if we were to
check our own microbiome it changes from day to day it changes with whether it's a cool day and
then you've got like lots of bacteria that wants to come right up onto the surface of the soil or
whether it's super hot and they go really deep well the plant's uptake is going to change from
day to day as well and when you've got like an indoor situation what we've been learning more
and more is that you have what we were going into gardens you know many years ago and doing
consultations and taking a lot of microbiology a look at the microbiology that was happening within
the soil as well as nutrient and and what was going on with the mineral ratios and all of that
and we were realizing that in cannabis indoor gardens there's a tremendous amount of
bacteria and people were really trying to grow these plants that were super bacteria rich when
you have soils that are super bacterial rich then you have such a greater chance of any type of a
pathogen coming in and taking that over because fungi is so incredibly voracious and it's it's
very strong so if there it becomes like a garter and if there's a pathogen that's going on the soil
or you've got fusarium or pythium or any type of a root rot like that you know your fungi is the one
that's going to be you know right there at the beginning so fungi is so incredibly important to
have within your soil at all times as well as bacteria feeding your plant foods so you know
there was that thought that fungi is the only thing that can break down phosphorus and yes
that's totally true so then people started saying well now you want to have a really fungi rich
you know environment more in flowering because it's going to be breaking down the phosphorus
and that is true and also plants are still going to decide from day to day and and colonization
is going to ebb and flow within that soil so adding a lot of different types of food in your
soil that's going to feed your beneficial fungi and your beneficial bacteria is is really ideal
higher amounts of organic matter yep yeah of course so this is a kind of a zoomed out question
but i've been thinking about this one a lot how do we go about raising the value be it perceived
or just simply in the marketplace how do we go about raising the value of sun-grown cannabis
in the mind of consumers is that the end goal to get it on par with indoor or is it simply a case
of out produce them well i think it's partly it's create good sun-grown flower you know i mean show
where it can shine so to speak with it with its sun and you know and just helping people realize
the ecological impact i think a lot of people when they go to stores or dispensaries or they
look online and they're buying i think they if they've come across a co-op of farms or
a farm itself and they have the opportunity to buy from a farm that's doing something that's
agile ecologically sound and positive that i believe that that does add the value
adds value and we've seen that with farms and we've seen that with dispensaries that
like soulful and california is a really good um you know uh example of a place that's really shown
you know let's say californians what good sun grown looks like and the farms that grow it you
know and there's there's farms that they work with and they and the farmers go into the place
and they talk about their product and they meet the farmers so um and when regenerative farmers
all join together then we can actually set the value of what super high quality flower looks like
and you know i think it's important to hear that you know we really appreciate all of the indoor
you know growers out there that don't have an option to be outdoors you know thank goodness
for you for supporting you know sick people and supporting patients and supporting your friends
to not be drinking or taking hard drugs you know showing them the way with cannabis we think that
you know indoor has really helped bring the plant forward you know she's been the one that's been
incredibly persecuted and if we can hold these strains and still have these indoor gardens well
we're activists and still having a voice for that plant so you know we're not i think that there's
an incredible value in indoor especially when you're just still respecting the plant so i don't
know if the conversation is so much about indoor outdoor i think it's about like respectful way
that the plant is grown conscious cultivation you know i mean what's what what's valuable about sun
grown is that it's positively impacting the earth as we've talked about numerous times already
tonight and that's and that's a real why that's important and then if you're looking at an you
know cannabis as an industry you know you you it's it is a plant that that is naturally grown
under the sun and so to to be able to support farms that do that you know is really valuable
and we've really seen you know farms have more value with their plants so you know it's you kind
of have to be you have to be a jack-of-all-trades you have to be a farmer and you have to be able
to really share your story in a way that's enticing and and really helpful to um consumers
and it's really important to us that these people who are cultivating this plant and have a tight
relationship with this plant have a future with this plant it's so important that the cannabis
community and the cannabis culture continues forward that corporate you know takeover doesn't
completely happen and we believe that that's going to happen by people producing the the least amount
of you know cost per gram for them to be able to stay in this industry and for them to be able to
continue their cultivation so that's another reason why we really encourage people to do
sun grown to do outdoor light depth to use the sun because it's so much less expensive and it
is really being able to offer that alternative to the corporate cannabis we need to stay in business
and a good way to stay in business is to save a lot of money. Yeah of course on that same topic of
sun grown cannabis what types of companion plants do you recommend to use in conjunction with
cannabis farming because recently I've seen some posts that criticize clover which is often held
to be a really good companion plant and some people are saying oh you know it just robs the
soil of nitrogen it's not really that good what things do you recommend to go alongside your
canna cutting? Well clover is an indication you know it can be an indication it can be a
communicator that tells you whether you have bugs or not so I wouldn't say that it's you know
creating the problem at all and part of using clover as a cover crop is to understand
how to use it you know you wouldn't want to let it grow too long to get super infected you would
want to you know kind of work it into the top layer of your soil and if you keep it you know
young and vibrant you know it's way less likely to have any pathogens on it so learning how to
use your cover crop is really important and some you know buckwheat is a really good companion
plant sorghum Sudanese sorghum grasses is a cover crop and a companion plant that you can
use that colonizes mycorrhizal fungi so it can help build the colonies of grass and of mycorrhizal
fungi. And also cover crop what's around you know see what's thriving in your zone and area if you're
in an outdoor farm you know see what's thriving in your zone and area for us everybody we just
showed a bunch of pictures on our Instagram of our plants that are coming up and people said oh
you know what kind of cover crops did you plant and there's a ton of them in there but we didn't
actually plant any yet it's just what's coming up in the native soil so that's another really huge
benefit on utilizing closed loop methods that you can just see what wants to come up and what wants
to thrive but for indoor scenarios or people that just have like you know maybe a small garden that
isn't that connected to nature we really love to rotate our cover crops and start out with sort of
a nitrogen rich one that breaks down really easily like chickweed at the beginning and then it can
move more into quinoa is a wonderful one buckwheat is another great one and then you can start moving
into more like phosphorus rich and potassium rich ones you could do a corn if you wanted to if you
grow your own corn but whatever you're free is one that people use a lot but it's one that gets
powdery mildew if it gets if it stays alive a long time so you almost kind of have to keep that
cut down and really fresh too and that's another thing is that you were talking about clover it's
sort of getting a bad rap well it gets a bad rap because people are leaving it too long maybe
and then you know more things will colonize on it so we really love to pull up our cover crop and
lay down a new one continuously we know that i mean pretty soon it's going to be exciting we're
going to be able to have hemp as a cover crop because you know we're producing so much hemp
seed that we're going to be able to you know have that also and see what that's like so we're just
continuously trying new things you know you can use lemon balms and holy basils and in different
things you know that around in your gardens and not as a cover crop because then it would go
crazy but yeah i mean you know nettles grow all around but that's not necessarily the best cover
crop either but we kind of have it as a cover crop in our area poppy is a really amazing cover crop
you can grow poppy flowers and it create and it contains the highest amount of phosphorus
in a plant varietal that we know of so if you take a whole bunch of poppy seed and it only takes a
few poppy heads to do a massive cover crop in in your indoor garden or even in a massive outdoor
garden and that's like immediately readily available phosphorus so we always like to end our
flowering with with poppy and in between you can just look at different values mineral values of
different seed varietals and say oh yeah that would be cool to try during this time and
use your intuition use your creativity come up with new things of course it's all about
finding what works for you absolutely i see a few different uk grow and hydro stores now stocking
some of your products which is absolutely fantastic to see i note this because the uk
has historically been a very kind of you know hydro or soilless dominated market do you feel
like the tides are finally turning in this regard and how can we help to crack hydro store strongholds
so to speak just through education i think that even the hydro stores um you know have been taught
the wrong thing they were taught by big ag you know npk ratios and they thought that that was
what was the right thing to do and if we have the opportunity to bring a totally regeneratively grown
indoor deep cultivated soil with dragonfly earth medicine buds into a hydro store and say look at
what is possible that's an incredible education you know to them as well so do i think that the
tides are turning hell yeah the tides are definitely turning and the tides are turning
because microbiology is making a comeback in the cannabis world and the more that we create healthy
microbiology the more healthy microbiology enters our own microbiome which makes us more intelligent
which makes us make better decisions which helps us educate the the grow stores and and i think
that you know like i said before we're on an incredible bell curve and we all just need to
run with that and not feel like oh well if i'm just getting into the game and i'm just learning
about this that i have nothing to offer you have tons to offer everybody has something to offer
that is some kind of a teaching around nature or a way to do it better that's better for the earth
so i see on some of these stores that you guys have got your own molasses product which is great
because i always had people ask me a lot of questions about molasses and some of the variants
like treacle and the black strap molasses and all that what type of molasses do you guys like to use
and how do you like to use it well um definitely organic black strap molasses would be you know
something that people usually cut corners on but um we're not we don't actually even use molasses
anymore you know or any kind and we don't actually have a molasses product well that's that was the
dragonfly europe and that yeah so that was there was some you know enough in europe to have it but
the the point is do you use molasses or not and initially it was like you know tablespoon per
gallon molasses and that's going to add to your microbiology but i feel over the years of testing
that um the the sweetener and adding molasses and sugars has really been overdone and could
potentially spike pathogens in your teas as well so um if you're going to use molasses
make sure it's organic because a lot of people will cut that corner and it can be a really good
iron you know iron or mineral supplement to to your teas but i would not overuse it but use it
in very trace amounts there's such a tremendous amount of sugars already in plants and um you
know we can really see that with if you're feeding your soil a whole lot of sugars it's really no
different than if you're feeding your own body a whole lot of sugars you're going to have more
yeast problems um which is you know pathogenic yeast and soils sort of have that more mildews
you could have all different types of yeah it's going to throw off your ph it's going to make it
way more acidic and repetitive uses yeah so just be really careful in nature you know plants survive
off other plant juices there isn't really like molasses that comes into nature so really think
about your microbiology and and like i was talking about before you know that first drop and how many
ripples it can create you know look at that last ripple and you and you want it to be a healthy
balance all the way through and when you use lactic acid bacteria to break down plant you
know juices and weeds there's there's a lot of living material in there and a lot of sugars that
are just naturally present so it's it's kind of a it balances itself out we don't use any extra
sugars on our property okay and if someone did want to use sugars like in say like a molasses
form or something along those lines is there one that you would use preferentially because i've had
someone ask me you know should i use honey should i use molasses should i use agave nectar and when
it came down to it i thought well molasses has got a few little extra minerals in it but i mean i'm
not sure if there's too much of a difference what do you guys think there's a big difference yeah
there's a big difference honey can have all different its own different microbiome um honey
is alive um especially if it's non-pasteurized um it's alive it has so many different types of
things in it so that i can throw off it can be antibacterial in some forms too and different
things yeah so you know as raw of a good sugar as you can get that's not highly processed and that's
totally organic is the one that we suggest and also to use it in very very low ratios a half a
teaspoon per gallon really is all you need to spark those initial that initial microbiology it
sparks those initial bacteria but it's really no different in a brew than in the body you know when
you're feeling a low blood sugar and you eat a candy bar you know that that candy bar is only
going to last so long but if you eat like something really high protein and really rich and full
balance then that's going to keep your blood sugar going for a really long time and the teas are no
different in you know you don't want to burn out your microbiology you want to give it something
that it can feed off of long term as well and the best i think the best syrup or the best
sweetener that you can use is yacon syrup and i'll spell that y-a-c-o-n and yacon is a south
american tuber that's really watery and really sweet and it's a prebiotic that's really high
in inulin and it can be really good for human consumption as well but it's often boiled down
and and juiced and it creates a molasses and we are growing a lot of yacon on our property and
encouraging a lot of farmers to grow yacon on their property and that's a real and you can also
sometimes find it in a natural food store yacon syrup everyone you hear that store that away in
a neuron somewhere what would you say to someone who says that they really want to get into organics
and you know they really feel passionately about the general message being put forward by dragonfly
however they just feel like they can't quite get their crops high enough to merit switching over
um i think that you just have to try it out you know it's no different and whenever you try
something new there's always a learning curve there has to be a learning curve i mean if there's
no learning curve then we we wouldn't be learning how to get better and better at things and um we
hear that a lot and then we also hear the same person say that come back a year later and be like
oh my god are you kidding me i can't even believe that i ever thought that i couldn't have higher
yields or that i couldn't grow better medicine so we know that organics and living natural
biological soils is the way to go because that's what plants grow in um it was humans that took
them and put them in some other type of a medium and tried to you know create that growing
cultivation practice and i just think give it give it a little bit of time learn as much as you can
be curious be creative get new ideas and share them and maybe it's not just about you know the
ending yield maybe it's the journey along the way and all of the good information that you're going
to get and all of the good microbiology that you're going to get along the way as well that's
going to help you become a better gardener in the end anyway so if this was someone's primary
concern for switching to organics for example if you're forced to grow in a non-organic way
just specifically to get enough yield to say support yourself do you feel like there's been
a certain something missed there in respects to their relationship with the plant well what's
missing is that it's actually the opposite that in a lot of legalized and recreational
jurisdictions it's actually you have to grow it regeneratively organically in order to pass all
these tests so it's it's kind of turned into a good thing for an organic farmer because in the
end it's it's kind of yeah i think a lot of people have said oh well in these new systems you almost
have to grow organically because there's too many residues and different things that show up
in the flowers so i think you have to ask yourself what are you having your relationship with
are you having your relationship with the fear of losing your job and being forced into something
that you may not believe in and may not even be part of your ethics or are you having a relationship
with the cannabis plant and i think that's just something that you want to ask yourself some
people just want to have a relationship with the money and do a nine to five and um you know not
think about anything else and and you know there's a whole lot of people on the planet like that
i personally want to have a relationship with everything that i do in my life and i know
josh feels the same way we just want to be involved and want to be able to have integrity
with what we're doing so that we can be proud of it and so that we can be interested in it and so
we can remain creative with it and we're not just working a nine to five and we're looking at the
bottom line um and in a way that i could really tell people who only are looking at that bottom
line polyculture is equally as important as poly economy we cannot just be growing cannabis maybe
anymore why not have an early spring crop of strawberries on your land or try to diversify
with other things you know we can't just be selling a pound of weed anymore and think that
that's going to suffice for us we have to become product makers we have to have an ending product
that brings more value to our flowers so that we can bring value to organics and have a higher
quality product we have to become more creative and and that is what's going to give us more value
for what we're doing and more value for the product in the end definitely definitely so how
do you think we can go about raising the general perception in the mind of the consumers about the
quality of outdoor because at the moment as maybe ideologically inaccurate as it may be there is the
general consensus that people want you know to quote that indoor um how do we go about changing
that so that people are demanding that high quality organic outdoor right well i think it matters where
you live you know what i mean i think that uh people are not being able to see good quality
outdoor and you know the indoor that's around people think that it's just about the looks when
it's really about so much more than that so i think it's just a matter of education and and i
mean we've brought our cannabis to different cups and different things and i mean it's incredibly
crystally and it looks really beautiful it smells really good and i think that in certain ways we've
redefined what's even possible to grow outdoors up in british columbia and um you know the light
deprivation has added a lot of quality to sun-grown you know plants so light depth is is a really easy
sell to people and um i think that just having a good cure and a good quality um way of harvesting
your sun-grown and just being able to do it right i think when people say you know can i make the
leap of faith to organics i mean it's not much of an actual leap because you know just building a
really good soil and having a really quality stable base within your soil is going to give you
the ability to take advantage of the sun and create and create you know good flower from it
so we see really amazing outdoor sun-grown cannabis so i think you know it's possible to
do it in other areas and you know it's what it's what makes people feel better most of the time too
yeah and i think that people who say that you know indoors better than sun-grown they just
haven't had good sun-grown i mean that's really what it comes down to which is what josh pretty
much just said and i think that that's important so the more sun-grown that's out there with really
good varietals that do well you know in the sun because what people are doing is that they're
taking these indoor varietals or a clone or a seed that it's been grown indoors for a really long
time in a synthetic environment or in in a soilless medium and then they try to grow it outside and
they don't understand why it doesn't do very well well that plant doesn't have the intelligence
um of a natural system it's lost its intelligence it's lost the ability you know to be able to
uptake and grow to its full potential because it's only been used to sort of that ivy feeding
more allopathic npk that doesn't understand microbiology or an endophytic um you know
reaction within the plant so you know outdoor is really wonderful when you're working with
outdoor strains and just like josh said i i mean i wish i could give every single person
out there listening you know one of our flowers and you know they would they would say something
really different and there's often a really good feeling that comes with it i mean if we hear that
a lot you know people smoke our weed and they're like oh you know i i usually have a certain feeling
associated with it but i think when you get a really good sun-grown herb and and even with
and in our experience people have a better feeling from it so i mean if you're going
why are you smoking the weed are you smoking the weed because of what it looks like or are you
smoking the weed because of how it feels so maybe you know challenge yourself on on what why you're
doing it definitely so the pure seal itself is very much communally orientated and accredited
certification do you see this model expanding into other facets of the community over say
multiple avenues and specifically do you think we'll ever see something like say a pure dispensary
where it's just full of flowers and products produced under the pure certification yeah it's
happening already so it's exciting this is already happening and product makers want to have the pure
certification so that they're only sourcing flowers from pure certified farms and it creates
this beautiful sacred commerce that's regenerative and yeah there's been lots of talk about that
there's dispensaries that totally want to come on board and and see what that's like so what we're
looking at as a whole collective right now is different certifications uh that's still pure
certified um that represents that same really high quality and community monitoring and community run
one of the questions that got submitted by one of our fans was if they say just bought a stock
standard because i know that there's so many variables here let's just say they bought a
pretty standard farm how long would you guess it would take for them to get it up into shape to
the point where it would probably pass the pure certification i mean it's really hard to say i
mean it would take having you know when we say closed loop systems that means some type of system
that you've you know some that works on top of itself some compost or some you know good things
that you have that you're catching water saving water making your own seeds i mean i would say
you know you can't just get it and within two weeks maybe you've bought someone else's farm
that's already done something really amazing i mean you could actually you know come in on and
and pretty quickly then we've we've had people take you know five years that are just coming to
it that said we're finally ready we've been five years in the making and we really want to do this
and then we've had other farms that have done it in one year that they put all of their energy and
effort in and every bit that they had you know to creating more closed loop systems um so it's
really not a time thing it's an energy thing and and and also depending on where you are because
if you're in the tropics being closed loop is is a whole lot easier than if you're in the desert
so you know there's different variables for people but what is really cool is that the
tremendous amount of closed loops that have come to our attention you know like people have created
closed loops out of just pure brilliance and that's just really awesome so yet again it brings
that intuitive sense of creativity and and that your land is specific to you and that you know
everybody is a little bit different in the way that you do things on your own land or in your
own indoor garden or your own tiny backyard garden you know is it's a holistic certification
so you know you have to be ready to not be using non you know toxic substances like butane or
propane or some type of high we don't allow hydrocarbon extracts like we've talked about
before and and people can you know tell us how clean it is and they can give us tests and they'll
say all kinds of things but in the end we just for us it's a toxic compound and and to clean it
a toxic compound out seems counterintuitive and it's just it's it's supporting an industry that
creates a you know toxic compound and and that's not okay so as a you know pure certified farmer
you just have to be able to have a food garden and you have to be able to have
flowers growing and you have to be able to have some you know ways of making soil and you have to
be able to have a functional farm and you know that can come within one year it might take a few years
of course so to change the topic ever so slightly what are some cultivars or strains you've been
vibing with a lot lately well um you know there's a lot of hemp strains that are being you know
explored and those are really interesting to us right now because some of them are you know really
high in terpenes and and other ones are high in cbg and other ones are high in cbd thcv and
different things so right now we're just really interested in exploring uh you know cultivars that
are unique you know i mean and and so some of those cultivars are i mean it's the cherry wine
has been around for a while as a hemp cultivar but we've been playing around with the cherry wine and
the auto and the spectrum and those have been really interesting and um yeah we're we're looking
into doing some more varieties on that front um and we've been still you know moving forward our
own varietals uh you know we have our 840 male that we still work with um as well as other males
that have been made off of that you know our zellies gift we rejuvenated this year and we did
some inline breeding with it um way back so something that's been really interesting to us
is we brought out a lot of our early 2000 seeds just recently for all of our varietals on for this
year and now we're growing them again so we can re-breed those back in and we can really create
stability and what we're seeing in stability which you know stability is a shaky term in the
cannabis industry and i realize that but what we're seeing is as we
bring even our lineage further of what's interesting to us um we're choosing plants
and then they're being tested we're really moving into and most of our varieties are full spectrum
full terpene and that just seems to be coming naturally with with treating them well and so
we've been even seeing some of our old like temple spice varietal now that's starting to
have cbd creep into it so i think that it you know we're moving along our own stuff and and
like josh said we're like now 80 hemp on our property and we're really interested in working
with a hemp varietal that finishes here so our really big goal this year in breeding is to try
to bring forth an early finishing high cbd hemp varietal and also we're working with some auto
flower seeds that we got from heart rock mountain and the cali gold and that's been a project they've
been working on for a long time and so we're excited to you know to work with some auto flowers
um and we are you know working with some hash varieties that we've gotten from uh you know kush
kirk and and some 24k varieties and um some snapple cookie varieties and and different things like
that just to see you know what kind of uh syrup we can get just kidding but we have reindeer
reindeer syrup is is a is another variety that's a root or alice strain that we've been you know
that we're that we're going to try out and um so that's really interesting this year i don't know
we've gotten a lot of strains from a lot of different people this year we're just doing our
best to do a little bit of everything just to see to further explore you know what we're what we can
grow you know we've got some land race varieties happening some melana creams um going and yeah
yeah really nice diverse mix of genetics there when can we expect to see the launch itself of
dragonfly genetics because a few people have told me they're hunting for your seeds like nothing else
and you know the struggle is real to get them certainly seems like there's demand when is it
going to be time um you know maybe we'll do some this fall this fall might be a good idea to to do
that and you know we have given out a lot of seeds when we see people and uh you know i guess it's
just a matter of you know making it happen and we make a whole lot of seeds every year and we give
them all away so our genetics are out there and uh i guess it's just people that see us in passing
we're happy to gift them with varietals but we do always ask people you know how are you going to
grow these and it's a really nice idea for us to know that our seeds are going out into a respectful
garden or you know somebody that's gonna turn them into something really cool um but i you know i
don't know we just keep giving them away and people keep out i think that we give away too
many to actually sell any so yeah we'll see what we really want is a field test kit so that we can
really do you know a lot of the breeding that we really you know analyze a you know the an
analyzing on our own property so i mean eventually we get a good field testing kit and that would
really help our breeding and that would really help us you know feel good about putting seeds out
into the world of course and i know that you have some interesting kind of collaborations or at least
working closely with snodgrass family farm genetics can you tell us a little more about this
well you know they they have really amazing breeding projects that they're a part of and
since they're you know family to us you know we've we've traded genetics back and forth over the years
and um really um bobby and meredith just have a really beautiful piece of land and and they're
just exploring you know genetics that have come to them throughout their things so we don't have
any collaboration you know official collaborations happening um at the moment other than we've been
sharing seeds for years and breeding off of each other's stuff so in that way it's really
collaborative yeah no it would be really fun to come out with something with something together
when we come with something when we get to something that's really beautiful but
um yeah i would know they every year they they explore a huge variety of genetics and do a lot
of breeding so it's always really interesting to find out what they come up with and would you ever
consider doing like a rather formal collab with someone who you really closely align with like
maybe you know duke diamond or someone along those lines who you respect and vibe with their work
already always oh yeah for sure we love that yeah we're all about collaborating you know in any way
that we can with information with uh you know good flowers with seeds we even have some heavy days
genetics going on right now yeah we do i'm saying we're pretty stoked so you know there could be a
collab coming right there just saying big grin on my face thanks very much guys um so the next
thing i wanted to ask you they're coming up really beautiful by the way really gorgeous so
super excited about it oh you guys are too kind i'm sure you're giving them a very loving home
oh we for sure are so with that being said how important is it in your opinion to continually
be pheno hunting it's everything i mean that's what makes it exciting if we're not pheno hunting
then i always feel like what am i doing you know everything that we've gotten up to this point we
did without you know only maybe in the last five years have we been doing it even any testing
everything was pheno hunting and what it smelled like and what it looked like and how it did in
the garden and what it made you feel like when you smelled it or touched it or you're next to
it or when you smoked it or you ingested it or put it into your food you know pheno hunting is
is being a cannabis cultivator they go hand in hand so this is a bit of a peculiar one but i
really wanted to kind of dig in here but i tried some mac one that was grown in the states outdoors
with you know the kind of the pure type of i think it was grown on a pure farm but you know if not
we'll just say you know very closely aligned with that type of thing and to be honest it just didn't
come across to me as it was on the same level as some of the indoor stuff in terms of the caps in
terms of the mac specifically and so my question is do you feel like there may be some cuttings
that are just more suited for outdoor than indoor or for indoor than outdoor or do you think that
anything has the potential to shine just as good in either or um well i think that i touched on
that a little bit before is that you know a lot of these varietals uh have been grown indoor for so
long they've been cuttings off of indoor they've been put in synthetic or soilless mediums and they
don't really have the intelligence to to go into an outdoor uh cultivation you know methodology or
practices so you know particularly with the mac that's a really indoor varietal and you know it's
been cloned off a whole bunch of times so i think it would take you know several runs if we ever get
an indoor clone uh from somebody or something that we're really interested in wanting to grow out
we take a couple of years to grow it out to see what its full potential is because guaranteed if
we're getting a synthetic clone from somebody it takes a long time for that clone to come to its
full potential because it doesn't have the intelligence of biological uptake so you know
it's going to take some time and i think that the plant's intelligence needs to match the intelligence
of the soil of course so something i wanted to ask you guys your perspective on was the use of
quote natural growth regulators so i know that i've heard and seen a lot of people using gibberellic
acid in the vegetative stages and some people will consider this to be on par if not the same
thing as using pgrs you know the more kind of synthetic natural ones but other people will say
oh but it's just a natural hormone that's in the plant anyway where do you sit on that do you view
it as a natural thing or as a synthetic thing well gibberellic acid is a natural compound that's
found in nature so i wouldn't say it's not a synthetic compound but i think that you know
anything that's been it could be that it's synthesized and it could be that some of those
i think it's kind of like do you like isolate you know cbd or do you like full spectrum
you know medicine i think that you know when you start just using gibberellic acid on its own
you know you're you're you just don't know what the source is and i think that you can get plenty
of gibberellic acid just in like nettles or you know in some kind of plant and i would just much
rather get it from that so you know to me that's just uh it's kind of like using an isolate
that's what i think yeah okay and so would you view it i guess just as a clarifying point as
somewhat akin to uh tricontinol where it's like yeah we just get it from the alfalfa it's all good
exactly that would be that's a perfect analogy i mean it's kind of like yeah exactly it's just
you know humans desire to think that it's one compound over the all it's not to say you know
cbd on its own can cure but you know the whole entourage is way better gibberellic acid you know
on its own can grow plants exponentially and i've even heard with feminization that
gibberellic acid used in conjunction with colloidal silver in the early flowering stages
can be a way to feminize your plant is silver theosulfate which is what's commonly used for
feminization so you know um gibberellic acid is is is a really heavy um growth hormone
and yeah so i i anything that's isolated like that we're just automatically skeptical of
and we don't use it yeah good point good point so i'm gonna take a bit of a step off the edge
here and talk about something random that i saw the other day on instagram but i'd love to gauge
your opinion on it what do you think about the introduction of mushroom spores from psychedelic
mushrooms into your grow media because i mean i'm sure we've all seen the odd mushroom pop its head
up throughout a flowering cycle when you flip the lights on what if it turns out you know you had
some cubensis or something like that pop up well i mean i think then you would have the most awesome
thing in the world happening you know because who who wouldn't want psychedelic mushrooms
popping up underneath their their ganja i mean any any sane person would want that you know
so i'm gonna i'm gonna say that you know to say psychedelic mushrooms is you know a little bit
broad so you'd have to go a little bit deeper you'd say okay which ones do i want wood loving
psychedelic natural mushrooms like azure essence or cyan essence or um uh potent psilocybe which is
already the cyan essence but anyway those are wood loving so you you could inoculate um you could get
wild and spores and wild patches in mycelium and and inoculate those in your grow medium you would
just have to be pretty you know intentional about giving it enough other other um food to eat like
so wood chips you know a lot of people are doing hugel culture and wood chips well that works
really really good for um wood loving psychedelic mushrooms so i think that's really really smart
when it comes to um cubensis that's going to be more of a manure loving mushroom so
um a way that a person could utilize a cubensis run would be to um you know make compost
and sterilize your com put your compost with you know through turning um the compost and then
you know you'd have to know mushroom cultivation but you could inoculate a manure compost and put
it on as a top dress to your plants and grow a flush of cubensis with your weed
but cubensis really likes super high humidity and and flowering cannabis doesn't necessarily like
super high humidity so that's true it's really awesome balance that you gotta find there it
would be like you would want to have your mushrooms flowering during vegetative time
and then be done the best way to do that before flowering two greenhouses one on one side which
is a flower flushing um mushrooms and that one on the other and that would be pushing
co2 air into the other greenhouse which was growing weed and that would be beautiful
and so what are some mushrooms be it psychedelic or not that you would recommend people to try to
incorporate into their life and ingest kind of regularly if possible all the medicinal mushrooms
reishi chaga cordyceps agaricon um turkey tail so when it comes to lion's mane it's a nootropic
there's so much damage that's going on within our brains within wi-fi that we need to start
introducing nootropic medicine which is lion's mane um you know incorporating a lot of the
different tree polypores because then it takes all of the intelligence from the tree and puts it into
the polypore and then it makes it where you're actually getting direct tree medicine through
the the polypore so allying with mushrooms right now at this time of earth's toxicity is really
important and then how do you utilize that in you know in what mushrooms do you use in your
cannabis grow because a lot of ones she she mentioned like chaga is not one that you can
grow you know that's that's a wild mushroom that only grows on birch trees but um you know you can
inoculate logs and use that as a as as a way of building your beds and you could have reishi
or lion's mane or mitake logs making a raised bed and you can bury um lion's mane logs in the
soils so there are ways of of building your soils with medicinal mushrooms um through log spawn
so people can look up log spawn and find out more about that but that's and then also garden giants
like kelly said is king straferia orugoso onulata and that's really amazing compost eating mushroom
and it's really useful in living soils and if you and if you can't grow it then find somebody who
is growing it you know in an organic um cultivation because yeah allying with medicinal mushrooms are
really important and a lot of them you can't grow you know like lion's mane it's something that would
be difficult to to grow inside of your indoor cultivation of cannabis but you certainly can
find it out in the woods or you can find somebody else that's cultivating in it in a respectful way
turkey tail is another one you can grow on the logs yeah and like agaricon is is almost
impossible to get unless you're buying like the mycelium of somebody who is cultivating the
mycelium or reishi you know it's it's sometimes finicky depending on where you're growing it so
it i think we we think that it's okay to be sourcing it from other people that are growing
organic medicinal mushrooms as well it's hard to spread yourself that thin right
i mean it's i think it's a crucial part of a really sweet like farm to have mushrooms growing
on it so i you know we're all about you know people taking it on oyster mushrooms i mean that
can be a huge easy thing to grow on your property yeah definitely i think i'm probably gonna go eat
some after this there you go so this is something i've been dying to ask you guys about for a while
how do you feel about the rise of what i call cbd everything so like you know cbd burgers from in
and out and cbd candy from the gas station is this a positive thing yeah we have cbd gas we just got
for our car it was incredible the car really loved it um yeah well it's great because then more hemp
is being farmed and there's more people cultivating it then the plant gets to come more out of her
prohibition she gets to like make make more of a scene you know into the world and and more and
more people are cultivating her and as more hemp is is being grown more land is being remediated
and that's a huge positive um on the earth so it's cbd everything hurrah then that also means
that people's cannabinoid receptors are going to start getting flooded and that's wonderful too
and that's only going to help people become more healthy i mean it feels like you know
a phase and it feels like something that's
bad and it's kind of like you know maybe it makes you roll your eyes in a little bit but it's just
kind of a testimony of just like create rules and everyone's just going to exploit it on on all
fronts so i mean really the main teaching is you know to to think that cbd is like the be all end
all compound is really not true i mean so it's just it doesn't have thc in it so it's a non
it's non-intoxicant so people can put it in everything and i mean if people was putting a
full spectrum extract in there instead of just cbd i mean that would be awesome and i would love to go
i would love to have it in everything i eat because really we that's why our we have an
endocannabinoid system is for it to be fully saturated you know and having it in your foods
and smoking and our ways of doing that so i think it could be really healthy and maybe back in
evolution hemp was fed to animals and animals ate it and cbd and all the compounds were in the animal
and then the people ate the animals and so i think that hemp and cannabinoids were have been
an essential part of our food chain through evolution so really it's only respectful to
our evolution that we have now cbd products and everything i just think that maybe we should demand
more than just cbd of course and so how do you feel about vape pens are they a necessary evil
and given they do have generally speaking such a bland cannabinoid profile how do you think we can
go about getting this what seems to be like a vital stepping stone between the casual enthusiasts and
the more hardcore fans to incorporate a more holistic profile in it and really give people
these medicinal benefits they're maybe not seeing otherwise yeah i mean you know the vape pen is
kind of like the remote control like for the tv you know like back when it was just convenient
you know it was just it didn't really matter you could still you know do whatever you needed without
it but the vape pen is just kind of like people want to drive around or travel to other countries
and have a vape pen it's just it's like it's more of like a lifestyle thing you know nowadays i think
the thing that sucks about vape pens is that they're just such a
that they're vape pens well i mean the thing that sucks about vape pens is that they're vape pens
and anyway so but they're very convenient for people and i think that's what people
also have you know depending a high so a high quality vape pen would be one that doesn't have
weird residues on it because of where it was manufactured in china so vape pens can be toxic
to the consumer and also toxic to the environment because they're just disposable so an ecologically
minded person really doesn't love vape pens i guess that would be my answer or make sure that
they're refillable and you know ones that because like josh said i think steep hill just did a
massive study a blind case study of shopping and all the different dispensaries and they found that
i don't know the percentage but an overwhelming percentage of the vape pens you know were just
toxic in and of themselves because of the coil that was heating up so i think that we can do
better i just i think that you know with these beautiful extracts that can be made from flour
i think that we can do better and um you know refillable reusable ones that have glass
um also people are maybe a hemp plastic vape pen you know i mean let's just hope that innovation
can catch up if we can get a good you know vaping unit that makes it there's there's maybe reasons
why vaping makes sense you know it's less smoke and it's less carbon and if you have a challenged
lung i mean i'm not gonna demonize anything i think we can be a non-discriminatory
non-discriminatory ganja ingesters i think what you know it's the right place at the right time
you know why didn't rome do as the romans you know i mean like you might have to smoke out of a vape
pen you know what i mean every once in a while but i'm not you know you know it's not going to be the
natural choice of course so one thing i wanted to bring up with you guys before we jump on to some
of our fans suggested questions was this idea of the green renaissance i know that julie and the
good folk over at skunk magazine have been pushing this idea hard and you guys are well on board with
it too what kind of stimulated you to push and put your backing behind this idea of the green
renaissance well i just think that it's kind of what makes sense it's what's natural you know we
like like julia stated it's you know it's it's not a rush you know it's more of an awakening
it's more of a reawakening and uh um you know something that's more long-lasting and it kind
of has an essence to it so you know it just it feels good to to think of it as you know something
that's emerging and and you know a lot of people talk about you know kids don't want to be farmers
anymore and and indigenous cultures in different places in the world but actually a lot of kids do
want to be farmers thanks to weed you know what i mean as long as the governments don't fuck it up
too much you know we might be able to you know have a lot of young amazing farmers that want to
grow you know because we get people that are young all the time that'd be like you know the greatest
dream on earth would be to have their own farm so um i think that you know there's just a lot of
ways to look at things of course so we might slide into some of the fans suggested questions
these are in no particular order or rank but the first one i've written down what are some inputs
that people can easily grow for themselves on a small scale that would be beneficial to both their
gardens and possibly even their body nettle comfrey um alfalfa is awesome super easy to grow
you can cut alfalfa so many times in a year and it just keeps coming up same with comfrey um those
are all really easy things to grow edible flowers are really great to grow you know they contain
you know terpenes and and they're nice for our own bodies and i think you know lots of different
diversity um is is great but those are the four that are really easy to grow and anyone can do it
i mean you can grow yarrow you know there's there's a lot of different um foliar sprays that
you can i mean if you can grow ginger and gar i mean really i think this is what you should grow
is as much as you can like what how about this what can you grow grow that because really it's
it's not just like choosing one thing you know there's it's there's a world out there we're on
the internet right there anyone lives wherever they live they could be in sao paulo brazil right
now and 20 million people around them and what can they grow they can just grow simple cover crops
and pots and then just take the cover crop and cut it and make a fermented plant juice out of it
and they can water all their plants you know in their house from that um you know there's there's
so many things you can grow and i think it's just the explore botany you know understand
kinship gardening and the evolution of plants and just try and grow as much as you if you can grow
a moringa tree that would be awesome because you could just sit there and cut the moringa tree back
all day and another thing people can grow is spirulina i mean you can grow algaes in an
aquarium in your house and that's something that's really healthy for you and it's also
good for your garden so and you can grow deciduous trees because leaves are really amazing uh leaf
mold is is so beautiful for soils and that's something that can be collected every fall and
it offers great oxygen around your property so growing fruit trees also you can use fruit there's
yeah really the sky is the limit just what what grows well in your zone and area that you feel
like you can take on that makes it really easy that then will make you more curious to want to
grow more things and there's lots of plants with known high biomass so those that look for plants
high in biomass definitely spirulina is definitely one that's been on my radar for a minute now and
it ties into this next question of what is a good place to start in regards to bringing what
would be considered a very nutrient deficient soil back to life what are some of the ingredients you
would first and foremost be looking to incorporate um well life so you know you could plant cover
crops on it and turn that in and that would be the a really fast simple way go to the forest and
find some area that is is living and really healthy you can bring that back i would look
maybe to worm castings or some kind of compost or composted manure or some kind of animal healthy
animal place that's near you maybe someone has alpacas or llamas or something or rabbits
and you can get some good pigeons i mean you can get some pigeon poop and chickens something like
that you don't want to overdo it with that kind of stuff because it can be hot but if you're trying
to get quick life back in there you know animal manures when when it's coming from a healthy
source is a really good way of doing it or worm castings and and one of the most immediate ways
that people in suburban areas is just always keep a nice compost going and having worms in it so
that you always have good accessible inoculant biology soil to put on top of any of your plants
at any time so just using your kitchen scraps and then that makes people more knowledgeable about
hey maybe i want to grow organic food because then that's going into my compost pile which my
worms are eating which is then going to go into my cannabis and and put bokashi and you know
bokashi and when your food scrap so your food scraps are already pre-digested when they when
they go on the worm farm you know at one point you're just playing you know what i mean yeah okay
so the next question i have i'm honestly not too sure about the context of so i'm just hoping
you guys kind of understand it better than what i do but someone said how do you feel about the
flow canna slash other sellouts and how all of the regenerative cannabis farming award recipients get
lumped into this same group well i mean to say that the regenerative farm award winners got
lumped into a group is just it's not it's not like it wasn't premeditated by any means it was
what it was was flow khana was wanting to work with really intentional conscious farmers in
northern california and when you win the farm award you just get to be known and people are
like hey i want to get your product so i mean i think it was just uh you know it was just kind
of a natural thing you know um what the pro i think here's the i think what the problem is is
that when companies get really really huge they start taking investment from other companies
and with flow khana they just got really huge and they took investment from companies
that are not in line with regenerative practices so it put it's starting it started to put
an ethical question in with the farmers so you know what they're what you know what you want them
to to be doing a good thing but when they're taking investment from companies you know that
are connected to marlboro or altria or companies that are you know harmful to the earth you just
have to it's it's really hard to navigate you know that territory so people are torn i would
just say in the community right now you know on on that subject right now because of those
because of those principles and and it's really important to say that you know there are there are
you know new horizons that uh cannabis farmers haven't thought about before you know when cannabis
farmers are signing contracts that's why we were saying it's so important to only sign protracts
right now because and and we can use this as an example you know when when farmers are signing
contracts they weren't necessarily thinking about well geez this company could sell out to something
else and then where is my ip and and where is is is my sops you know within that or what is the
where is my branding of my own farm so it just is really giving us the ability to become more
intelligent and more savvy with the corporate cannabis world and i think the more that we see
you know what corporate cannabis um you know is capable of is the more that we need to come up
with smarter alternatives but you know with the flow connothing they have really beautiful farms
that are working with them and they have not changed and how they're cultivating and they
haven't you know they're still growing regenerative and they're still you know creating wonderful
community and they're and everybody is really wonderful it's just we're being caught in a
corporate riffraff that as cannabis farmers we are new to and we need to become more savvy it's
similar to what happened with phyllis too i mean they started joining forces with singenta and
monsanto and and dow chemicals and all these things that's just when you start getting you
know that that much investment you start having to like what you'd say sell your soul you know to to
the monster and that's why we were just saying we want to be independent of that and we don't want
to be swallowed by corporations that's just you know it's new it's new territory we we have to be
dolphin pods in an ocean of sharks yeah great analogy so where do you hope to see the craft
cannabis market in 10 years from now and how do you think big ag will factor into this picture
well i think big ag can just folly around with the idea that they can cultivate cannabis in a way
that's you know better for people i think it's just going to be funny to watch them you know
fall on themselves over and over and i had to be like whatever on that front i think
um craft whether it's you know when someone says the word craft cannabis i mean you would
have you know to me i'm like does that mean organic or regenerative so it's not descriptive
enough and so just because they're small doesn't necessarily make them good so if it's craft and
a better i would hope that it's already regenerative or you know i i use the word
regenerative instead of organic because we want you know you know more than organic so
and in the future what i would like to see is a really huge value for consciously cultivated
cannabis what i would like what i i'm assuming that it's going to be like safeway or some kind
of large supermarket chain selling food all over the place but the farmer's market in any town is
always going to have better food i think that there's going to be like microbrews or more
valuable or something like that i think that you know consciously cultivated small farms that have
better strains and a better story i'd like to see that that be a really well-defined
um you know market to where people are really well educated on what corporate cannabis looks like and
what potentially regenerative craft cannabis looks like and i think that you know it's really easy to
greenwash and it's super easy to greenwash the term craft so just because they're small are they
using the same synthetic nutrients that big corporate cannabis is using it definitely needs
to be more definitive and you know what we want to see in 10 years from now in the cannabis industry
is much more conscious cultivation because the earth needs it we need it as it's you know as
its consumer and the plant really deserves it for um you know healing us for you know so many years
since the beginning of humanity and i'd like to see processors and really conscious food companies
and which we are seeing so you know what we're seeing is the beginning of conscious commerce i
mean a company that wants to make a cannabis product has to source their products if they
go to source their products and they come across the pure certification and pure farms i mean
it's kind of a no-brainer i mean it of course they want that so i would i would i'm seeing a
high value for consciously cultivated products and i guess we can just leave it there i think
that's going to grow it does grow that's why natural food stores are growing that's why
the whole movement is growing because people want they're tired of being sick and the system and
corporations just are constantly making us sick everywhere and it's just it's not cool and that's
why CBD is so popular because it all of a sudden is offering an alternative it's giving us a little
bit of a gauge on what's happening with humanity and what's happening with society right now
is that people are you know feeling disenfranchised and disillusioned from big pharma and big ag we're
learning how to do it better and heck if if it's going to be cannabis that leads the way that's
going to give people you know more knowledge of ways to do it better than that's freaking awesome
so you know a lot of people are saying oh CBD this CBD that well that's definitely a gauge on what
society is wanting and that's outside of the pharmaceutical world right now and to me that's
awesome so given the success of the dragonfly of the dragonfly brand in regards to cultivating
sustainable cannabis do you have any plans or interests to become involved in say larger scale
production of hemp well we're definitely interested in hemp production and you know how large can it
be is basically what we're looking at this year you know i mean this is a year when we're deciding
whether feminized seed hemp growing is something that we certify we're deciding on you know can
there be a 100 or a 400 acre hemp farm you know can a 400 acre hemp farm be pure certified or
regenerative we don't have that right now and they would have to really stand out and have some kind
of really thought out you know crop rotations or something happening but we're having those
discussions now really big time within our group as to you know people are saying oh you know is it
scalable well it's really interesting because we utilize the term scalable and big ag and is is
scalable the way that we've been doing it successful and the answer is no so we need to
understand what is scalable for regenerative agriculture period not necessarily what's
scalable for regenerative hemp even but just what's scalable so you know what we see in saving
the earth is you know a ton of small farms small farmers are what is going to save the earth right
now and that absolutely goes into hemp farming if there's big corporate hemp that's going to come in
and they're going to be you know producing 50 million acres of hemp which is what's going on
over in China right now can they do that regeneratively you know we don't really believe
that that's possible we need to bring back the small farmers but at the same time there's a lot
of hemp that's overtaking other crops in the field which is a good thing so large-scale hemp farmers
might be taking a farmer might be growing that instead of something else which they would spray
so you know hemp could be you know is going to be something that's going to save you know
agriculture I think in a lot of ways very much so so this is related specifically to your
I'm gonna have to clarify this and re-ask the question do you pronounce it pagodas well we have
so many different structures on our property we actually have a couple of structures that look
like a pagoda and Josh is an amazing builder and he always takes on a project with like amazing
creativity so every one of our greenhouses you know that's been hand built by us is just really
beautiful it has a style of its own because we want to remain creative and keep the juices flowing
for us too if we're building you know 10 of the same greenhouses it's sort of boring so we're
always trying to keep style and beauty involved on our farm of course of course I love that home
kind of feel they must all have and so just in regards to the various types of structures you
guys have how does it compare having one on say a hillside versus on a flat surface like does the
gradient change the dynamics of it and specifically this person wanted to know is airflow problematic
when you're on the side of the hill well for us we have a really beautiful airflow that comes
through off our lake and and our so a hill is really nice to have because it creates natural
airflow in the morning the heat is rising in our valley and the air is always going up and in the
evening it's going down because the air is cooling off so we get a lot of really good you know airflow
and I prefer to have a slope to grow on really because if you have a water source above you then
you can gravity feed everything down and it's kind of you know it's a natural way of collecting
you know you can create different zones and environments really easy by terracing so
by going to Asia you know all these years and even Guatemala and Central America terracing
you know is something that really just caught our eye we're just like oh my god terracing so beautiful
and so we've made really big terraces on our land and what it does is just naturally makes an
environment and then each environment can grow kind of a different thing so a flat a flat surface
is hard to work with you know it's a lot more exposed you have to you know really use trees
I think a lot more for flat surfaces to create environments and and food for us and stuff like
that so our slope you know makes makes helps us out a lot of course we built and we build our
greenhouses to have a flow-through design for air so we don't have any fans in any of our
greenhouses and the way that we utilize them is more of like a roof or an area to where it's
um there's a flow-through design so there's no stagnant energy anywhere. Yep so we've kind of
touched on this before but it's a bit of a specific question so I'll throw it out there
maybe we'll get a specific answer to this specific question but if you were to get a plant from
whatever source it may be a friend just maybe it's just had a bit of a unlucky run with things but
let's just say it's really quite sick and it's not doing too well what would be your protocol for
getting this out of that heavy shocked state and back up and alive and boosted? First of all separate
it from the rest of your your plants that's the first thing that you want to do so many people
feel like oh well just bring it in with my other plants and into my environment where my other
plants are healthy because pathogens you know are so prevalent right now and a lot of them you can't
see with a naked eye like say a broad mite and a rust that is even hard to see even though you can
but you know isolating it and then just putting it in a really beautiful soil immediately and just
giving it teas I always feel like earthworm casting tea is the same as chicken soup if you want to
bring a plant back to life just feed it earthworm casting tea because it's easy it's absorbable
it has all of the nutrients and it's really basic and easy for a plant to uptake because just like
when we get sick it's difficult for us to uptake things because our immune response is low our
microbiology is low you know things are not responding so easily so that's why a lot of
biology and if you can have it outside and have it get rained on or you know if you can you know
use the natural elements to your advantage depending on time of year and everything like
that you know you have to be yeah you have to be smart about it but you know if you can bring it
outside and you know have the natural elements on it that's really smart too.
So this is an odd one but hopefully you're going to have some perspective on it. Do you have any
thoughts on how Vermont was the first state to legalize cannabis via state legislation as opposed
to a referendum and do you think it should have happened by a referendum? I think any way that it
can become legalized is great and it just so happened that in Vermont it became legalized
through more political power rather than people power. Which I think shows the maturity that shows
how it's matured too. I mean Oregon also just through state legislature just is the export
of cannabis to other states so it's not legal to export to other states but within the state of
Oregon it's legal. So what they're saying is you know this is we're ready for this law when it
changes so I think that it's always going to be better you know for long term you know to not
have systems change and stuff like you're not have if it's a vote by the people then you're
basically still against the the legislature and if the legislature makes the decision then you may not
like their decision but it's going to be more stable I think for the states so that's that's
what we think. Yeah good answer good answer. So another specific one but probably going to be
more easier to answer. This fan wants to know do you view comfrey as better to use during a
vegetative phase during a flowering phase or it's equally good for both? I think it's equally good
for both. It can it contains a vast amount of different minerals and if you have a comfrey
patch you know feed your comfrey patch with good teas and stuff as well so it can uptake
good nutrients but it's so well balanced that you can use it during you know from the very
beginning stages of a seedling all the way up until your last day is a flower almost.
And the roots are good on winds. So what would be your go-to source for organic boron because
it's a trace element that's commonly mentioned as lacking in soils but it's also quite difficult
for many people to come across. I don't have an exact source of natural boron other than just
creating really good compost you know from diverse sources and you know getting your boron from
naturally. And if you're really concerned about any type of mineral deficiency within your plant
or in your soil then it's always better to have it come from a plant source rather than a whole
mineral source. It takes a tremendous amount of time for a mineral to break down but if you have
a go-between plant like say that you know borage actually is a good boron plant you can add like a
tremendous amount of that to it and then use that plant in a ferment or chop it up to put it into a
soil because then that's going to become you know equal or very easily absorbable. It's just plants
understand plants and whenever you're utilizing a plant source as your main mineral source it's just
easier for the plant to digest it it's easier for the microbiology to break it down instantly and
it becomes readily available. Yeah good answer. So what kind of resources and approaches would you
recommend we look into using to help educate our politicians and should we be pushing for exclusively
legislation that's designed to help care for the earth at the same time as allowing production
or is simply a foot in the door approach good enough initially?
Well I mean I think ultimately we're you know looking for a full package and there really are
a lot of really good examples of companies that have been able to provide that you know so
there's I don't know of a piece of literature that you could point you know politicians to
that would say you know this is a reason why you should legalize. I just think that there is a lot
of activists out there and people that have really you know made differences in their local jurisdictions
and they're you know they're moving around the country and there's a lot of lawyers that have
become more and more savvy to what works so I think it's just part of the conferences are also
you know connecting people with lawmakers. I think lawmakers are actually looking for
people to communicate with in the community so I think if you make yourself a little bit more
available then you will be able to help change. And I think that any time that we're talking
about agriculture we need to be talking about health and well-being of the earth. That's where
we went wrong. That's the reason why we have tremendous illness on this planet is because
those two conversations didn't go together. We decided that plants and agriculture should be
more involved in science rather than in nature and we really missed the mark there. So hence we
have tremendously sick waterways and soil systems and if we're not having conversations as we move
into the future when we're discussing agriculture about ecology and about healthy water and earth
then we were not doing our job. And I mean the whole entire cannabis industry as we know it
started out as a medical gift to ailments. Whether it was AIDS in San Francisco or
that was the epicenter of legalization was stemmed from that and so it usually a
place becomes medical first and then that becomes recreational afterwards which is
because then the whole medical aspect it gets kind of thrown away because recreational is kind
of just a big tax bracket thing where everyone can get paid and then you kind of forgot that it was a
medicinal thing. Well it's the same thing with cultivation. I mean you'd almost be missing out
to just say oh well let's just legalize weed and just forget about how it grows it doesn't really
matter. You know I think that we should consider hey well this is a medicine and it should be
cultivated like a medicine which is medicinally good for the earth. So for us you know we're just
going to go for the full home run or the you know whatever it is and we're just going to say I think
we should have it all. I think the time is now where this is no time to skimp. I think we should
ask for everything. I think we should have all of it a healthy environment and legalization all of
it but it's medical access you know in Canada it's legal but we've lost access really. I mean
there's less products available to the consumer now through legalization than there was before
and that's lame. Yeah definitely. So this one's a bit of an odd one when I first read it but I mean
you know there's a place for everything right. How would you feel about sprinkling the ashes of a
loved one into the soil and growing a plant from it? Well I mean I think that's a kind of a no-brainer
or maybe that's not a good term to use but I think that's a... My mother is in our greenhouse.
Yeah I mean I think that's just you know sanctifying the ashes. I mean for one ashes are good for soil
so you're good there and you're able to transform the energy and put it into a plant. I mean
maybe you have a placenta too and you put it underneath the tree you know what I mean.
You could go on and on and on. It's the cycle of life and we think it's beautiful. And all of our
dogs are underneath our cannabis plants too. We felt like that was just super respectful why not
a beautiful medicine you know over some something that you loved you know that soul and spirit's not
still there but that body is and it's a wonderful way to respect the body that walked this planet.
Most certainly. So someone wanted to know do you guys offer tours of your farm at all to the public
specifically those who are quite interested in joining the Pure family? You know we do not because
we're really far away and we just don't have the setup to be touring people around and then
and if we the time to I mean as much as I would love to I think it would be healing to the you
know people to be able to come to our farm and I think one day we would love to to do that but
we're just not set up for it. But I think that you know in a way that's kind of cannabis tourism or
it's like eco tourism and I think that is a thing that could be really beautiful for farms and I know
a lot of farms in California and different places are embracing that and bringing people to their
farm and it could be super smart. I think that we just don't do it right now. And we have lots of
farmer friends and people that are in the industry that will come here to get a little bit of
education and then we know that they're going to pass that on or something. So we've been open to
it but really the truth is we are so far away. It's nothing but like us out here and
it's like our own spiritual temple retreat too. So I think we just kind of get rejuvenated by being
on our land and sometimes that's what we need because we have you know a lot going on.
So cannabis packaging and branding has become a focal highlight of discussion in recent weeks. Most
notably anyone who's ever shopped at a dispenser probably has a myriad of containers that are just
starting to accumulate after only ever having a few grams in them. What type of packaging do you
want to see going forward? Well that's a sad reality. There's millions of pounds of garbage
based just on dube tubes which is kind of like amazing. So Sana packaging is one new company
that is making really conscious packaging that is hemp plastic and also they use recycled ocean
plastic and that's pretty cool and that's interesting. It is still plastic in a way but
if it's hemp plastic then that's just awesome. When it comes to biodegradable material the only
thing about biodegradable is it might be GMO biodegradable and you'd have to be careful
of that. So I think that algae, there's algae plastics that are coming out and that's also
something that's of interest. And well and also we package all of our products in glass because we
feel like it's important to also have a reusable packaging. So not just something that's recyclable
something that people can also reuse. I think it's a thing too because I don't in Canada I think for
example I think you can only use if you're a licensed producer I'm pretty sure it's like
you can only use their packaging. And it's really weird black plastic that they just like did some
studies on a couple of months ago and they left it out into the sunshine and realized that it
off-gas like a tremendous amount of toxins. So you know well that's not very creative nor
ecological and it's unfortunate because Canadians are really upset about it as well as a lot of
producers are feeling like wow I've grown this beautiful you know flower and I got to put it
into a weird plastic container that's going to fill up all of the and the plastic that they're
putting in and it's not even recyclable in Canada. So people could grow their own weed and then they
wouldn't have to worry about packaging that's one thing that would help. There you go grow your own.
That's definitely it. So do you think that there has likewise become too much of a focus on the
aesthetics of packaging like is having a fancy packaging like a legitimate reason or claim to
charge more for the exact same product? Well I mean I think it's kind of a bummer to make you
bring your packaging into your pricing. It's kind of like how it's unavoidable. I mean you can't
really do anything about it but I think that you know cannabis packaging oh god it's just
it's a thing that you can't really I don't know I don't really know what to say about it.
It's a necessary evil. Yeah no I agree it's like there's always going to be people who want to
package their product more fancy and more shiny and flashy and that's one thing but then you know
yeah to have these rampant markups is just a bit of a different realm as far as I can see.
I think it's partly standing out you know I mean if you have your own equipment or your
own packaging that you've designed yourself it can help you stand out and at the end of the day
standing out matters and I mean if someone loves their packaging and it's awesome and it's just
sitting out on the counter all day and they're like oh check out this product I mean it helps
you know what I mean so you know if you have to make sales you know might as well be crafty about
it and make something good but you know don't go nutso you know what I mean and create something
that's you know it costs too expensive everything is already too expensive.
Alrighty so I think we are down to our last of the fan submitted questions so it's a good one
I left it to last for a reason. How do you guys feel about cookies in general?
Well I mean it has like the Keebler kind no I'm just kidding but you know it's all about the hype
you know I think it's a flavor you know I mean it's do you like the flavors so I mean you know
I think that a lot of people like the flavor and that's why it sells but I think that people like
wedding cake now too and you know now it's just cakes and cobblers and cookies and you know I mean
gelatos and oh my god you know and the mac and this and that it's just like whatever is the new
flavor I'm surprised there's not a mac and cheese yet you know I'm just waiting for that one to
come out because that's probably going to be pretty sweet you know but you know I I
um but you know I it's a flavor you know I I'm not gonna I I like weed so you know I'll smoke
cookies I I'm and I'll be happily do it you know I'm I'm personally not into that terpene profile
of the cookies um as a midwife for a long time I can smell like cookies from you know 100 other
different bags because it reminds me of breastfed baby poop is what it smells like which is awesome
it's really you know an interesting smell but it's not really a terpene profile that um you know
draws me I mean there's so many flavors but of course tons of people love it and and that's great
yeah okay a lot of a lot of good points in there just to quickly mention I think that uh
old Capulet has made a mac and cheese strain cross mac to cheese well there you go see
if I so if someone's thought about it someone's already done it
that's it right it's one of the rules of the internet I think so um onto our final kind of
little quick fire questions first one I wanted to quickly ask you what type of genetics would
you like to see make a comeback I would like to see um god ones that are
I mean I really love the Al Capulco gold I say bring it back big time love that
you just it's just a you know as much as the original Al Capulco gold and there is like
different strains that people are calling Al Capulco gold and it's not
same but that was really awesome stuff when that was going around yeah I think that just um you
know non-feminized stable bred you know smart strains you know that's what I'd like to see
great answer so if you could offer one or maybe even two tips on selecting a male to our listeners
what would they be um well uh it would be really nice to have a male that is strong and comes up
you know and grows faster I think is a good is a good trait because it shows you know that it's
vigorous and and of course you know rubbing the stem does help you get smells from the male and
I think that you should know what you're looking for in a male because sometimes there's colors in
the leaf or in the stock that show up really early on in life and it can kind of tell you a little
bit about what's happening later in life um you'd want to look at the the leaf structure the um
if you like the node height that that that it's growing maybe it's short maybe it's reaching
um mostly we choose our males like to be really manly so we like our males to be really strong
and and maybe it it fly you know maybe it came to its flowers early so it's an early you know
it's more it's not late flowering you would want to look for something that um progressed faster
and sometimes with disease resistant you'll sometimes get trichomes on the males and that
can you know signal that it's going to be you know more oil rich and oil productive
and uh you know red stocks or red stems can be something that you look for you know it's like
it's really it's depending on what it says hard to say yeah of course it's a it's a varied one right
kind of I mean it's really strain specific I mean if you were you know breeding land race you would
look for the thinnest leaf that you can see you know something like that or you know maybe a fat
leafed hash strain you know I mean there's a lot of it's I love that it's endless it's fractal
medicine yeah just keep so our next one what is one strain that you just never particularly vibed
with um for me definitely cush I don't I don't you know sort of that like traditional like what
people call like a cush flavor which is like really high and like a humulin I don't know
that's not something that I necessarily vibe with and yeah I've really never met an anja plant that
I didn't love but that's just a terpene profile for me and I would agree with Josh I like them all
yeah that's good I remember I asked you that last interview and you gave a similar answer
you were saying you know pretty much like them all so there you go consistency yeah for sure
that's what we like so what is one strain that maybe you tried maybe you had the cutting
but it's now gone it's now either out of existence or simply just out of your hands that you would
like to be able to get back if possible I do really like the Jack Herrera clone that we had
for a long time oh we had such a beautiful cutting it was from Oregon and oh just one of the original
from the Jack Herrera family oh and there was this the white witch which was a from the early
90s and the early trinity the trinity oh that was so beautiful around Eugene like in 1989 and 90
that was really awesome it was just super dank like crazy crystals and just had amazing flavor
and you could that was so good that one was good yeah I mean you know and the list goes on and on
because we grow a thousand plants on our property and you know we don't really clone them so they
could have all been amazing we have a black a black or almost blue grateful breath cherry puff
that was a real amazing and I really hope that we get a good we have some seeds of it and we're
growing it again this year but that would have been another good one yeah I think I remember even
being able to sample that one on the phone how did you like that that one was nice huh it was
phenomenal and I think one of the things which standard out in my memory was that you would
never have been able to guess that that was outdoor growing it looked just as good as anything
you'd ever seen indoor give thanks exactly blessed be that's it so on to our final question
for this chat what is your ultimate goal slash hope for the overall trajectory of our little community
my overall hope is that all of the intentional amazing farmers can continue to stay in business
and make amazing products thrive in business I would like that to thrive I really want
to not get it feels like you're getting penalized for making medicine and you know when you're
getting all these crazy prohibitive licensing and all this stuff it just feels like you're almost
getting punished for like creating medicine and I and I would like to live in a world where
it's not like can you get a license as it's once you have a license it's how good can your medicine
be so I would love to see small farms being able to make really really intentional products and
being able to sell it anywhere in the world I would love to be able to sell our products to
any country in the world and I think that anyone should be able to have access to it and I think
it should be really fun rather than funky you know which is kind of what it is right now so I'd
like to see a world where we have these really beautiful diverse gardens we're growing amazing
plants and it's just simply a matter of our ingenuity to make really good products to be
able to sell them that would be nice and for me I mean just one last you know statement on that
is that I'd really like to see all of the people that are incarcerated for cannabis to be let out
because it is uh really not cool in so many ways and that's really light language that I'm using
um that people who are in corporations are doing it legally uh and people who are incarcerated
were doing the same thing so I would like to see all cannabis incarcerated people let out and it
would be nice if they raised the hemp THC counts to make a delta 9 instead of total THC counts and
so we could have better medicine availability the world that would be nice too and I hope that
cannabis can change the world uh through teaching us so many things from seed to seed and I think
it's great that Denver decriminalized uh psychedelic yeah and I think that's really cool too
and and we really like nice people too so hopefully our community can continue to expand
and we can create together and we can be um communicating and we can be collaborative
in our efforts and moving forward we can protect our own seeds by putting them into public domain
to where we all can use them to where we can all actualize them and we could go on and on yeah
yeah definitely they're all fantastic suggestions and ideas so I guess to wrap it up do you guys
have any comments or shout outs you'd like to make uh the shout out we would like to make is
to the earth big shout out to the earth yeah for you know providing us a place to live and the
opportunity to speak together um thank you and this is an amazing opportunity to be able to share

making a difference in the world and shout out to people that are able to resist the corporate
takeover that's happening and shout out to seed breeders and shout out to all of the people that
are still cultivating um cannabis in an illegal situation we feel you we're with your brothers and
