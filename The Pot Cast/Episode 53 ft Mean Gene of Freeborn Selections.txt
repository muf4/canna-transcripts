We are joined by the meme master himself, the head honcho of Freeborn Selections.
You know him, you love him.
He's got the lime, he's got the cherry, Mean Gene of Mendocino, here to talk all things
breeding, history and so, so much more for a two-part epic.
So without further ado, let's get into it.
Alrighty, so a big thank you and welcome back for part two from the breeder extraordinaire,
meme master himself and the guy who I like to think of as the Elon Musk of cannabis,
Mean Gene, thanks so much for joining us today.
Hey man, thanks for having me.
Not a problem.
Glad to have you back for a part two.
Our fans have been very excited for this one to happen.
So the first thing I want to ask you, what are you currently smoking on?
Currently smoking on, let's see, right in front of me the latest stuff that I got, which
is not really that late.
I've had it sitting here for a little bit.
I got a really cool LA Confidential from my friend who does Tyler at Buds and Roses.
He gave me some of this LA Confidential.
He said it was a nice run and it's kind of cool.
I'd always wondered.
I heard that they use this thing they call the affee to breed that and it was really
interesting to get it because it's actually probably about the closest weed I can remember
seeing to what we call black affee up here, which makes me wonder if there's any relation
or if it's just that it's that good kind of darker coffee, Afghani type.
It's pretty common in California, Afghani.
So that's kind of out of the ordinary because it was a gift, but pretty stuff, really nice.
Yeah, that's an interesting strain because a lot of people talk about how that really
special affee mother you mentioned was replaced in subsequent releases of the LA Con with
something else.
I don't suppose you'd ever tried the subsequent releases that people weren't so impressed
by.
This one I assume just judging by what it looks like, I assume is the original one,
although I have really no ground to stand on on that except for saying that it really
has an old, old Cali Afghani look.
It's very similar to what I had that was the Hindu cross black affee back in the day
that I made.
The black affee itself was a little less resinous and then crossed with the Hindu kind of beefed
up the resin content.
This was like pulling out, they could have told me, oh, I kept some of those seeds and
I grew this out and I would have thought it was the same Hindu cross black affee.
So that was kind of cool, but I don't remember ever seeing anything from the later ones.
All I know is the first time I saw LA Confidential was at a point, that was 2007.
That would have been 2007 and I only remember because it was the first time I went to the
Emerald Cup when it was still a little event.
It was still at the Area 101 there.
My friend who has a company now called Giving Tree Genetics, which has really nice stuff,
he had it and he had just come back from Amsterdam and he was like, yeah, I got all the different
stuff over there and this was one of the nice things.
It's called LA Confidential and we had never heard of it, we had never heard of DNA, we
didn't really know anything about any seed company stuff other than Old Neville and Seed
Bank.
So he showed it to me and what I remember about that particular one was that it was
like a really sweet, fruity OG.
I was like, wow, this is fucking bomb.
It was really, really nice weed.
He had brought the seeds back and grown it himself and he's a really good grower from
down the road from here and kind of makes everything shine.
That was my first experience with it and so I kind of expected something like that when
I saw this and then to see how much it was like the Black Affie, that's why it kind of
made me think like, oh, so maybe that LA Affie was very similar to the Black Affie.
Wow, that's a cool little rundown on it all.
Something which has always piqued my interest, especially when I hear the term LA Affie and
Black Affie in general, it makes me wonder if this is the same sort of Affie which might
have gone into the creation of Urkel.
I just, at least whenever I hear Urkel, I always think Black Affie.
Is that sort of what you think or do you feel like they're kind of a bit different actually?
Well, I mean the way genetics work, it's really hard to be able to call that kind of stuff.
Somebody like an inspector at CSI would have a better idea of what's inside the gene pool
because of S1-ing that, because of selfing the Urkel.
What people I think don't know, there's a belief that a lot of people hold that if you
take something and you self it, you get a bunch more of the exact same plant.
But the reality is when you self something, it's the most extreme version of an inbreeding
you can do which will reveal anything recessive that can pop out and of course show you also
those dominant things that are in that plant.
So you get a picture of what the parents were and you even get a picture of what the grandparents
were and the great grandparents probably.
You know, he might have a better idea but I've kind of seen what he posts from it and
I've grown crosses of it and inbred those.
And I haven't seen anything that I would say is anything like what the Affie was that I
had, the black Affie, or what obviously is the Affie that's in this LA conf.
It has more sweetness and Urkel, the really really impressive thing about Urkel to me
was it has a kind of a rose oil and a lime peel and things I associate with like fruit
loops, Flintstones, vitamins, artificial flavor, candy things and a nice little dose of some
skunk on it which people don't think of it as but when you have really nice outdoor Urkel
it gets this little bit of skunk over the top of it.
And you know the Affie that I had was more of a earth, spice, licorice, incense and that's
the same deal with this LA conf.
So I would say that the Urkel, I wouldn't be surprised if it has something that's Afghani
in it because it's very short and stout and bushy.
It grows sideways almost faster than it wants to grow up.
And it gets nice big fat buds if you grow it right like an Afghani.
So I wouldn't be surprised if it has something like that in it.
I kind of, you know, this is on a tangent but when I was about nine years old I went
to lay it to this lady's house and this was when the movie Willow was brand new and I
watched the movie Willow there and when we were chilling there she pulled out some pounds
of weed and this was when I had only seen a little bit of dried weed really like and
had any interest in it because you're just at that age where you're not just a little
little kid and I looked at it and it was what she called the purple and it was more of a
red purple than a blue purple or a black purple and it was purple from the inside out and
it had this particular sweet smell and that was the first time I had ever seen weed that
was purple and so it had this impact in my head like whoa that's crazy there's weed that's
purple because to me it was always like oh pot it kind of smells like hippies burning sage and
it's green and then I saw this and I went huh it smells like sweetness and fruit and it is
purple so that was really really weird to me so I remembered it it's like probably the first weed
I really remember anything about as far as features besides it being some green shit in a
bag you know and so in about 94 or 95 a lady who's a really really close friend of mine who I consider
like my aunt who actually moved up from Santa Cruz when my mom was pregnant with me in in end
of 79 early 80 she moved up here and she had a place and when I was for freshman year I moved
up I lived with my sister for a while and then my sister moved and when she moved I still wanted to
stay in school because I didn't want to go back to Sonoma where I had been living for eighth grade
and so she was cool enough to say hey you can stay in my cabin so I stayed in her cabin and
she and her neighbor were growing this clone and she showed me the weed and offered me a little
bit of it and I said oh this is crazy purple I go as this is this thing from so-and-so and leg it
and she goes yeah I got it from the neighbor over here you know if you seen it before and I go yeah
I remember it from years ago when I was a little kid I remember this smell as soon as I smell it I
get this nostalgic smell so she had it at that point so not only did I see it when I was really
little but I saw it about five years six years later and it came from the same lady so it was
like the same thing you know it was a friend of friend of both of them are friends of my mom and
now when I smell urkel crosses cherry pie crosses granddaddy crosses things that are in the cherry
pie things that are in the gelato there's this common smell they all have even in a little bit
of the purple in my pina it's that same thing which I call the smell leg it purple because
that's where I originally saw it and from this one from this one particular lady now I'm fairly
convinced that whatever that clone was and I believe it was probably some kind of a killer
Afghani clone or something I think that clone was probably the mother of everything that people now
call like the perps smell like granddaddy all that different stuff and the only other stuff that I
ever saw different than that that had a real name on it that would give you any idea of origin was
the purple purple Nepal and I don't know that that was necessarily that was really Nepalese weed or
if somebody just thought that sounded exotic and slapped a name on it but long story short I think
because of being having that knee-jerk reaction of deja vu when I smell these smells and it's sending
me back to when I was young like that I think that that clone was probably where all these other
purple things came from because if you look at that and you go it was already something in 89
being grown by several people and by the time 95 came around it was still being grown you know a
little ways down the road not that far but far enough away from Leggett to Branscombe it had
to have circulated quite a bit and I saw 94 95 probably 95 for the last time and Urkel seems to
have surfaced about 96 in Redway so I personally think there's some connection there and I tried
to see if that clone was still around and the lady I still see her sometimes in the store and
she runs a she runs a little business down the road a little spa business probably not there
anymore unfortunately she said that she gave it to one person in Canada years ago and that he might
still have it and I haven't ever really checked back in on that but I I really think that that
was where all that shit came from and I couldn't tell you what that was but it is very different in
that the AFI is more of accurate sometimes has some garlicky nests to it it's more deep and
licorice sometimes but not like Jaeger or something and then it has like a resin where you think it's
not resinous but then you smoke it and it chokes you it's like it's coated in resin instead of
frosty whereas this old perp thing and the Urkel and all that it has a more visibly you know it's
resinous when you look at it it doesn't trick you you know so I think that there I think those are
kind of two things that are parallel and and unconnected just based on my experience with
both chimpals. Wow what a comprehensive sort of breakdown on the Afghani lineage and purple
strains in general I mean there's so many avenues we could go off in the first question that kind
of comes to mind to me is that sometimes when we hear these stories what kind of starts to pan out
from them is that rather than what I used to mistakenly believe in that we started out with
these really shitty clones and just through miracle you get that one in a million and it's
a bit better and then it gets a bit better it sounds almost like the opposite was true in a
way and that like the oldest stuff was possibly the best and sometimes it was retained in quality
each generation but sometimes it went down would you generally agree with that sort of logic or how
do you see it? I think you know if you go to places you know it's neat because you get to
kind of follow it a little bit with with some of the people now who share things like Deepak
what is it Erazin is that how you pronounce it? Yeah yeah it is. When you follow him around you
look and you can watch people take these fields of stuff that's hardly fed hardly
watered not really dried the way anybody you know who are our contemporaries would dry their
head stash but it's in the Sun you know it's maybe leaned up in a room it's put in huge piles it's
passed through and if you know anything about hash and you look at the resin that they produce in
these piles you go wow that's actually really good fucking resin and the quality of cannabis
comes from the resin it's not about whether or not you have a flower that looks a certain way
and you look at these places that are traditional producing countries and you know it's it's been
said for a long time that they don't have anything anymore all they have is a bunch of bastardized
European remakes of other stuff that was given back to them and their gene pools diluted but I
know the older original Afghani types because when I saw them here they were only had been bred maybe
two or three times and even if they had been hybridized with newer stuff those ones still pop
out and I look at stuff that he posts like right now from Kandahar and I'm like that is the same
we're growing like that is cherry pie that's cookies that's like the things that people think
are so modern they're there and they they're not really grow like you know I've grown things a lot
of different ways and when you just leave something you can have a clone of something
that's exceptional and if you just kind of put it out there and you barely water it you barely
feed it then it's you're just like yeah it is what it is but it's not it's not gonna look like
a crazy Instagram picture of some fucking quote-unquote Zaza you know and you you can look
at stuff he's posting from Kandahar right now and you go dude if you grew that indoor or in a debt
or just really took care of it and grew it outdoor like you would be looking at that and going fuck
is that what is that cherry pie or runts or gelato or all those things that people are like oh
these modern things are bullshit I'm like they honestly just seem like the old shit from back in
the day to me you know and then I was just talking to somebody today or yesterday and they were
talking about the old stuff that we had around here and growing up I always thought that it was
like so so long ago you know because it's like oh it's 95 and they're talking about 84 the import
from 84 or 81 or whatever and I was like well that's crazy that's the old-school stuff and now
that I'm not 15 years old anymore I'm like dude that's fucking yesterday the difference in breeding
if you import something in 84 and somebody makes seeds two or three times and then you see it in
the mid 90s like it's still the same fucking weed you're not gonna get that far doing enough
breedings just to make it be fresh seed because you know and back in the day people didn't just
make every make seed every year and try to improve it it's like they got some killer Afghani or
Pakistani they brought it here they made seeds they seeded a whole plant they groomed for a few
years and then they went you know what we should probably make seed again this year so by the time
you're seeing stuff it's only been displaced three three or four breedings at the most from 84 to
95 so my own opinion of how all that plays out is that some people in basically from the 60s to
the 90s really to the to the early 80s got their hands on things that were already killer they made
more seed they grew well they selected the females a couple times that were a little better or maybe
a lot better than the average and all of a sudden they have these really really knockout strains
that today are what we consider everything that's killer and then at the same time through all those
years people took things and they bred them the other way where they had something that was really
great and then they turned it mediocre because they thought man this is too stinky it doesn't
look crystally enough it you know it doesn't quite have the right thing that we're looking
for and they bred away from what actually made enjoyable killer weed in their pursuit to try to
make what they thought was what we'd should be but they had a weird idea of it you know and so I think
there was two directions I think they started with killer stuff they started with bad stuff some
people made the killer stuff more killer some people made the killer stuff less killer and some
people took the bad stuff and thought they made it killer and it just was like you know going in a
weird direction because they had these strange ideas like oh we need it to be stealth it can't
smell or we want it to look frosty but they didn't realize the resin was in the heads and not the
fucking stocks of the of the of the the trichomes or whatever you know so I mean that's my take on
it I don't think that what we call modern cannabis is nearly as far displaced from traditional
cannabis as people think it is I just think there's a lot of places where they had stuff
and they were happy with what it was and they kept having it and there was other places where
they had really crazy killer weed and they just kept it that way and different people over the
years wound up with these different different things from different places and some people
have the luck to get something from Kandahar or to car or like different places where there was
these really good things and that Mazari you know Mazar or other people you know got these other
things and they went oh this is you know Colombian and it's like yeah that's not actually the good
Colombian it's you know and then the name stick and it leads people on all these goose chases for
all this stuff but I think that all the best stuff is only a little bit different now than it was way
back I think if you had the best stuff in 1983 and you pulled it out now people would be like oh yeah
that's just as good as the best stuff is right now and then recombining things so so say you find
something like the black affey that doesn't look resinous but it's ultra potent and then you cross
it with something that looks very resinous and is ultra potent and you add the potency from the
one into the one that actually produces more resin and now you have more of what was already
ultra potent I think that's when you get something like og and sour and chem where you know you had
you had the luck of these combinations and I think that's what the modern stuff really stepped it up
to is going okay well you know and I think that's where the magic of breeding is is going okay we
have this thing imagine if it doesn't look resinous but it'll knock you on your ass imagine
if you can make that same resin be produced in larger amounts and then all of a sudden it's like
oh shit you know this is this this stuff's really crazy there's like a little level up I think we did
but I don't think it's what people think it was I think it's I think it's a overrated a lot as far
what what modern people did I think that the Afghani people and people in Pakistan Thailand
Vietnam and all these other places had already made stuff that by today's standards would be
really fucking good weed but um you know people rediscover it in these gene pools and they think
it's different because they did it now as opposed to that and that's you know that's my take on that
yeah what what a bunch of solid info there I think I'm looking as we speak at the eras and
post you talk about and God you're right some of these plants look almost exactly like cherry pie
and cookie sort of things it makes me think are you excited or interested in exploring some of
this stock that Deepak's found and if you were are there any of your own lines that you would
be interested in sort of melding together with some of these you know landrace Afghans yeah I'm
really interested um I've been looking at the stuff that he's collecting right now and Kandahar
and to me it looks like really what I've always been looking for when I was wondering like can
you still get real Afghani seeds and people would always say no everything's gone every everything
since after the Soviet invasion is bullshit it's all been brought in and everything's everything's
everything sucks now and I'm looking and you even look just using critical thinking you look at
these areas and you look at these people and you go so you think these these people really had these
thousands of years of tradition of holding these things and then someone showed up with some
and all of a sudden all their shit just turned to shit I just don't believe it and then you look at
the weed and you go they didn't have anything to bring from Russia or Amsterdam that would have
been this not to mention that even if they did if you're familiar with breeding with some of these
types these things are ultra dominant some of these Afghanis like these Afghanis could just
stomp on the outside genetics and turn themselves back into what they were to start with anyway
because they're that's how they behave in a gene pool you know they're like what I call the bullies
you know they just come in and they just bully everything you're like okay go ahead cross
something with deep chunk and see if you get something like what you crossed with you're
gonna have more deep chunk do that for a few years and you're just gonna be back to having
it again and I but I don't think that's the case I think I think it's the case that that there's a
lot of people who were isolated there and I think that a lot of people who went to try to rediscover
the old stuff went to little markets and they got bullshit tourist fucking seeds that weren't
really what was the real deal with the real people and the real people are probably pretty intimidating
if you're if you're not from there and they're probably pretty hard to approach and you have to
have people who who could really access the right people and the right areas and get in there you
know and so I think it's really crazy stuff and so I'm really excited to dig back into it and I
have stuff from him and a couple other people who have collected from over there like land race
legacy and Afghan selections and you know I'm gonna dig in there and see what's there and I'm
also excited about some of the other stuff that Deepak did which is like the the stuff like the
you know there's there's there's a couple other ones like the low lab and the and the mannipur
and a few other things because I look at him and I know the background on what I have a little bit
and then I look at these things and I go oh that seems like maybe there is some shared heritage
there and so you know that's a really cool way to reinvigorate things without adding something
that is really completely outside so I do have some plans to dig into those I think this coming
I'm gonna get into a lot of Afghanis and then a few other oddball things too and see what we can
pull out of those and then try to just get those out to a lot of different people you know so that
they can you know so you can keep the gene pool more diverse and and I think when I look at some
of the stuff it's like it has what people what people want and maybe if you do big big selections
from them you might be able to go okay well this is still without hybrid there's a thing that
everybody does they get their hands on some seeds and then they feel like they're they're gonna be
doing the wrong thing if they make more seeds pure like they're stealing and for me it's like and I'll
this right now just for anybody listening if anybody gets my seeds and they like them and
they want to make more seeds don't feel like you're stealing if you make more seeds that are
the exact same thing you don't always have to hybridize everything when you hybridize everything
then you lose what you started with so I try to put out things that are fairly true breeding so
that if somebody gets their hands on something they can make more pass them out they can get
you know they can they can get circulated and you still wind up having that preserved gene pool
that's that's not crossed with everything else and I always kind of cross things together with
certain goals but it's not just because I want to make it be different than what I started with if
I get something and I already really like what it is I want to make more of that pure to have and to
share and you know it can be considered unethical to make more of what someone had and then just sell
it because it's like you're kind of undermining people's business that they have but there's
nothing wrong with making more pure and handing those out and sharing them and all and all that
kind of stuff and I myself personally don't care if people make more of my same seeds pure and just
sell those I don't give a shit like I tell people to do it all the time like you know that is how
you keep having the same breed around and not have it go go funky because I've seen most of my favorite
things I've seen over the years they disappeared and somebody go oh I have that and I'll be like
oh yeah cool what it they're like well I crossed it with this and I'm like wow that's cool but it's
gonna take a lot of work to get back to where you started so like for me I want to take those things
make them pure hand those out and then take them and maybe work them into what I have at the same
time but I don't want to just always hybridize like hybridizing to me is just getting away from
from having what you already had that was good you know so I just want to throw that out there
because I notice it's what happens people get something for me and they're like yeah I made a
bunch of seeds and I'm like cool what'd you do and they're like well I put it on this I put it on
that I put it on that I'm like did you put it on a couple of the females of the same thing and
they're like oh no no I didn't want to I didn't want to be a biter and I'm like that's cool but
if somebody took my stuff and made more pure I'd almost rather have their selections back of the
same thing that they made different than I might have made it but from the same exact thing then
the new hybrids because as soon as you do that now you're back to a whole new process again you
know so that's that's my plan with those kind of land races I want to make more pure and then I'll
do some other stuff on the side too but I really want to circulate those things so we preserve them
because you've got to keep you've got to keep them around in their in their original state so that
you can have them because they're a huge part of our human heritage is our is our plant the
diversity of our plant varieties and when you lose those it's it's fucked up you know yeah sure and
I mean if we go back to something you mentioned a little earlier with the black Afi Hindu hybrid
you used in some of your crosses in the past do you have access to those genetics still and would
that be some of the stuff you might want to cross with these Afghanis well so here's what's
interesting I have a lot of seeds of the straight black Afi I have a lot of seeds of the Hindu cross
black Afi I have a lot of seeds of the Hindu cross black Afi cross Hindu back cross to the clone which
was what right now I would love to plant some of those plants had like this almost like a gardenia
to them but with like a coffee skunk at the same time to me like probably the best kind of stuff
that I ever made and that is really similar to what wound up making like root beer and Jaro
that's was the starting point was the Hindu cross black Afi but those seeds are still alive but not
viable enough to sprout so I've had a couple good leads on labs to be able to do real tissue
culture and I talked about it again and again and I'll keep on talking about it because that's what
we really all need is to get somebody who can take a couple cells living out of a seed turn
them into callus grow them into callus take those just like you do with mushroom mycelium take one
plate of callus make a hundred plates of callus and then start hitting them with hormones to get
roots and shoot so you can get plants to get back these original things and mine I know we're good
because as soon as they got to the point where they wouldn't quite sprout all the way I stuck
them in the fridge and I've checked on them and they're really good as far as being alive but they
don't have enough vigor to be able to grow as a normal plant and some of these things if you do
get them to pop up they pop up but then they don't have a marist M so they only they come up and they
have their seed leaves and the seed leaves open and there's nothing there and sometimes that
happens and you can leave them sitting there for two or three months and eventually they'll grow a
branch even from under the seed leaf or from the middle and it just takes a really really long time
and if they'll do that it's worth doing that with them but the ones I have will only get a tail and
then they'll Peter out and I can't get him to get past that point and so I'm not gonna waste them on
that but um I do have I do have like what I call root beer and what I call Jaro and if you plan a
lot of them then you do get the throwbacks that are like I have a clone right now that's a throwback
to the black affe Hindu and it's one of my favorites we smoked some fatties with my buddies
came by the other day not the other day now at this point it's a fucking time warp it was probably
a month ago but um we smoked it and after sitting there for a while we got about two-thirds through
the joint and everybody was like whoa this ain't normal weed like we we got a funny high right now
this is some different shit not to mention it's very tasty it's very hearty just really really
killer weed and so like it there is that and so I can take these killer Afghanis and breed with
those throws that are like that but there's a trippy thing in my brain where just because it's
the same plant the difference in in the actual makeup of the genetics and provenance and the
story and tracing it back like even though I know I can pull a fee Hindu out of Jaro I still want it
without the sour diesel and that in the PK in it and for me a lot of that is because people assume
that things like the root beer are killer only because they have the headband in them and the
Hollywood pure kush which are these famously potent killer plants but what people don't know
is that if you had just smoked the black affee crossed with the Hindu which kind of predates all
that other stuff and goes back to the 80s when you smoke that that was just as choky and you know
have the great high and all that the plants just didn't get as big and that's what led me to
hybridize them with these stretchier things that didn't water down the potency but they didn't
necessarily really add any potency it was already really really dank at the point just with the
so I do still want to get those back I'd rather work the pure affee and the affee Hindu with these
land races then pull out the plants that match the description but in reality aren't the same
thing and that's more it's more academic it's not going to be a different product and it's not even
going to be more practical but it's just a thing of being like oh this is pure this is the pure
shit it's a funny it's a funny thing in the brain where it just makes you makes you want that because
of the story and because of what you know it is and I think a lot of people kind of share that
enthusiasm for for like purity of lineage and provenance and and stuff like that it's a it's a
funny thing but I do want to dig in and do those things but in the meantime I'll definitely be
doing some hybrids with things that are the later crosses and I just released something that was the
what I call special indica crossed with it was a ghost og cross special indica across with special
indica and I gave out some of those for people to dig through and find those old affee types and
what I call big blue and you know but it just as soon as you put og and things it's like everybody
thinks it's good because it has og in it and then there's no way to there's no way to explain how
good the old stuff was when you've put og in it so like I really want to get back into the old old
ones so people can understand that better because they the old stuff really is as good as the new
but how do you tell people that when the old stuff doesn't exist it's all crossed with the
new stuff you know it's a funny a funny thing yeah certainly I think there's a lot of merit
to that idea you just referenced with people on this never-ending quest for the purest stuff and
I mean speaking of the purest stuff I don't think I've ever seen as much demand for any one particular
strain as what the public has for your root beer is there any chance people might ever see that in
pure form or are you looking to do crosses with it the thing about the the thing about the root
beer is that it's and this is this gets into a whole other a whole other thing so if you look
at growing weed in general for me when I grow weed the best way for me to do it is to take live soil
and put it outside under the Sun and I can grow you 500 pounds for probably $2,000 tops you know
what I mean Wow now people want to take and that's what I'm talking about like with overhead
you know of course I'm not gonna give it to you for that but if I was gonna do it I could do that
and people go to do that indoors and are already looking at huge power bills they're throwing away
piles of cocoa or rock wool in most cases not that people don't grow soil indoor a lot of people
also throw away their soil even if they do grow in soil I'm paying for all these foods they're
doing all this different stuff even when you're in greenhouses the level of issues you face with
pests humidity you're running dehumidifiers you're using supplemental lighting in some cases a huge
amount of stuff all basically to have something that people will be able to look at and go oh
wow that's fancy and it's kind of ironic because you're going to literally light the shit on fire
and throw it in a fucking ashtray which is probably about the dirtiest fucking thing in the world like
if I'm frying on mushrooms or acid and I look at an ashtray with dirty roaches in it and shit I'm
like that's that's the funkier shit but you're taking this thing and you want it to be the most
and shiny and frosty and it has to have all these all these things going on with it and all said
and done if you take something like root beer and you grow it indoor it doesn't even develop quite
the type of resin and funk that it does when you grow it outdoor something like Urkel even OG I
feel like is really good indoor there are certain things that really indoor they kind of live up to
their potential whereas outdoor they might be more potent and choky and have a little bit more
of a richness to the smoke and the flavor but they're they're different and they don't they
don't get they'll never get this kind of bag appeal where you open a pound of indoor Urkel
when it's done well is so special and a pound of outdoor Urkel while it's really special if you can
appreciate it it doesn't have the same impact and interesting profile that you get indoor so my
point I'm getting at is that root beer is interesting because it's only really fit the way I bred it to
be outdoor because I bred it outdoor and I selected it outdoor and it was the nastiest best most
practical thing to be a large plant outdoor and people when they buy seeds they generally want
to be able to put them indoor outdoor and adapt whatever it is and I understand that because
that's what's practical but root beer is a funny one because if I back cross to it endlessly and
make it just be straight root beer it's really unstable inside and in depth and people have
heard this again and again because I always fucking say it but I have this thing where I
almost don't even want to fucking get it ready to be indoor because I almost feel like if people are
that excited about it I should just leave it as outdoor so maybe people will grow some fucking
outdoor and realize the outdoor is chronic if you have the genetics that are really really good
outdoor and so I might release it as an outdoor seed I'm getting all the time I get a little bit
closer to not really wanting to have anything that is unreleased or that I keep to myself
but what's interesting is that it can seem all it can seem greedy for people to look and go okay well
you won't let it out because you just want to have it but there's a weird thing that happens
with value where like I've still never made anything off a root beer for myself but I've
probably been able to bring in I mean I don't want to put a number on it but there's been a lot a lot
of help and money that has gone to charity so far just by being able to leak out a little oh this is
this cross with root beer this is that cross with root beer and it's a weird thing because if I ever
release it for myself then that would undermine that because it doesn't bring in as much but it's
like it's almost better to leave it unreleased so that it can leak here and there as different
things that can be more helpful for people even though I can't do a charity for myself really
because I'm not that's not how that works but it's hard to give up that leverage of knowing
that you have something of value when it can be really helpful even if it's not helpful to
yourself because for me like I don't like I look at it and I go yeah I could just release it if
everybody has it I feel like pretty soon it won't be that like when cookies first came out you could
sell a clone for five grand or a tray of clones for five grand apiece and now people are like
cookies whatever maybe if it's the best pack of work something and you auction it off maybe you
get a few hundred bucks but it's still the same weed it was when it was five thousand a flat
root beer has that little bit of hype and following and all that it has this value and it has this
of people wanting it to where it makes that amount of money if I release it for myself
nobody's gonna pay $5,000 a pack but if I release it for charity for other people people will pay
way more than they pay for anything else I have so it's almost like if I let it out and I give it
to everybody I lose the ability to have that leverage with it for it to have the power it
has it's a weird it's a weird thing like because I didn't ever think I'd have anything worth shit
people didn't even want to grow my seeds in the 90s you know what I mean and I gave a lot of seeds
to people in the 90s who grew them and made a lot of money but a lot of people then was only four
or five people you know and now at this point people are like root beer root beer and there's
beer madness and I'm like well I can release it but it'll just be another thing everyone has like
cookies if I don't release it then it has this thing where it's like hey if somebody's really
fucked I can help them by putting out a little bit of something crossed with root beer so I'm
up in the air dude and I know it's a weird thing and the way my brain works is kind of like fucked
up because I overthink everything and I mean I'm sure you can hear the wheels turning just as I
talk about it but that that's kind of like how I look at it is like I want everybody to have it I
just want to release it and that way I know it's preserved and it's out there because it's really
it's really good weed like it's very enjoyable it makes you feel good it grows crazy it's fucking
gorgeous the plants they grow really fast and and all that so for outdoor I think it's really good
and I have like dude I have so many of the back cross three seeds now that I'm like okay this
would be a really cool one to put out but I just look at it to where it's like okay if you put
everything out then after a while because I do a lot of the charity stuff it's like it's almost
like well I would be able to benefit from it hugely but then I try to figure out well what do
I have that I could put in for this charity stuff that would still create this kind of a buzz and
this hype so it's fucking weird you know so I don't I don't know dude that's a huge run-on shit
which I'm totally probably at this point fucking known for like fucking Kevin Jodri or something
but you know it's my it's my take on it it's just it's a tricky it's a tricky thing this whole this
hoarding hoarding versus whoring thing you know you don't really know you don't really know what
to do with stuff when you have something popular I don't have a million popular things I have tons
of seeds but you see there's only interest really in certain things so I I always try to measure it
out and do the right shit and I don't fucking know it gets at a certain point it's tiresome
and I just want to be like dude everybody can have everything do whatever the fuck you want
with it and then I won't have to even think about it anymore you know but I also want to be like I
want to use the energy that's behind something to be the most helpful and not just to make a quick
buck you know it certainly does sound like it's a double-edged sword and I think the community has
seen a number of instances where you're trying to you know walk the line of as you so poetically
said hoarding versus whoring which is definitely my new catchphrase it's brilliant I love it so
for sort of the more aspiring breeders we might use root beer as an example because it's kind of
what I've noticed this with if someone did have some work that they had made and they were sort
of proud of I'd noticed that like with Ruby for example you had a bunch of projects already
finished you know in the bank ready to go and so you were kind of one step ahead in that regard and
then I noticed that there was a number of your sort of closer friends who had the root beer cut
do you feel like that might be a good sort of duality of like you're getting it out there enough
that people can hear about it and stimulate it some interest in it but at the same time it's not
you don't have to be too worried about giving that because you're kind of a few steps ahead
would you advocate for sort of an aspiring breeder who's made something and they're looking to get it
a bit more popular or a bit more notoriety do you think that's kind of a route in which they
could do that or how would you advise people so it's an interesting thing I mean I had that and
I smoked it for a long time and it was pretty unknown and I knew it was really really really
bomb because I would try to smoke other shit and I wind up just putting out the joint and rolling up
a lime one or a root beer you know and so I was like okay I know that it that it's really really
good and I gave it to a friend of mine and I said you know you'd probably really like this what had
happened was he had grown he had grown some of it crossed him and his brother had grown some of it
crossed with the with the chem dog special reserve and he was like man he goes you know I had high
hopes but it just it wasn't that great and I'm like dude you it must not have been a good cross
then try the clone you know and if you like it keep it for me so in case I lose it I can get it
back you know so I gave it to him and he grew it him and his brother and they were like yeah it's
fucking fire and he posted it and all of a sudden it was like everybody was like root beer root beer
root beer and I was like huh I guess it's a really good name and it's really got a pretty
color to it and it just it just kind of sparked imagination like you can't really predict what
will be what everybody really latches on to it's like people who make songs you know they make an
album and they go this is the hit and then it turns out this other song they thought was gonna
be you know it's gonna flop this turns out to be the one that really really is the hit and it
wasn't that I didn't think it was that it was really really killer weed it was just that it
was funny because no one had smoked the weed and they heard the name and they saw the picture and
it was popular it was the strangest thing to me because had they all smoked the weed I would
have understood that yeah you guys understand but it only took the name in the picture it's such a
fucking weird thing so like um it definitely is really really important that if you have something
that you want to popularize you can't be the only one with it unless you're already really really
well known and it was like this guy's account that was my friend Southern Humboldt Turk farm
he had an account that must have had 60,000 followers or something at the time or 40 or
something like that a lot and it was just like once he posted it and said it was really good
then all of a sudden it was really good and I was like wow that's crazy because I thought to
myself had it not been really good I think people would still think it's really good but I also
think that most people knew that if it wasn't good he wouldn't have said it was good you know
it's like you know him and his brother had killer shit his brother makes really really killer live
resin was one of the first people to have really crazy big fat jars of the of the best live live
resin figured out kind of the the tricks to get the turps to separate and everything that was a
little bit ahead of the curve and so I think people kind of there was like a level of trust
there and that helped but I think that you do have to be able to have things out there there's no way
you can just have it and say it's good and everybody will believe you of course some people
will believe you and of course people who know you in person and they've seen what you think is good
I got so I like to look at like if I know somebody and I know they only really like stuff that I like
as well because it's all up to preference but if that's the case and I'm like okay I got to see it
and then I'll believe it's killer just because they said it's really killer because I know we
agree on certain stuff but um you got to definitely let stuff out to an extent but like the root beer
has only been grown by Southern Humboldt turp farm and Southern Humboldt concentrates and skunk tech
and me nobody else has ever grown it and they've only grown it for one run apiece and for some
fucking reason the name the pictures it just got this mythology and it's really funny to me because
coincidentally it really is like my favorite weed to smoke along with the lime one but it doesn't
make any sense to me it's a really strange thing so you know like that was only a little bit of
circulation it's really really not it hasn't been out there and you know so I you know I'll tell you
straight up you can do whatever you want in life in general and you can try as hard as you want and
you can do all the right shit but if you don't have good fortune if if good fortune doesn't
fucking smile on you then it it doesn't fucking matter how hard you try but you got to try because
if you don't then if good fortune smiles on you you won't have shit just shit to fucking display
when the fucking when the sunshine hits you you know so you got to do your best but it's really
weird because I don't feel like you know I don't feel like everything that I did with you know
whatever fucking breed and root beer yeah it's killer it's it's great I mean it is it's not that
it's not but at the same time it none of it makes sense to me like it doesn't make sense to me that
people think I'm any kind of a person to listen to about what's good or that if I bread it and I
think it's the best like it's you know that fucking means anything you know it's really
trippy I just I think a lot of what works out for you has to do with whether or not you have
the luck of it happening where something gets a little bit of shine but you do have to do all
the work and you have to just keep trying trying trying trying different things different flavors
different crosses different moves sharing things with different people fucking just trying your
best to be okay and and you know being all right dude with some okay shit and then maybe something
takes off because you can listen to that right there with the root beer it's like what how is
it popular like you're like yeah it's it's this it's one of the most I'm like I don't fuck nobody's
even grown it nobody smoked it for some reason there's just this mythology sir that's why I
always joke there's there is no group here it's not a real thing it is it's real and it and I
have seed that actually you can grow them and they'll all fucking be root beer you know but
the facts don't really support the outcome like the even though everything even though we know
the weed is the shit the plant is the shit it's like but but how do people know that why did it
connect I have no idea dude it's just like people who make a hit song and they go I don't know we
made it and everybody latched on and fucking Jimi Hendrix made foxy lady and for some fucking reason
people thought that was a shit he didn't want to even fucking play it at least the root beer I like
it you know but um yeah but you you gotta you know you gotta shoot your shot and and do and do the
work and then you know everything else I think kind of fucking handles itself it all just pans
out to be what it is it's that's a weird that's a weird thing though I wanted to dig into that so
people really understand though it's not it's not about it's not all about just having perfectly
executed plans and all this it's just about trying trying trying trying doing your best doing your
best doing your best and then see what the fuck happens because you can't there's no recipe other
than trying your best trying your best is the is the master key to fucking anything working a little
bit you know interesting stuff sounds like there's some formulation out there and while we
may not know it that certainly seems like you know hard work good genetics and luck are certainly a
bit of a mix in there it's interesting if we just jump back to a question we spoke about a couple
questions back you mentioned how you know people will see headband or og in the mix of the listed
and then all the sudden it like gets them interested I was interested in asking you
I've noticed you tend to work a lot with both ghost og which I've seen in some of your more
recent crosses as well as with the Skywalker og which people will probably remember is a big part
of the skycut lakush would you say that these two are your favorite ogs and if you had to pick one
or the other what would be your absolute favorite og to work with within your projects okay so the
original my original experience with og which when I first got it I thought was the original og which
is fully not true it's not even a pure og but the Hollywood peer kush is the one that is the most
present in my work and that's because I got it before I had anything else and I think I got it
2004 2005 now that one is neat because you cross it with things and it doesn't cry baby organics
was talking about this on a post the other day there are certain plants that you use as a mother
where when you cross to them it it adds something without taking something away so for me using the
pure kush was interesting because it doesn't it doesn't it's not a bully you cross with it and
whatever male you hit it with most of your seeds come out smelling like the male side but in the
case of all the things that I used with it which were these squat indica's which tended to want to
get bud mold they didn't yield a lot in a large pot I was growing medical gardens where you could
only have 25 plants you want them to be as big as they can get it made things more rangy and it
didn't dilute their potency and in some cases it added to their potency depending on what you were
using and so that was the one that I used that was that was the prevalent one in my crosses now
something like skycutler kush I took Big Red put it on Hindu clone put it on pure kush then I put
it on Skywalker but I took that and I put it back on the pure kush again and I really like it the
thing about the pure kush is that it's a finicky plant and something like skycutler kush has so
much PK in it that if you grow it good and you know how to grow oh geez just like the pure kush
clone the pure kush clone if you grow it well you get these huge buds that are caked in resin that
are super dense that are super loud and when you smoke them you're like wow there's not anything
else it's literally the flower is more potent in your chest than most hash which I had never really
seen before that except maybe on the black lime or on the Hindu Afi which were both things that I
crossed to it to make what became lime one and what I called og coffee which was the father of
root beer and what I call jarro and so when you grow these things if you grow them right they're
amazing and you might not even know why you grew them right but they come out great you get these
huge plants with huge colas and they're fucking excellent and then people fuck them up and they
don't know how they fucked them up and I can't tell them how they fucked them up other than maybe
underwatering over watering like really hard for a few little rounds to where the metabolism of the
plant gets fucked up and then all of a sudden they have weed that's either larfy or light or
it's just not quite right and you're like well I don't really know what to tell you because when
you grow a normal soil mix and you don't fuck with anything they just have these plants that
they just throw down but if you fuck them up then you see that PK weirdness where all of a sudden
you're like oh man these just don't they're not doing what I want them to do so it's a it's a
weird thing that the PK brings to the table the PK also brings a certain level of instability to
the table which is the same deal if you grow them a certain way they're fine if you grow another way
once again which I can't really pin down it's like when I had the the Hindu the big red on the Hindu
on the PK I call it OG cuddler or red Hindu Kush because big red Hindu pure Kush people would grow
them grow them indoor they're all perfect grow them outdoor they're all perfect somebody grows
a pack indoor or outdoor the whole pack has fucking sexual instability you're like well
there's already been a whole bunch of these have been grown perfectly fine and now these ones they
freaked out so that's like OG crosses diesel crosses cookie crosses you'll talk to somebody
they'll go oh those seeds are shit they're all Hermes and then you'll talk to somebody else and
I agree with three or four packs they were all great so whatever it is that makes these things
freak out it makes them freak out but it's something that's coming from in the case of like
red Hindu Kush it was it was you know coming from that PK clone so the PK clone is this weird thing
because it either gives you the best thing ever or it gives you stuff that fucks up on you and
the nature of how I grow is so simple that I don't ever see that I don't ever have plants that are
fucking awful unless I grow something that's really outlandishly shitty and you just know
it's gonna be really bad because it's a weird fucking auto root or Alice or some shit that's
like the only things I can remember that were really bad but um but the PK is a trip like that
and that is the OG that really is the most prevalent in my work then the ghost I took the
sky Jaro which is Jaro so that's Hindu crossed with a black a female and I called that black
coffee at the time but that's a dead what I call the deadline it's not it's is not out there
anywhere so you know right now people like a bio vortex black dog crossed with coffee from
Kaya at green source gardens they have a black coffee I don't give a shit because my black
coffee is a deadline it's only been used in something that is later so I don't have a black
coffee I had a black coffee but I don't use that anymore so that's the Hindu the Afi on the Hindu
I crossed that with a Hollywood peer kush and then I put that on the sour diesel that made Jaro
I took that I put that on the Skywalker the Skywalker I really liked it was stretchy it was
vigorous it had the really clear OG smell different from the ghost where it was more chemical less
earth less skunk I liked it I like the shininess of it I like the vigor of it and then so I had
that I had the sky Jara I grew those those were killer they all came out like really nice OG and
some OG plants breed more OG and some breed less pure Kush is more transparent you don't get a lot
of OG from it you get a lot more what the male side was Skywalker I got a lot of OG from it
which leads me to believe it was more bottlenecked it was probably a s2 or s3 or something like that
so that made the sky Jaro I took that and I put that on the ghost because I had grown I had grown
the ghost s1 and they were really consistently all kind of an OG so it was like okay well I know that
the ghost is throwing a lot of OG whereas the PK wouldn't have done that the PK throws a lot more
stuff it throws some purples that are like lavender it throws these cotton candy type of
things it's really nice but it's not all OG the ghost growing the s1 cermet was like okay you get
a lot of the real OG so sky Jara was all OG basically with a little you know a little bit
different not not all the loudest and a little bit more vigor longer canes a little faster finishing
and then I put that on the ghost to make the ghost cross sky Jaro because everybody wanted
like a cush seed that would be vigorous and better than a OG clone as far as how it does in your
garden so so I did that and that was the ghost and then I also did the ghost with the lime pop
those came out really nice I like those a lot I handed them almost all out as testers and then I
lost the lime pop male so I had very few of the seeds left back to continue the line but I went
ahead and did that and this year I kept that going to the f2s but I gave them all almost all out as
testers so I figured if everybody grew them and they were great then I could take the lime pop
male I had as a clone and I could put it back on the ghost and I could produce those and that could
be one thing that I kind of had as one of my my staples because it was such nice weed when I grew
it outside inside it's a little bit unstable so it's gonna keep getting worked hopefully by f3 f4
I can have something that's nice and I'll put that back out but um the ghost is killer to me
it's the real heavy fucking og the real deal real OG kush Skywalker is a little bit more a little
bit lighter of a high a little bit bigger hardier of a plant I really like it it makes these really
big pretty seeds it's kind of neat and then the pk really brings a lot of potency and it breeds a
little bit more transparently which I really like because I'm most the time I'm not trying to breed
an og in seed form I'm trying to use what's good about the og and tack it on to what I already have
on the male side and so that's cool and the pk unlike a lot of ogs it drops hash a little bit
better because of its what's in it as opposed to where the og is fairly greasy it'll drop some hash
but the pk drops hash closer more like a bubba so that's the you know that's the reason for there
being a lot of pk is that was the first one I had and I believed it to be really old pure og based
on the way the weed was when I got it but later on kind of found out that it's not you know it
actually has other stuff in it Wow what a detailed breakdown of what sort of each of the ogs you work
is bringing to the table in your crosses since we last spoke it feels as though the backstories
behind the og kush itself have been fleshed out a fair bit more with TK origins kind of coming out
of the shadows and explaining his story the thing I wanted to ask you about was that a lot of people
might be aware that he speaks about how he was growing a strain called emerald triangle and he
suspects the male involved in the pollination was probably a Hindu kush when he was pushed to give
some sort of guess about what this emerald triangle strain was he frequently says probably some sort
of Hindu kush sort of thing and it makes me wonder could you believe that like or do you believe that
og kush is possibly just some sort of Hindu in cross if we are to if what TK origins says is
correct could you see that or do you have a suspicion that maybe there's some other genetics
in the mix okay so there's there's an interesting thing at play here that this is a this is a
multi-layered thing so the Hindu kush okay Hindu kush I've always kind of wondered about this Hindu
is a region within that region are tons of different micro regions where different strains
would have come from so I always wondered what is Hindu kush and there was a sacred seeds Hindu kush
that came out marketed as being skunky in the early 80s and there was originally Neville had a
this is where it's hard to kind of sift through originally Neville had a Northern Lights one and
a Northern Lights two I believe Greg McAllister says the further towards the one you go the pure
more pure the Afghani is and there's a trippy thing so Northern Lights one then would have
been just straight straight broadleaf gnarliness Northern Lights two would have been two based on
everybody's descriptions of what those were at the time now Neville had those originally he
marketed those I believe and this is this is info from seed banks that I have the catalogs and I've
read about him but this was brought up again by by my buddy not so dog and he pointed out something
which was pretty interesting that in one year Neville has Northern Lights with the description
Northern Lights two I think maybe one and in the following year now it is I believe sensei seeds
don't you know don't take that as the gospel because it could have still been his own thing
but I believe what happened was when he shifted his stock from seed bank to sensei seed bank the
names changed and so what was originally Northern Lights two and once again this is just how I
remember it and I never put too much into really remember in the details of it because I know I
can access that it changed from Northern Lights to being labeled as Hindu Kush so apparently there's
a Hindu Kush as a strain and like I said before it's a region so there would have really been a
lot of things but what we would have had in California labeled as Hindu Kush or Florida
labeled as Hindu Kush would have either been Hindu Kush from sacred seeds in like 83 or it would have
been Hindu Kush which was Northern Lights renamed as Hindu Kush by sensei seeds or by seed bank in
would have been more like 86 87 I believe now in terms of seeds the these timeframes these are
right next to each other you know like someone who got cookies in 2016 or 2013 and fucking cookies
you know but somebody who got those two things back then seems like it probably would have been
two different things because I don't think the Hindu Kush sacred seeds had is the same as the
Hindu Kush that Neville had I think Neville knew that this heavy Afghani type would have been from
the Hindu Kush region and instead of calling it Northern Lights because he at that point had had
the Northern Lights number five and stuff that was a little more of a hybrid type he had named the
ones that were closer to being a pure Afghani type as being Hindu Kush probably because Hindu
Kush sounds different than Afghani and Afghani number one was out at the time I believe so
anyway that is all to say that when I had my Northern Lights and I started breeding it in the
mid 90s originally before I had actually made seed I started seeing these ones that would pop
out in the compost pile when it would seed itself and the seeds would get thrown away that my my dad
at the time was every once in a while be like oops something got fucked up all right there's some
seeded stuff or it gets pulled out when it gets trimmed they get thrown in the compost pile now
George would have a plant in the compost pile pretty much every year and they'd be these really
nice things they'd be just pretty much like the clone but they were very indica they seemed a
little more broadleaf when you groom from seed than when they did from clone which I think is
kind of typical of plants in general the first big fan leaves that come up on an immature plant
before it sexes they really want to get big and chunky and fat because I think probably they're
trying to do their best to really get a fucking head start so I think the Northern Lights that
we had would have probably been like a Northern Lights 5 cross Northern Lights 2 or something the
plant itself to me was not what I would consider to be a pure broadleaf as a clone it was very very
similar looking to an OG Kush clone so when I made things like when I bred through the Jaro or Sky
Jaro etc I would look for these things that were like the Northern Lights we had and it was very
dark dark green the leaves they were shiny they would usually have five or seven leaflets never
more they had crazy the clone itself it had crazy amounts of resin on it it was resin that liked to
fall off like an Afghani the potency was just insane definitely right up there with something
like an OG or a Sour or a Chem and you know it kind of had this structure that was you know fairly
thin stem not what I would normally consider to be a straight Afghani but Afghanistan has a really
diverse gene pool I'm just saying that the Northern Lights we had wasn't like a Bubba now
something like a Bubba is exactly I mean almost impossible to tell the difference between good
Bubba and good Hindu which we had around here which we called Hindu Hindu and the guy who had
it the most around here was my buddy J-Law and J-Law he had this Hindu clone that he called Hindu
Hindu and it was fucking bomb and it was like Bubba but more visibly white and frosty it had
that same kind of a thing where it had this smell that was like coffee earth soap I don't know it's
a really trippy trippy thing almost had like a plant latex smell to it a little bit like like
when you break open like milkweed or dandelions or real cocaine which I personally have never done
but which I have seen in you know certain situations where people had it and I was curious
about what it looks like it just never was my thing I tasted it made me angry I never really
tried it again I had a toothache one time I put it on that real effective but it has something like
that that plant latex thing that's hard to describe and so anyway this is all just digging
in to kind of give an idea of a backstory of all this kind of stuff so also it really liked to drop
resin like my clone did but they were very different and then in about 2003 I would say my
buddy big L used to like to come up and grab weed from people in Mendo to take to LA and he would
buy the Hindu from the Hindu clone and he would sell it in LA as Bubba and he would get major
top dollar for it like unheard of shit but because it was Bubba and the people who wanted it knew
their shit but they still were like yeah this is Bubba but it wasn't Bubba it was Hindu the
backstory on the Hindu it turns out before J Lau got it it went to his buddy up there in Leggett
and the person who gave it to him it turns out was a friend of mine who was an older lady who's
probably about 65 70 really cool lady and she said she got it from a guy named Frank who had a heroin
problem who lived here where I live and that was around 84 or 85 now I believe that because it was
so long back she had actually mixed it up and it was probably a little bit later because I personally
think that she got it from Frank and that Frank probably got it from Neville once the Northern
Lights name had been changed to Hindu Kush in 86 or 87 or whatever now if you if you get something
30 some years ago it's really easy to think you got it 32 years ago instead of 34 years ago or 36
years ago instead of 39 years ago so I think that what we called Hindu Kush up here which is the
same as Bubba was probably from that seed bank release which was Northern Lights after it had
been changed to be called Hindu Kush and that Bubba Kush is almost the same thing and if you
hear the story that people tell about the earliest Bubba Kush they say they think it was a Northern
Lights cross and if you hear the description from Origins TK who I've talked with a lot because at
one point I almost wondered if the Emerald Triangle had been the clone that we had that my
mom popped because she popped it in 89 but he said that the Emerald Triangle they had had since
probably about 87 which would make it impossible that it was that clone and why would my crazy ass
think that it could have been our clone was only the fact that when I bred with things from OG and
I was looking for OG I had really good luck finding males that would throw OG by looking for
the same look as our Northern Lights clone but Northern Lights had been very consistent so I
wouldn't be surprised if what he's calling Hindu Kush is what is in fact Northern Lights and Neville
was taking Northern Lights and calling it Hindu Kush and what he used could have actually been
Northern Lights cross Northern Lights and that OG Kush could be Northern Lights cross Northern
Lights which I have been saying since long before his story ever popped up I've been saying that I
believed OG Kush to be some type of a cross of Northern Lights so I don't really know exactly
the real stories of whatever everything is the reason why I believe origins TK after talking to
was that he doesn't put any ego on it he doesn't say oh well I took it and I grew a thousand plants
and they were all pretty shitty but I found a crazy one and I did this and I did that he's like
I don't know dude I grew some shit there was like these couple seeds and then the fucking shit and
it just happened and all the stories that I've ever heard of the best stuff seem to come out of
stories like that that are a little bit more random a little bit less self-involved usually
if someone has an elaborate story that makes them look like a mastermind you know it kind of makes
you seem like you're probably full of shit and if you say that you just had a happy accident that's
seems to be kind of where stuff comes from more often than not and so that's why I I give his
story some airtime in my brain I've gone okay well let's see what that means if this means this and
that means that and all of the all of the details kind of add up and that's the reason why I go on
a big clusterfuck convoluted story of this and that and this so that you can kind of picture
how it looks in my head with my experience because it does all it does all make sense to an extent
and I'm like somebody needs to make a meme of me with a stupid face with the letters where it's
capital small case capital small case and it says everything and says Northern Lights is in
everything because I'm the dumbass who at this point does think that it isn't everything because
I believe that at some point cookies has Baba in it I believe that at some point OG has Hindu
and Northern Lights which it turns out are probably the same thing I think that sour
diesel has it I think chem D has Northern Lights in it somewhere and I have my Northern Lights oil
can which is the Hawken Afghani on our Northern Lights clone that crossed to the Northern Lights
several times and anybody who's had a lot of chem can smell what I'm pulling out of those seeds now
and without it seeming like it is chem because it has different it has different aspects to the kind
of the resin and the way the resin looks under a loop and all that I'd like to kind of I should
probably get it to somebody to gene test it like even though fire was full of shit they have they
probably have the bigger gene the bigger bigger database right now to look at genes it's very
there's a lot of what I call hot garbage that's like the chem D smell it's in there from that
Northern Lights and you know I don't know it's it's a really interesting thing but that but but
but with that whole story in my delusion at one point talking to origins TK I had been like well
Emerald Triangle shit I live in the Emerald Triangle late 80s who had clones in the late
80s I remember in 94 I brought a clone to my buddy OG foundations farms and most of the old-timers
from the neighborhood who had had dank shit starting all the way back in the 70s even the
60s going into the 80s when what we wound up getting from from those old-timers everybody
came to see what what does a plant look like from clone and this was 94 you know and it was a
Northern Lights clone and we had had it since 89 and my point to that is that most people had never
seen a clone I'd only ever seen two clones by the time I was 15 one maybe by the time I was 14
one was the purple one and leg it the other one was Northern Lights that my mom took and at that
point everybody else popped seed every every time because what a lot of people don't realize these
days is in those days you didn't have to have a bag of weed that was all one thing so you would
have a bag of weed and you would be like oh look there's a purple bud there's a green bud there's a
leafy bud there's a hard bud and those pounds that's how pounds looked all the way until 2002
or 2003 it didn't fucking matter until Urkel hit and then all of a sudden everything had to be all
one clone all in one bag the way people had been used to indoor all the way until that point you
only saw pounds that were all one thing if they were indoor and indoor all the way until 95 96 maybe
out right into their indoor was always worth less than outdoor because everybody got it and they're
like it's cool but you don't get high as long the flavors not as deep it doesn't look quite right
it's too bright it looks all white it doesn't have that real fucking look and so indoor was
like a bad thing all the way until the late 90s most people don't know that and the only time it
was different was maybe if you were in a place where there wasn't outdoor so weed was just weed
and if it was chronic it was chronic so you know people in the mid 90s of course who were buying
like indoor diesel or whatever it was yeah there you know they're buying that and it's in its super
high dollar ten twelve thousand dollar pounds on the east coast and shit but in California if weed
was worth 36 outdoor indoor was worth 32 it was always worth less to have indoor weed all the way
to a point and as soon as indoor really caught in caught on it was only a matter of time before
outdoor had to follow the indoor trend which was to be growing all one thing and having all one
thing in a bag and then all of a sudden that's how it was but back in the days it wasn't really
it wasn't really like that it was all just a mix in a bag you know so I don't know where the fuck
I went with this now I'm a fucking stoner trailing off but this is all true it's all true even
if I don't know what I'm talking about even when I even when I lie you know but no that's that's
amazing I mean you covered both you know the the OG the Northern Lights the Hindu the indoor outdoor
just so many things in that answer I think I've got to ask you a bunch of follow-ups on that but
I mean the first one is do you think that that change in like outdoor being worth more to suddenly
indoor being worth more do you think that was because of like rappers and people talking about
it and maybe even a growing focus on the aesthetics of the plant which I'm guessing maybe at the time
indoor started to out edge it or do you think it was other factors well so I mean I spaced out on
what I was talking about there but I realized what I was talking about was the reason why clone weed
from clones became popular right so the reason weed from clones became popular was because of
because of indoor and I think indoor became popular because people were growing from clones and so
when you got indoor at a certain point people were growing if they were growing indoor they were
growing a clone because indoor it was more sketchy to grow from seed because if you grew from seed
indoor they're all you might have different heights some of them might be unstable whatever
happened right but if you grew from a clone that was proven like that purple clone or that Northern
Lights clone then it was like okay now you have a predictable crop it'll all have it even canopy
it'll all finish the same day you know electricity is expensive you need to know exactly what you're
doing like indoor was a different game so clones started to have this advantage and so I think at a
certain point that's why clones became popular and then once that happened what people started
to realize was when you buy indoor the whole bag is the same fucking weed so if you really like a
pound of indoor diesel you like it and that is something you can get that's more like a branded
product whereas before it was like oh you want a soda here's a fucking soda but once indoor came in
it was like okay you want a coca-cola get a coca-cola but before that when you'd have your
your garden would be done and you'd be like oh oh there's that one all right go ahead and pull out a
little bit of that and swap it out with this right here because we want to stop that was the good one
you know and it wasn't like the stuff wasn't so particular and weedless were so much money that it
wasn't like in a lot of cases you couldn't you know years later it was like I started smoking
10 pounds a year or something you know because it was like you could just take whatever you want
and go okay we want this one this one do that separate but originally it was so valuable that
you'd be like all right well the odds and ends after all is said and done we'll put that aside
and if it weighs a quarter pound then maybe we can dig through the pounds and find the ones we
want and we'll take this stuff and we'll swap it back in and wind up with a quarter pound we really
want instead of the one we were left with but um but I think that part of what popularized indoor
was the fact that when people grew indoor it was all one thing and when you buy something and it's
more predictable I think that's kind of a value-added product where you're like okay well
you know it was cool to get a sack of weed great but then you're like I really like that one and
so the fact that people weren't doing that outdoor because outdoor people were growing off from seed
unless you were like the people who were getting clones from us back in the day who were growing
northern lights you know it's I think I think that had a big influence with being something that
you knew what you were getting exactly and I think indoor it's one thing outdoor it's mixed and I
think that had a big I think that had a big a big role in kind of dividing the markets and making
be something that was more sought after and then of course people figured out how to grow indoor
really well in mass believe it or not a lot of it I mean right now still a lot of indoor sucks don't
get me wrong and a lot of fucking outdoors a lot of outdoor sucks I'm not saying you know like
indoors worse than outdoor but in all the way through the 90s a lot of times if you saw indoor
it would be people would be like all right we need to get it out to get the next run and so
what does that mean it's cut a little early it's handled it's all green trimmed and handled a lot
so they can get it out the door it's dried a lot faster because we need to get rid of it and so
like at a certain point when people started doing connoisseur level indoor that really I think helped
to drive up the value of indoor and I think as funny as it is that that happened in places where
there was less weed faster because people valued it more highly and would have less and so would
handle it better and I think that's where like East Coast indoor being so fucking good in the
90s was the deal where the people who are on the East Coast who are the real connoisseurs
happen to be growing indoor and the people on the West Coast in the 90s who were the real connoisseurs
were growing outdoor and the people who were growing weed on the in the indoors on the West
Coast in the 90s were more were more concerned about it as a product and so we're kind of just
busting it out busting it out you know and I think that that kind of I think that kept it that
kept it not being as good of a thing and then when people started like okay let's really do really
nice indoor then then it stepped it up a lot you know and I think that's I think that's that's part
of the dynamic and that's not to say that's the answer to all of it but I those are those are
the things that I noticed and looking in you know retrospectively like the the difference and
how the East Coast had this really killer mid 90s indoor and I'm not saying that the people I know
didn't have it then it was just that in like 1993 you were almost better off saying if you have
really nice indoor just being like yeah this is killer this is killer outdoor and you'd get a
better price you know because people were used to it being that indoor in the derogatory sense
where you go dude it's just like not you know and I still see that kind of indoor from people where
I'm just like I don't really know what you did but you know and then the insane indoor that you see
that you're like this is the greatest weed on earth a lot of people have that but it would
typically be like the lady with one light or the lady with three lights or the dude with eight
lights or whatever and those would be the ones that you'd be like whoa holy shit like man and
that that was the stuff that did that you that you look at you go this should be worth more than
outdoor but because it wasn't the norm it didn't it didn't represent itself enough and so there was
like it's like you know kind of like a boutique market like people who know know they want these
three pounds from this lady that only has three pounds every two and a half months you know people
who know but at the same time if people are just looking for a bunch of indoor they're like yeah
my price is this for this and it's this for that you know outdoor is more valuable all the way until
at least the mid 90s for sure yeah I mean that totally makes sense the way you describe it it's
really interesting to hear how things kind of changed in the Emerald Triangle from outdoor
to indoor and I mean obviously outdoors still very possible and I love the little anecdote about you
know the old lady with the three lights I mean speaking of I'd love to if you're willing to
chat about some history from your mom if possible because when I talk to the real heads like Bodie
and mr. Bob Hemphill and stuff they always tell me they're like man you want to know a real OG of
the Emerald Triangle mean jeans mom she was laying some groundwork did she ever tell you any cool
stories about like you know bud from yesteryear that she was able to smoke or like sort of the
way she and her friends used to do things back in the day well so it's interesting you know my
my mom it my mom is not somebody who I would say is there's a there's a funny thing and I've kind
of addressed this a little bit because of people being full of shit and not really understanding
the reality of of things you know people go oh well you're you're fucking second generation so
you just had it all handed to you and blah blah blah and it's like just to break down the reality
of it is honestly my generation was the first ones and not even you know unfortunately not even me
but my generation was the first people who realized how to actually make money off a lead
my mom's generation was like they would grow a little bit and it was almost impossible to have
anything and if you know it was all a learning process so the deer would eat your crop the rip
would take your crop you know the neighbors would take your crop fucking your crop would be done and
someone would pull the fucking windows off your fucking house and take your crop you know my mom's
not somebody who's ever made any of her money like she didn't she's not like a big a big farmer who
made money off a weed and shit you know it's like she tried to survive working you know other jobs
and and and trying to have a couple plants so that maybe she could so that she could be a little bit
more normal in the country because here there's not there's not a lot of opportunity you know my
mom trimmed other people's weed my mom washed dishes she she opened the first recycling center
in this area and you know barely made a tiny bit of money off of that so you know that the the the
first gen or the first generation of people who were the real who were the real people who really
figured things out they they didn't get to really reap the rewards of all this shit so you know
when when people say like oh whatever you know your shit your parents were ballers and grew weed
and fuck you know they don't understand that there was no there was no coolness there was no
oh I grew weed I'm mr. cool I'm gonna have a brand I'm gonna look fancy I'm gonna be fucking
you know people are gonna kiss my ass cuz I got some fucking weed and all this shit that fucking
people come in carpetbag and trying to fucking do their little bullshit with you know shit was
rough it wasn't anything it wasn't anything that you would do because it's your dream and all this
fucking shit with these jokers you know it was basically survival and it was risking your ass
knowing that you might be fucking up and you might be you might be destroying your fucking
chances of having a good life by taking these risks but at the same time you're putting yourself
out there because you don't know what else to do and there really isn't anything else to do
because you live in a place where it's nice and you know it's safe for your kids because you're
in the country and you have a lot of different opportunities for the things that we as a species
do really well with but we as a society you know it wasn't really any of the stuff that most people
get the benefits of who live in places where things are nice it was the woods and you know
it's a trippy fucking thing so I got to throw that out there because of how people like to
perceive things and these people I'm talking about are not Bodhi and these guys because they understand
that they know they know what the fuck's up you know but um but the trippy thing is that my mom
the first thing I can remember her talking about that was really really standout was the was what
they called the Missouri which was weed from Mazar in Afghanistan and she said it was big big tall
fucking plants but then they budded with these huge fat fucking buds and it was just the most
gorgeous shit and they grew it in a creek bed out in Woodman Canyon and it had it had these big
these big beautiful buds on it that she said were just they had never seen anything like it and it
was just so fucking incredible and they grew it for a year or two this is like 84 85 or 85 86
and then in making the seeds at some point the wrong one got picked and my dad my stepdad who I
don't like to really call my stepdad but that's just for technicalities but my dad who I grew up
with my mom's boyfriend he said that at a certain point it just turned into lettuce weed and it
really wasn't anything that all of us all of a sudden was like well you can't grow this shit
and they lost it and they were super bummed and then he started growing what he got from his buddy
Charlie which was wahak in Afghani which he later gave to our buddy Ted who who passed away years
ago now and Ted ended up giving it to this other guy who was out there in the canyon and he was
the one Ted and his worker who is this other guy they would get clones from my mom which was the
Northern Lights all the way starting in like maybe 92 or 91 and they grew them and then he would grow
it and he would back cross it to his to his wahak in Afghani which he called the oil can and the
soil depending on what it smelled like and he back crossed and back crossed and back crossed
and that's what my buddy ended up taking and giving it to our other buddy who read it a couple
times gave it back and that's what we call POG or Northern Lights oil can and that's what that
that's what that actually comes out of so that's like tracing it back going back to whatever 87 or
something when George got that and then you know like my mom wasn't like a heavy smoker or anything
but I mean some of the special stuff I remember seeing was like when she took me up there to leg
it to that lady's house and I saw that purple and then you know the various things but really
after 89 the Northern Lights was like our workhouse plant our workhorse plant and that was what was
around all the way really until the mid 90s we moved to Hawaii we came back and it was still
around but I had some other stuff we were we were doing other stuff and then I thought it was gone
all the way to like 2004 2005 and then I talked to my buddy down in Healdsburg and he was like yeah
no we still got we still got those and I was like I want to get him back and then he brought him to
me and it turned out he thought I wanted the the dirt big bud and he didn't know that I wanted the
northern light so I got the dirt big but I seeded it and that's what the pina comes out of but he had
the northern light still at that point and I talked to him that was probably in maybe July or something
because I remember I seeded those plants they were still small when they were done so I had to be
fairly late in the year and then I ended up talking to him when he gave me those and telling
him you know I'd like to get those other ones like cool cool we'll figure it out and that winter down
in Sonoma County in Healdsburg the Russian River flooded and his buddy had a trailer where they
kept their moms and it was just a mom operation where they would get all their clones out of and
the whole fucking trailer washed away in the fucking flood down the Russian River and they
lost it all and that was so that was like the one real the one plant that my mom really kept
was gone at that point and she had already not had it for like 10 years but they had it and that was
just like this huge tragedy and to this day it's like every time someone says they have a northern
lights clone I'm always like oh well what's it look like because that's what I was getting into
when I trailed off and I forgot what I was talking about earlier was that the northern lights was
really one of the only things you would see around that was a clone and I saw the exact same clone
we'd come back from Chico I saw it come back from up further north it circulated a lot because back
then it was like oh if somebody wants clones they would get something that was already grown from
clone they knew was good indoor and then once people got those they would mother them up and
they would they would sell clones and so they kept it really limited because clone you know clone
cloning it wasn't really a popular thing to do and I know I know different people did kept a
couple clones all over because there's clones from the 90s but cloning became much more popular
in the 2000s than it when the late the late 90s than it was in the 80s and the early 90s so I
like think probably someone still must fucking have it out somewhere because it's such a good
plant but I've never been able to find it but that was like really my my mom's thing that she found
that was really really good and other than that you know really the only ones I can really remember
her talking about was that original Missouri and and then knowing that that Northern Lights and
she got that Northern Lights in a manila envelope that just said Northern Lights seed bank on it
and she got those in in in 89 when we lived where the area 101 where the Emerald Cup started now is
and then we moved and we had this little shed and she used to just have like you know a little a
little thing with like two 400 watt lights or something like that and it just basically kept
us from fucking starving you know so that that whole era was a lot different and some people
had the magic pieces of property where you wouldn't get busted and you could grow a lot of
weed and some people made a lot of money but it was hard and it was a completely different thing
than people think of it as and some people thought of good tricks and some people you know were able
to do shit my mom was a single mom she had two kids and you know her whole her whole thing was
just you know putting putting everything on the line to be able to do that shit she got busted
in 1982 with a couple small plants on the back porch because her roommate started a big argument
with the fucking landlord and the landlord called the cops because he knew there was weed and uh
you know she got locked up in 1982 and probably my earliest memory is driving behind with this lady
joey in the car looking at my mom waving at me from the back of a cop car on a fucking dirt road
you know so uh not you know not the uh not the glorious fucking hand me down um
you know type of uh lifestyle that people want to make it out to be when they just show up here to
try to fucking make a quick buck and during the fucking 215 year and then talk down on on on me
for being uh you know the dude who just fucking grew up with everything because i was from mendo
you know yeah wow what a powerful story about what moms will go through to follow passion and put food
on the table and you know major props to your mom for that and it's i guess yeah continuing on what
you said that's a bit of a bummer that people assume that just because you're second generation
that everything was given to you it's based on that story you could almost argue it's the opposite
like things are probably a bit harder in fact yeah well it's it's pretty what it is is it's
projection because they showed up and everything was easy as fuck and so they look at me and they
go oh well you know you things must have been so easy for you because you showed up even sooner
and i'm like yeah you showed up after the drug war had pretty much fucking disappeared for most people
and i showed up and turned fucking you know two years old my mom got arrested and four years old
fucking you know camp campaign against marijuana planting started and uh you know
it's a fucking real different thing you know i got buddies who you know used to used to go to school
you know or used to go to their house and i was like oh you know where's your dad like oh my dad
he's he's uh you know he's hiding in mexico or where's your dad oh he's gonna be in jail for
fucking couple years or you know fucking whatever it is you know like oh your pop had to had to
fucking log his property and he's still gonna do six years or whatever it is you know and then
dudes show up and fucking make a bunch of easy money and then wanna wanna top shit to to us like
we're the you know we had everything handed to us on a platter and i'm like you guys didn't even
you guys didn't even fucking earn earn shit they didn't make their bones doing shit they just
showed up carpetbagging and then talk a bunch of shit you know so yeah yeah totally that's a bummer
to hear and hopefully this can help shed some light on that sort of fallacy something i definitely
took away from that story that i thought was interesting was how you know this amazing northern
lights that your mum came across came from some seed stock from like a seed bank i think a lot of
people including myself in the past have made the mistake of assuming that all of this sort of
mythical strains and seeds that existed around that area in that time were like all from like
brothers of eternal love and all that sort of mythology do you think that trope kind of gets
played out a little too much and some of it is a bit less exciting in its origins and it's just
like good stock from a seed bank or do you think that the brothers of eternal love did in fact
contribute a lot to the genetics in the scene at that time i mean i assume they did i don't really
um i don't really know too much but i can tell you there's an interesting thing where we
i mean imagine back in the day we first got interested in weed it was the mid 90s me and
my buddies are like 14 or 15 right like as a parent i look at i look at you know kids i look
at my nine-year-old and i go yeah you tell them things but you don't tell them everything right
it's just a natural thing to be like yeah these stories aren't for you to walk around holding they
it might be kind of heavy especially in our day when things were still really considered criminal
and you know you don't you don't want to tell your kids like all this heavy duty shit that you know
they can't tell anybody you're like that that's just a disservice in a sense you know so talking
to my buddy um og foundation farms a while back he's he's telling me you know i'm talking to him
about like some different strains and he's like yeah you know i was talking to uh i was talking
to so and so and uh you know he was he was not well and i wanted to know some stories and he was
of that older generation and so i started kind of you know talking to him and digging a little bit
to try to you know just kind of learn more and knowing that now it's two grown grown men talking
and shit so he started opening up and saying more more of the stories and he ended up saying that
like things like what i call what i call uh dirt which is um which is an old afghani he's like yeah
you know well that came from that came from so and so uh the computer guy and we're like oh yeah
yeah yeah you know like back in the day they had told us oh he was the guy who brought the stuff
back and we knew that and and that had been told to us in the mid 90s he goes yeah but you know
what you guys didn't know because it's kind of crazy was that he also was one of the guys who
was letting them out in the back of the valley make a lot of acid back there my buddy was like
oh really and he goes yeah you know the the guys who did who did the sunshine acid they they used
to make a lot of that sunshine acid was done out there in the back of the valley like oh well that's
interesting you know he's telling them and he goes uh he goes yeah you know they they right then
around that time 84 or 83 or whatever you know whatever it was those seeds showed up and they
told kind of the ladies around here who were growing their like little yard patches and stuff
like hey grow this and and we'll give you twice what you're getting now for your other shit and
you'll have a lot more weed and it finishes really quick and that was kind of the introduction of
like the afghani like what we call dirt you know and uh so interestingly enough as much as i don't
want to be the guy who jumps on being like oh well the stuff i have it it came from all too like
so i guess it just turned out that really they did have a hand they kind of had their hand in a lot
of pies because it turned out that the computer guy had actually got his seed from bull and um
and that they had been they had been batching up sunshine back his place in the in the mid 80s
uh or the early 80s or whatever i don't know that the that the the acid and the i don't know the
time frame but that in the same area um was these things going on you know which was really
interesting and then he said yeah then we took we took these big things of seed and we put them
inside the tire of our car and we and we we filled up the tires and we we actually drove me and your
dad being my buddy's dad we drove to mexico and we took these seeds down there and that was the
year that mexican weed the price doubled on mexican weed too because all of a sudden it was
this chunky beautiful weed instead of being stringy and uh that was really interesting to me just to
hear you know these kind of trippy stories and if you talk to people in humble they have the same
kind of stories where you know whatever 78 they these guys got it and then 82 these guys got it
and you know as a younger person i would have thought oh that's a big span of time but now i
know like the course of six or eight years or whatever it's fucking nothing you know it's really
a trip so uh i can't downplay what they did because it turns out that even stuff that i i use came
came from them you know and uh i don't really think that that adds any value i think the
plants have their own value of whatever their value is you know um but uh i do think that um
you know i think there's certain it was a very very very small world and to this day it's still
a very small world as soon as you get before the internet i was talking to somebody today and he
goes man i had the sour cut in 2003 i got it out branscombe i never got another one like it
and i was like oh it's probably the same one we had because i think i got mine like 2004 or
something and it's a small area and there's not a lot of people and stuff and he goes oh do you
know so and so and i'm like yeah i grew up with his little brother you know and and he has some
killer you know sfv diesel seeds now and he's like oh yeah that's what he was talking about last time
i saw him and his brother must have continued it or whatever and i'm like yeah you know like it's
somebody drops a name and you're like yeah they i used to i i pulled my groin muscles
sledding down this hill when i hit a fucking stump under the snow you know like in 1980
1989 you know like that's my boy you know so it's it's it's trippy like the uh things really are a
small world so somebody like brotherhood of eternal love who brought in a lot of stuff
you know how many people were circulating it back then it was it was like almost like um it was
almost like you you might be ruining your life anytime you hand somebody some seeds or or a bag
of weed back then that might be it for you you might be doing 12 years you might be doing seven
years you know like you didn't fucking know back then it was it was sketchy as shit so the people
who were like that they were um they were pushing the boundaries they weren't normal fucking guys
now you can be a normal guy and have all kinds of different stuff and you know whatever it is what
it is and sure there's a risk factor there but you figure you could probably work it out back
then it was like no if you were in the 80s or the 90s it was like you you know that'd be like right
now if you're gonna oh i'm just gonna smuggle to japan that's like how it was just to fucking tell
people in california you had weed you know yeah wow different time different time indeed and all
of that really interesting stuff something that i kind of wonder about a bit is often you hear
about people reminiscing about strains that used to exist and maybe they don't exist anymore maybe
they exist just in sort of like an s1 of the original sort of thing and this all comes to
the foreground because you mentioned sour there for the longest time i've had the suspicion that
the fabled sour you hear people talk so fondly about particularly the east coast guys who you
know really just got swept up in the sour sort of fandom do you feel like the sour that they talk
about is that one still around or do you think they're just working with s1s or it's just a case
that you know back in the day it was the best there was and now there's better but they still
think like looking back that what they had was better like because you hear this sort of idea
expressed with a lot of strains do you think people lose the originals or it's just like
rose shaded glasses looking back no i think people have the originals but so many people don't and
think they're the originals that it's hard to make sense of what's what like i think that pip
from souvenir seeds because i've seen crosses that he made with his sour um i think he has the real
sour um there's a certain thing about it you smell it it's skunky it's gassy it's got a thing to it
that's like that that's it you know like you just know that's it it's um it's so much like the super
skunk that you just kind of know like uh it that's fucking sour and then you see a lot of people sour
and you go yeah you know that just doesn't have it and then there's even ones that are not like
i haven't seen his sour i've just seen what came from it but i can still tell it came from the real
sour because it's just too it's so much more sour than everything people think is really sour and
it's a cross you know you're like all right well this guy has you know even if it wasn't even if
it wasn't the exact plant the phenotype of it it's like that's it you know what i mean like it's it's
got to be it it's like if uh i don't know i just it's just it it's just the weed you know it's it's
it's skunky ass weed and it um and that's really what it should be like like the real real sour
stuff that i originally had it was skunky and metallic and earthy and it smelled like coffee
and it smelled like super skunk and it has like this cushiness to it that's not
og but the same thing you like about og it has some of that and it drops resin and
um it gets you high immediately and you feel it in your head and it tastes a certain way
and um there's just certain there's certain things that sour is you know and then there's
certain things that not sour are where you're just like that's just not sour you know and um
i think it's a type of weed and in my opinion if you can find the exact same type of weed i really
don't give a shit if it's the same plant or not if it's the same type of weed what do we care
you know what i mean like not to say that um not to downplay provenance and all that like i i care
about it myself but like the reality of all of it is is like what's in your bag the reason why i want
these particular plants is because they really are that kind of weed and if you get a plant and
someone says it's sour and you grow it and you don't wind up with that weed that you expected
and you know what that really is it's different then it's different but even if the clone was
different than what it was supposed to be and it's actually a one-off or an s1 or a cross or
whatever for the sake of having the weed it's the same fucking weed you got it right there the only
thing that's different that's the same that's that's you know phenotype and that's you know
bulk phenotype or gross phenotype where it's like they that that all that it's all the one thing
even if it's a different plant and then you know genotype wise it's like well if it breeds
different then it's different um so it's a different genotype but it's the same phenotype
um that's like a weird that's where you start to get into that funny genotype phenotype confusion
where people don't know what's what it's like well you can have the same phenotype and go it's sour
this is sour that's sour now if you s1 both of those plants that are both exactly like sour and
one throws a bunch of shit that's not sour and the other throws all sour that's where you have
your different genotype you know that's where it actually counts in the conversation as far as
people like cloning something and being like oh don't call it a phenotype call it a genotype it's
like well every plant is a genotype and a phenotype but what are we talking about here because you
might not be even talking about something where you need to even use those words just call it a
fucking plant or a type or a throw or you know what i mean but that's that's where it really
comes down to it for me is like if i want to smoke it i only need the phenotype but if i'm going to
breed it and say it's the original and i'm and and and that's what's going to get preserved and
that's what's going to get spread and you know the provenance and all that that's when you need
that genotype it needs to be what's inside of it that it actually possesses for its progeny
that's when genotype counts you know and uh so you know like i said it is it is it really do
people really have it i don't know but if people have it and it really breeds that way where
things come out of it that are the real deal like that's all you really need um but you know i mean
the coolest thing is if you know like somebody's like yeah i popped the seed and this is the real
one it's always been in my hands and you know but um other than that there's really no way
to verify a cut without having it without being able to go i gave it to so and so they never got
another thing similar to it they gave it to so and so that person never got another thing similar
to it they gave it to this guy he never had something similar to it then you can get it back
and know it's that but if you gave a sour if you popped the sour from seed and you gave it to this
guy and he's like yeah i had it and then i bred it and i kept this one and it was like sour but
it was even bigger so i kept that one but i kept the original but then at one point i think i mixed
them up like you've already lost it you've lost your provenance and you don't really know you
don't really know shit because you could have a plant that the phenotype's exactly the same
but it ain't actually the same genotype because a different fucking plant you know so um yeah i
don't know it's all it's all it's all an interesting interesting thing the whole sour thing
because there's so many sour cuts and then was the one i got in the early 2000s was it ever the real
one i don't know but it's what i consider the real one and when i see people with something
that's like that or that has tons of that super skunk smell that i knew from the super skunk that
my buddy got from his buddy's back because he had it before and then he got it back from his
buddies in arcada in the late 90s that's the super skunk i know to be skunky and i don't even know
is that the super skunk that that everyone else is talking about when they talk about the the mass or
the the six or i don't fucking know i just know that's the one that i know and when i smell really
good diesel if it smells like that then i think of it as being real diesel you know and that's
what the la kush headband that's what the real sour they have that smell from that super skunk
and the difference between them and super skunk is super skunk tasted great smelled great wasn't
really that gnarly a weed but it was really tasty and enjoyable the real good headband and sour were
like the sour would get you really high and it was clear the headband would just fuck you up like you
could get really high off of that weed if you didn't have a real strong tolerance to those
kinds of weed and you know those are those are the cool ones to me
hell yeah that's interesting you you bring all that up because i mean a lot of it obviously
really valid points and on the topic of like strains that people may or may not have and you
referenced the skunk in there i noticed on a recent csi humboldt post of all things seeing
as we've already referenced old inspector um that there was a post about roadkill skunk and i noticed
a comment you left there saying that the skunkiest thing you had smelt in a while was a strain called
death coast and i actually hadn't come across that one at all can you tell me a little bit about that
so that's one that comes from those seeds that um that uh souvenir seeds made and um you know i grew
it i have my what i call grape lime skunk which i'm not gonna say is roadkill skunk but that's the
one that like um you know like i don't not to like just put it out there just like as a as a name drop
but like skunk va had the skunk back in the day for a long time grew it knew what it was
and he said that the grape lime skunk had that smell in it with other smells of course which is
what i think too but that it was the closest he'd smell since he had smelled that stuff in the 90s
and um so i had that i had a cut that is supposed to be death star whether it is or not i don't know
but it's very very skunky um i had sour diesel cut i had some sour diesel bat cross twos that
i got from skunk tech that were popped from karma seeds i had um some other stuff you know some
pretty funky stuff and breaking down taking the seeds out of the death coast was like burnt garlic
burnt rubber coffee onion skunk just funky super skunk as much as i can remember it just smelled
like super skunk to me like what i called what like what i called pissy pungent back in the day
um but a little different but like really really what i know to be what i ever smelled that was
what i ever thought was the skunkiest weed you know um and so that i believe was a death star
cross sour diesel or it might have been a sensi star cross sour diesel a remake of the death star
cross but it's one of those and um it was nasty and then i got some weed from from the same guy
and it was what he calls rubber city and the rubber city i believe is the death star cross
with the sour i think the death coast is the sour cross sensi star so the rubber city i think is
three quarters sour and the and the death coast is half but i'm not sure about that but that's
that's how i remember it i don't know it might be the opposite but um it's it's uh it's just it's
it's skunky like it's just the skunkiest shit like if you want skunky stuff and i i haven't
um i don't know i haven't seen other stuff that i that i would say really
smells like skunk and i haven't grown everybody's so-called skunk but when i ask people when they're
growing it out kind of everybody's like oh so-and-so said it's skunky it's not skunky
and i'm like okay well there there you go they said it's not skunky like you seen
you know csi on that he's like i don't know if there's a way to make them skunky
but they ain't skunky so i don't you know i don't really know um you know i don't know what to make
of all that but uh but that that stuff is that's bomb like i would recommend if people want something
skunky get those and then i think people have this weird thing of of wanting like something to appear
that's gonna be like literally smell like a dead skunk and i just don't know i've seen thousands
and thousands of plants and from back in the day when skunk was really common we didn't even really
think much of it and i didn't ever really smell anything that was more like a dead skunk than like
super skunk or death coast or you know like this grape lime skunk thing that i have which i would
say is is way not as skunky as death coast but which is it has another little dimension to it
which is kind of this wet dog um coffee thing that i get from when i smell a real skunk spray like i
had a house where there was a there was a place where like some some wiring got off of one of the
holes and i had a skunk go under my house and spray my house twice so like i'm very familiar
with a fucking skunk you know what i mean i've i've been in a car that went over a skunk that
was an old car that was pretty rickety and it sprayed us directly under the car and like your
eyes burn and there's certain smells and like those particular smells there's these certain
aspects um and mine i wouldn't say is the intense like dead skunk like that but it it has some it
has those things that i think make up um that smell but i'm still i'm still not like this is
the fucking roadkill skunk i don't even know what that is i never saw anything called roadkill skunk
in the 90s i saw a lot of fucking weed but i didn't see everything um but i you know i i question a
little bit this whole uh i question the whole you know hunt for it a little bit and think that um
weed smells a lot skunkier to you when you don't have very much weed you know
yeah definitely definitely i mean there's a lot of a lot of different angles we could work that
one from but i'm glad you brought it up that the uh the grape lime skunk of yours i remember
still to this day you know being at emerald cup and you gave me that bud to smell and i took it
over to skunk va and we both immediately agreed that was the most insane skunk turds we'd ever
smelt in a long time do you have any plans to try to lock that one down in seed form at all i mean
whether it be just you know to do the f1s which was what i kind of smelt or to line work it to
back cross or anything sort of like that up your sleeve well so i had that one and it was funny
because i only had one plant of it and it was this gorgeous plant so i ran through a bunch more
and uh i found some nice ones so i let out a little bit of f2s of those from a nice grape skunky one
with a lot of the grape funk to it and then from those same males that i pulled out of those
um i put those back on the lime one and i put out a little bit of that as line one back cross
because it was line one cross grape soda skunk was what the grape lime skunk
clone was that you smelled so i took its brother and put that back on two twin brothers actually
and put that back on the line one um for line one back cross so that wasn't so much shooting
for the skunk side as it was shooting for more of the lime um and then i did
uh i made f3s with everything that i got that was real stable out of those so i think there's maybe
eight of those uh three different males done separately in that breeding one of them that
was just very loud skunk plant the whole plant just smelled really really skunky
um two more that smelled a little bit more like the original grape lime skunk clone that you saw
so i took that original grape lime skunk clone that you saw i crossed it with
three different males separately so there's three different lines back crossed
i made f3s with three different males separately so there's um i guess maybe there's 10 lines of
it in f3 now eight of which are with my favorite male two of which are with the
the females that matched the other two males i kept most closely um and that's just an attempt
to do that and i gave those actually to skunk va because he said he'd pop them and i know he
knows skunk turps um so you know we'll see if he finds anything and uh you know if he doesn't cool
and if he does right on and um i had the f2s i had a lot of them everything that didn't smell
where the whole plant didn't smell like a skunk i gave them to one of my buddies and he put them
in like 200 gallon pots and i think i gave him 30 of them maybe 25 and i went out and checked on
them when they were really chunky and some of them had butt some colas that were like damn near like
loaves of bread you know they were huge fucking colas where you're like that's got to be rotten
but they weren't because it just has really the grape and the lime both have great mold resistance
because they're based on old gorilla strains you know and um out of those 25 that i thought
wouldn't be skunky there were probably five or seven that were like really skunky like
whoo shit that's skunky bud you know and um then out of the ones that i kept that were the ones
that i really liked the most which i think was 10 of them out of mine was the same deal probably the
same only the same ratio which means that the whole plant smelling like a skunk doesn't necessarily
determine whether or not the flower is going to smell like a skunk that's kind of shit to keep
track of because some strains the stem rub means a lot and some it means less so um that means that
just because the males i kept were skunky doesn't mean they'll necessarily throw skunk
but i back cross now to the one you smelled and then i'll plant that and out of those i'll find
something that's the closest to it and i'll back cross to it again and what i'd like to see is that
the back cross has more of that plant in it than the f2s and if it doesn't then i'll try another
back cross but if it doesn't increase at that point then it's kind of an indication that that
plant doesn't like to breed true um it could also mean that i'm just not picking the right males
um but it's pretty you know like you want to see when you back cross to something that the
frequency of that type goes up fast and if it doesn't then it makes you know that you're probably
better off going f2 f3 f4 rather than going back on a back cross um so you know that's my
experimentation with it at this point people are growing out the back cross people are growing out
the f3s um and you know we'll see what works out of it and the cool thing is i have the clone you
know so i have a plant that smells like that weed i just uh you know i'd like to see it in seed form
i'm not going to take that i'm not going to take that and say oh yeah you only have to grow six
six fucking uh packs to get one that smells like this and then put skunk on the label that's like
doesn't make any sense i'll call i can call it grape lime skunk you need a grape lime and skunk
but um you know if it can get to the point where it's skunky skunky that would be that would be
cool and then i took that too and i crossed it with a death star because the death star was
really skunky almost as skunky as the death coast and uh out of that there might be more skunk but
for me i feel like that's cheating a little bit because it's using super skunk from the diesel
and i what i want to do is bring skunk out of the old um afghani stuff that's in the grape in the
lime um just it's more of a kind of like a challenge uh but in the meantime i don't mind
doing doing a cheat and just seeing if that will make it work too you know because they both if
they both have it coming from both sides you might get a lot more of it should get a quarter
taking two two things that have it in there um but that's not necessarily true because it might
not be frequent at all in the gene pool but we'll find out so that's the that's the uh
um that's where i went with that this time sure and i mean a question which kind of stems off what
you were just talking about but i'll make it a little more hypothetical so that hopefully it
makes it easier to answer let's just say someone out there who's listening has managed to find
themselves uh they've made a cross and they've pheno hunted the seeds and they find one plant
in those seeds which is totally unlike the mother or the father you know like let's say mom's mango
dad's og it's blueberry you know like it's just really left of field to both parents and you you
really not sure what traits are coming from what parent because it's just that really unique sort
of phenotype oh would would you try to line work that or back cross it like how would you go about
trying to lock in that super super unique phenotype would it be trial and error or do you think for
those super like one in a thousand phenos it's probably actually not very easy to get that into
then a seed form well some people won't like to hear it but the way that you really want to do
things like that is you want to take that blueberry plant and self it find the same exact
plant again even if it was out of one out of a thousand when you self it it should be a little
more frequent than one out of a thousand then you want to grow those out find the plant that's the
same again and if you have to self that one again every time you self you're going to lock it down
more and more and then you know you can take that blueberry plant and take a male out of the same
cross and go and and and breed to that and you know make your make your f3 and then take your f3
male that you think is the closest to the blueberry plant put it back on the blueberry and then hope
you get some blueberries out of that and then out of those seeds find the one that's the closest
once again and go back and then if you see that you're starting to get more blueberries every time
you can just continue black you can continue back crossing to the blueberry you know until you want
until it winds up being you know really frequent and you just get a lot of blueberry in there
then at that point would be where it would be better to breed it forward because you you you
you're basically targeting in you know you're getting it to the point where there's more and
more and more of this one thing that you want um and then you know if that if that didn't work at
all then like i said you know selfing it is really the best way because if you get one out of a
thousand is blueberry then you self it and you get one out of whatever that next time but you find
that one out of the s1s and you self that one and you find that same one out of the s2 by the time
you make the s3 or the s4 you're going to have something where that's what it has they're just
mostly all blueberry right so then at that point you might be better off crossing to the s3 or the
s2 or the s1 you might be better back crossing to that lots of times because it might be a lot more
um true breeding you know and uh you know there's just a question of finding those those right
things and i mean as far as like modern breeders would look for they'd look for whatever those
genes are and just go okay we're just going to test this plant and see if it's the right one
test a thousand males and find the one that actually has those same genes and that's how
you would do it if you were like a real um you know a real breeder in the in the most advanced
sense of of the of the of the you know discipline or the job um but you know in reality if you were
somebody like if you were big agriculture and you want this crop to get ready and you want to be
able to go okay we're going to get this into seed form as quick as possible you would self self self
self self so you would you would you would make the s1 then you would find the exact same plant
maybe improved ideally definitely you don't want to settle for one that's not you don't want to
settle for one that's worse and then you want to take that s1 and you want to self it and then you
want to find one of the s2s that maybe is a little bit improved or maybe a lot improved if you can
and then you want to make the s3 and then you know by the time you get something to be in like
you know five generations seven generations of selfing that's what they're really talking about
when they tell you about a true inbred line there's different ways to to to define an inbred
line or an ibl but like in a most true true sense it would be like selfing for several generations
and then you could get to the point where you basically had clone in seed form where the plant
would be exactly the same now if you just back cross seven times and the plant you were back
crossing to doesn't ever want to be super it doesn't want to be the only thing in the mix
anyway because it already has a it's coming from a diverse gene pool then you sometimes will make
it work but it's more likely that you won't and you'll wind what you'll wind up with is the same
gene pool that came from just coming back again and again as if it's an s1 because s1s aren't
really consistent back crosses aren't necessarily consistent s1s are very consistent if they came
out if that you take an s1 out of something that's already super consistent yeah then you get what
people think an s1 is but that's not the case when you when you s1 something from a really
inconsistent gene pool or where you back cross to one plant from a really inconsistent gene pool
unless you get lucky and all the traits that you wanted from that plant happen to be dominant and
then it doesn't matter if it was inconsistent because dominant traits are just going to want
to pop out frequently you know more than other stuff but you have to kind of you have to kind
of play with them to know exactly what the individual is you're working with to know
if it's just gonna throw everything you want like you might back cross back cross back cross
and then turns out well now you've just made a super consistent strain but it has one thing locked
in you can't get rid of like it's sexually unstable or it's prone to a disease you hadn't
even maybe you didn't even have that disease and now you get it you go fuck the whole population
gets it whereas that the s1s from that plant might not even have that because you still had
some variety so like you know i don't know there's there's a lot of different a lot of different ways
to go with it and that's what's so trippy about anytime you want to work with something is you
don't you don't necessarily know what's the best way to do it um without trying so that's why it's
really good if you're going to work with things to work with things you really like because if
you're going to wind up having a lot of failures you want to have failures on your way to something
that means something instead of having a bunch of failures on your way to something where even if it
works perfect you don't even you don't not even evaluate that much you know so i work with your
favorite stuff so if you fuck up or you waste time or you do the wrong thing and now you have to start
over you're still excited you know because if you just follow in whatever you're trying to chase
you're trying to make rks because rks is hot right now you know you know let rks pop up for
10 years and see if it stays popular after a while people are going yeah it's good but it's you know
it's actually not really i mean and then in back in the day a lot of stuff was skunky and we didn't
even we weren't even that excited about it unless it was like what i said like the pissy pungent or
the the super skunk where it actually smokes good and translates just smelling like a skunk not
necessarily anything it doesn't you know the weed also has to be enjoyable and have a good high and
taste good and burn right and hopefully grow good and yield well and you know like i like what is
rks rosin tastes like it might fucking taste like nothing nobody even knows there's a whole new
generation of uh of uses for stuff so um you know make sure you like something before you go fucking
chasing it because everyone's talking about it and there you have a gang what a great first half of
