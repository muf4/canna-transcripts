Let's get into it. Alrighty friends a big thank you and
welcome to the next guest on the show, the CEO of always be flowering, thanks so
very much to Ghost for coming on. Appreciate it man, thanks for having me
on here. Not a problem my friend, so first question we ask people these days, what
are you currently smoking on? Right now we're smoking on some PK Sherb that we
made, so it's the Malibu PK with the reverse sunset sherbert and before that
some tricks by my buddy Grow Low Key, GG4 Mendo Breath that he hunted. Wow
interesting, there's a lot going on there, so I mean first of all tell us
about the sunset sherb, how would you describe the crosses you made with that
one? I'd say the sunset sherb crosses have all been pretty beneficial in terms
of what it added to the structure, it's a really interesting plant, probably the
plant that I've been most excited about since cookies and I actually passed on
it for a couple of years because I wasn't interested in hearing anything
about it, mostly because I didn't really think that it would be better than the
cookies in any way shape or form, it just seemed kind of like derivative, so I
passed on it for a while until I actually got to try a sample and I was
impressed by it, it's got the creamy kind of deep musky flavor and it's a little
bit less cookie doughy dominant and I like the yield on it, the structure on it,
the growth habit, super super proper plant in terms of how it grows and
stretches and the yields from it, I'd say you know it's probably added a lot
to the crosses and with the PK being lower yielding, a little bit more finicky
of a plant, you find that what the crosses of it produce are hardier more
vigorous plants. Yeah that sounds really good and I've got to admit I've actually
never tried pure sherbet, that's why I'm always interested to hear people's take
on it, but to cross over the other side of things, you mentioned you crossed it
to the the pure kush, I'm always interested because there's so many
different pure kushes, is the Malibu your personal favorite one? So I honestly
think that a lot of them are very very similar if not identical, I think
sometimes when people see them, all they're really seeing is just
different growers examples of a similar plant, at this point with the OGs in
general, which I'm sure you've seen a good amount when you've been
out west, it's very very similar, I think there's really only a couple of
different profiles that stand out, there's the more like gassy lemony one
like the SFV, there's the more earthy one like the Malibu and then there's kind of
what you find in a good example recently was like the black triangle from Bodhi,
that triangle ADA G13 hash plant, very very dank like what I call like a
traditional kush type profile and the Malibu and the Topanga, honestly a lot
of them when I've seen them, they're very very similar, so I can't really say
that there would be much of a difference between them, somebody who would probably
be better suited to speak on that might be the doctor from archive, he might have
seen more, I mean I've seen the Malibu when I was in San Diego in like the
early 2000s and when I've seen the Topanga brought up, very very similar in
my opinion and I know there's I think there's the Hollywood PK2 is what
they're calling it as well. Yeah there's a stack of different ones, I guess the
thing I'm most interested in is do you think that the more lemon based OGs came
maybe from an S1 of say the more earthy, the more pure kush type ones or do
you think maybe it was the other way around or do you think they just evolved
independently? That's a good question, I mean I would think that they came from
the more earthy ones just because I kind of feel like that's the base of that
genetic so it would make sense to me that an outlier might be the more
lemony one and the lemony ones are very very popular for a specific reason
because they have that they have that gassy profile but they also have that
stick to your palate flavor that pretty much cuts through anything and so I feel
like it was probably an outlier of the earthier kushes that people were
probably getting back in the day. Yeah that certainly seems to make sense and
then so I guess to kind of bring this a little bit full circle a lot of people
often talk about feeling like there's a kush component within Girl Scouts and by
extension within the sherbs, do you see that yourself and if so what type of
kush influence do you think is within the sherb? So at least with the Girl Scout
cookies I would say when you look at it and the way that it grows it grows very
very similar to the SFVs in terms of just the way the flower sets the size of
the flowers on them the internodal spacing on it and the long petioles that
you see on them if you've ever seen like the OGs grown or whatnot they don't
require a lot of plucking because they don't they don't pull that they don't
put out a lot of leaves they stretch a whole lot and that's similar to what we
first saw in the forum. With the sherb I could see it as well it's just selected
away from that to a plant that stacks a little bit more is a little bit tighter
puts out fatter flowers that the colas are you know three or four flowers set
together not not kind of like what you see with the SFVs or the OGs and it's
firmer the the branches aren't as floppy. With the OGs you know they require a lot
of work because you know they want they want to get all kind of over the place
they require a lot of maintenance on them. Yeah okay and so overall are you
put off by these types of structures because that's a common complaint we
hear from some people. Yes and no it I think it really just depends on what it
is you're trying to achieve I mean a properly grown OG is one of the best
flowers you'll ever see so to me it's worth it and there's a reason why it's
stuck around so long I think part of why we stopped seeing the OGs in the kind of
volume that we used to see them in is just because the price dropped on the
market and so you know it wasn't worth growing anymore it was worth growing
something that was a heavier yielder that required less work that was less
finicky so for me personally I love a phenomenal OG and I've never seen a
plant with better structure let's say that actually delivered the same type of
flower so if you could find it in something that had better structure and
growth habits I would absolutely take it but having never really seen anything
like that myself I'm you know I'm saying it had it stuck around for a long time
for a reason and I know Inspecta has done some S1 work with the triangle and
the Chem 91 and still though the plants still look even though he's got some
that stack a little bit better it looks like there's they still have the same
viney structure it just requires a lot of maintenance to them. Yeah certainly so
you just got to grow it properly so you raised a really interesting point which is kind of
on a very different topic but I'd love to quickly go there where you mentioned
that although these OGs were elite and they're amazing flower people stopped
growing them because they kind of fell out of favor and I witnessed this
firsthand when I was in the States whereby I had a bag of what was meant to
be some sort of like exotic type of cookie type of thing you know and it was
grown it looked nice but it had no turps had no flavor was really quite bland but
it looked pretty good and then next to it was a bag of the the clone only
headband that's the same one that mr. Bob has so I know that it's like a
really good one and that the smell was just super piney lemony gassy like
everything you'd want the flavor was on point and I'm having this talk with
people and they're like yeah these bags would go for about the same price and I
was like what but like the headbands clearly way better and they were like
yeah but people have smelt that one before like they used to that smell you
know do you feel like that's a problem within the consumer market that we can
get to this point where shittily grown exotics are fetching the same or more
than like a really killer tried and tested clone only but just because of
like a name and a hype thing they're willing to go with the exotic one yeah I
mean I think I think we're already there you know at this point there's a lot of
what what people are terming exotics a term that they're using pretty loosely
now but there's a lot of those going around and literally just just putting
it I mean honestly at this point just putting it in the right in the right bag
makes all the difference and there is there is a segment of the market that
will pay for that and the general populace doesn't really know the
difference at all so the staples like I mean I don't know if you remember the J
one I used to love the J one and it was a phenomenal flower really really good
high nice taste people do not like Jack they've seen so much Jack especially in
Cali that they don't want to see it anymore they're over it so I think like
the higher-end market they want I mean if you've noticed there's you know
do-si-do cross with gelato and you know do-si-do cross with sherb and that's
really what people want I mean I made something pretty weird a couple years
ago and it has no traction it's Vietnam black tie grand doggie perp crossed with
a grand doggie perp banana limon yeah and that was that was across that took a
long time to make I made you know I selected the limon from I selected the
limon male I hit it to the banana cut we had I found a male in that and hit it to
a grand doggie perp female then I found a male from that and then separate from
that I had selected a Vietnam black tie from ace and hit that with a grand doggie
perp male and then selected a female from that and then work together that
female and the and the other male and it's a whole lot of work in there and
really nobody really has any interest in it I mean it's you know a couple of
people that I know that that that do care about quality flower they've told
me they've grown it and they've told me it's some of the most unique turps
they've ever seen and they love it but generally speaking if you put something
like that on the market number one most people you tried to explain all those
genetics to them they they would just go right over their head they would get a
blank look on their face but if you just tell them oh it's girl scout cookie
crossed with OG kush okay they probably know those things and they're just gonna
go for what they know versus you know what something completely unique and
different and that's not you know it's it's kind of where we're at now where
people will take a poorly grown example of some kind of exotic that looks good
or photographs well I mean honestly people are buying things because they
can take a picture of and post it on their Instagram so if the headband
smells phenomenal to you in person has a great effect but the purple punch
whatever cross looks good and they can photograph it and put it on their
Instagram and get a bunch of likes that's what they're gonna do most people
I mean that's what they're gonna do all things being equal so yeah no I totally
get that do you feel like this is gonna ultimately negatively affect everyone in
the growers start growing out these strains and we maybe lose some of these
better ones like objectively better but just not demanded I do there's been a
huge shift in terms of people cultivating varieties that are
photogenic because they want them to look good on Instagram some plants don't
photograph well no matter how you grow them like the chem D is kind of is one
of those plants it doesn't photograph well doesn't really I mean it looks okay
in a bag it can be done right as it were but it's never gonna look like a gelato
sherb cross would look it's never gonna have that bag appeal it's not gonna have
the purple tones that photograph well so there's a lot of genetics that are
getting lost off and I mean even even when I've tried to share genetics with
people to help back up some of the work they don't care because if it's not
something that they can immediately put into production most people don't want
to do it and so there's there's really it cost a lot of money it takes a lot of
time to back up all these genetics and I know that's something that inspector
could relate to it's a conversation that we've had here and there about that just
so big commitment to do all that work and keep all that together most people
don't want it I mean a similar example is a plant we have called the Lucy it's
a chem 91 butterscotch Hawaiian very very unique terpene profile not the
highest yielder a little bit finicky whatnot but it's you know it's not
something that I don't think anyone in my circle has kept it around I think one
person that operates a rec facility has it and other than that it's not a plant
that anyone really wants but when I hit it with the tricks and a friend of mine
has grown them out now the owner of the facility came by and when he was
checking out all the different stuff that they were growing what he remarked
about amongst you know maybe six or seven different breeders work that they
had going there was that the patch of work that was that they that had that
had come from my work all the strange plants that my friend had selected
independently were the most unique profiled plants he had seen and one one
was that Lucy he said he never smelt anything like it before and for me
that's that's a big part of why I keep those plants around because although
they're of zero value to most people mostly because they don't really know
what they're worth they don't really see the value in it they don't understand
that if you cross it into something else you're opening up a whole new gene pool
like but if you just hit gelato to do-si-do yeah you're gonna get a bunch
of plants that smell similar that give kind of somebody in Iowa let's say the
ability to grow that type of a plant and smell that type of a profile but at the
end of the day you're not really doing anything special you're not really
opening up the possibility of anything unique I like to take things from the
far end of the spectrum and combine them together and that's I think where you're
gonna find really really different plants but somebody has to keep those
plants around and you literally keep nobody wants them you can't find people
that you could you'd have to pay people to keep them around for you if you can't
keep them. God so many things you just said I just so deeply relate to like
yeah I know what you mean and what I wanted to first ask you because I got so
many things I need to ask you in relation to that first thing the chem 91
butterscotch cross is that from Bodie or Rado? No so that's not Rado's
butterscotch I don't even I don't know the lineage of his butterscotch this was
made by someone named poor white farmer he was off IC mag years ago and I believe
it might have been from reef I believe the butterscotch Hawaiian came from reef
and he found a male and there hit the chem 91 and then somebody named easy
Rasta selected the clone he passed it to a couple of our friends on IC mag and
that's how I ended up getting it and I don't know that either of them are I
mean they may still be alive but I don't neither of them I haven't seen either of
them active in years so I'm not sure where where that work lies but yeah no
that's not from Rado I'm not even sure what the lineage on his butterscotch is
to be honest I don't know if you might know what it is yeah no I would probably
have to look into it before I say something incorrect that's I'm trying to
try to vet some of the more random things I say recently so I'll hold up on
that one I remember seeing a post with that chem 91 butterscotch cross in it
and I remembered seeing in that same post and you also just mentioned it that
there was like a I think it was crossed to tricks yeah yeah I crossed it to the
tricks yeah and so I wanted to ask you a little bit about tricks I noticed that
sometimes you refer to it as gb6 tricks what does that mean so originally I
believe that when low-key selected the plant he got it as as gorilla breath
that he did a project with gromer and there was a bunch of work that came out
of that and that's one of those plants and when he selected it I think it was
just the gorilla breath six and he named it tricks because of the flavor profile
on it the way like the way like the kind of the smell that it gives off and so
the shortened version is just gb6 tricks rather than gorilla breath six tricks
that makes sense as a quick little side note what do you think of our friend
gromer you know I've had a few people come on the show saying well he's very
blatantly ripped off gauge green but then on the other hand people seem to
turn a bit of a blind eye to that and you know friendly with him what's your
take on that situation I mean yeah he obviously did so that's I don't think
that's up for discussion at this point because the work was all based on the
Mendo breath and I think he has a line recently that's just another gauge green
kind of rip I think he took I forget what a grateful breath or something and
started a whole nother line with that so but yeah I mean he you know it's it's
it's one of those things where it would have been previously frowned upon
clearly not frowned upon now I'm sure he made a whole bunch of money for himself
and he sells them at a low price point because there's really no work involved
in them I mean you know I could take a pack from you know archive right now and
do the same thing and people I mean there's people who have done that with
with work that was put out with my work so it's kind of one of those things
where you know it's he gave people access to something he did it in numbers
he did it in volume he cut the price real low so personally you know for me
no but for people who are just trying to make some money I totally get it it
makes sense it was there to be had and people clearly support him and I mean
the work that's come from it hasn't been bad because you know it's means a lot of
it is dosido and Mendo breath you know dosido from archive and Mendo breath
from gauge both both you know made in collaboration with NorCal and that OGKB
clone so not really I mean not not something that I would do to be honest
but not mad at him either because I'm sure he made a pile of money off it and
is still making a pile of money off of it there's a lot of people out there
doing work with integrity that are broke so you know you can kind of look at it
and see really at the end of the day like who's really winning there it's
interesting that exactly what you said holds true in my opinion the best clone
that exists in Australia is a jelly breath clone from in-house genetics and
that's just dosido cross Mendo breath you know it's just his version his
feminized version of essentially the peanut butter breath from groma but yeah
you can't deny it's some really nice weed but I just wanted to loop back for
a moment the reason why all of this stimulated my interest initially
especially in regards to that gorilla breath was that I had heard rumors of
other well-known strains being given the same genetics and I probably need to
explain this a little bit specifically I'd heard that smell boats rainbow SS
og was in fact just gorilla glue for Mendo breath and I'd asked him about it
and he was like what no way like neither of those plants are you can't even see
any traits from those plants in this thing but what it made me realize was
when I was hearing these rumors it was just kind of like two really popular
strains thrown together it was almost as if like people didn't know what a
certain cross was so they were like oh it's probably like GG for cross Mendo
breath like as in like it was just two popular things you could throw together
and imply that someone's just kind of chucking these two popular things
together have you ever heard of any other strains being called like oh it's
probably GG for Mendo breath even though like it doesn't really appear to be or
anything like that or is that just my own little weird experience no yeah and
I mean I'm kind of familiar with small boat but I had never heard that about
that particular cross I'm sure that somebody else has done a GG for Mendo
breath I would be surprised if they hadn't that sure there's a GG for dose
you know out there I could bet on that one for sure the Mendo breath you know
it wasn't it was they both kind of came at the same time and then one ended up
obviously exceeding the popularity of the other significantly in my opinion
that being the dose you know I mean we actually we actually were the ones that
sold that clone originally that NorCal cut when that cut actually came out it
was through a delivery service that I had an SF at the time and we released
the do-si-do NorCal cut the number six and the Mendo breath cut which was the
platinum and those you know one one really took off which was that do-si-do
and the other one didn't really trend as much was the Mendo breath so really
though I think the person that's worked with the Mendo breath the most obviously
besides Gage has been Gromer because he worked with it for a long time it has to
be years now yeah I don't really know that anyone else has really worked with
it that significantly yeah well I mean I guess just to kind of wrap up this
little side we've been talking about what are your thoughts on Gage I mean
they're weird there's no denying that I don't think there's a they're a little
bit strange muscle I'm friends with NorCal and NorCal and my buddy Frost
boss and my buddy on nonprofit and myself we all go back a long way in the
Bay Area the four of us and NorCal was how I came to know about Gage but he's
he's a really good guy he's open to working with a lot of people and he
worked with Gage in some way shape or form my understanding of their
relationship was that it was not very beneficial to him and so in that regard
to me not really people that I'm a huge fan of simply because if my friend says
that it didn't go right I know the kind of guy he is so I imagine it's on their
side plus I've seen them caught up in all kinds of all kinds of online
debating and whatnot and people who debate online are not people that I want
to associate with so the work is interesting they seem weird and I
personally have never run any of their work besides the MendoBreath cuttings
that NorCal gave me but I know a lot of people like their work so you know I
think I think one of them is a flat earther that's a little bit strange to
me and then just the way that they present themselves online is kind of
off-putting to me and the reality is besides the MendoBreath I don't really
know any of their other work that I'm intrigued by.
Yeah that's an interesting point I mean I'll be honest there's a few of their
crosses I've seen that do catch my eye particularly that high school sweetheart
one but I agree with you they're an interesting crew and our friend
Michael Fung the flat earther he's another interesting chap and I wouldn't
be surprised if one day we get him on the show I think it'd be a cool chap but
anyway let's let's take it back now we've been having a good little detour
here let's go back to our original first question which we normally start
the show with what was your first experience with cannabis? Wow yeah my
first experience of cannabis was with some friends of mine when I was younger
one of their parents was a deadhead and I was spending the night over there and
they stole they stole a little bit of flour from them and we sat up after
everyone went to bed and smoked it you laid down and had that typical first
experience where you're wondering like am I feeling anything or what is this
everything went fine didn't think anything of it went to bed the next day
woke up felt a little bit different just thinking okay well clearly it's not it's
not what the DARE program and everybody else said it was I think I was about
like 13 at the time and then I really didn't didn't smoke much after that it
took a couple years before I really got into smoking because it didn't it didn't
really grab me and then I remember meeting with some friends where I was
living in Miami at the time and grabbing some flour from one of their older
brothers he actually had some blueberry and remember smoking that and being like
oh yeah okay like I get it now and pretty much obsessed with that I mean I
think we ended up going to see a movie at the mall and I we were waiting for
the movie we went up in the parking garage to smoke right before the movie I
walked back in there was some benches in front of the movie theater I remember
laying down and telling them when it was time to go in I said no I'm good you
guys can go I'm good they told me like you can't lay out here man you have to
you have to come into the movie theater but I loved it I completely fell in love
with it it's I mean it's a it's a plant that you know it changed my life I've
been dedicated to this plant for you know over 20 years now and in spite of
everything else any little detours I've taken in life I've always circled back
to the plant constantly it's it's the mean it changed my life clearly just
like a lot of the people that you probably speak to clearly we've
dedicated a long while like a lot of time and energy into this so yeah I've
been I was kind of spoiled though because I'd never seen I'd never seen
regs before and in Florida there was really only like regs or like like like
nugget you know it was like oh you either had you either had creepy or you
had regs and I was spoiled because I'd only smoked like I'd only smoked
cribby I only smoked like hind butter whatever you want to call it I only
smoked like nicer indoor flower and then I remember the first time I saw some
regs we all we all faded in on I'm supposed to be like I think like a
quarter pound and when my friends asked me to fade in on it I was kind of
surprised by like the small amount of money that it was and when they showed
up with it and started breaking it up I didn't even know what the seeds were I
was completely confused about the stems the seeds all of that I tried to take
one hit of a blunt they rolled and I said no I'm good I'm just gonna hit my
pipe and my little jar weed that I brought with me. Wow there you go and was
that when you say regs was that kind of like brick weed or just like not as good
as kind? Brick weed brick weed pressed Miami brick weed. Yeah well and so I know
that back in those days names weren't a big thing but do you remember the first
name strain you ever smoked? So my friend's brother would get blueberry
that was the first thing that I actually smoked and then in Florida there was a
juicy fruit which was like another one that was popular I want to say the other
one was called orange crush and there was like one more that I can't remember
off top but really there was only I don't know how it is in Australia but
when in Florida there you only could really get from people that you knew and
if it wasn't like brick weed basically out of like some suspect spot it was
through the same kind of contacts and they just had the same type of stuff and
so you really didn't have much of an option and so we would get a lot of that
juicy fruit that orange crush I forget what some of the other ones were and
then a friend of mine actually grew some of the first stuff from seed I ever saw
which was they had brought back some shish kabari seeds and so that was that
was like the first actual something from seed that I where I knew the people that
actually grew it. That's cool okay so did you have like an inclination towards
spice of life at that point given shish kabari kind of opened your eyes or was
that like an afterthought? To be honest I didn't even know who they were I was so
paranoid about any kind of online searching for anything at that time that
I didn't want anything to do with it and in Florida if you knew someone like you
just you just didn't say anything because the people that were growing were
so quiet about it that you you just you couldn't say anything about anything to
anybody so it wasn't even really it wasn't really even a conversation that
you could have with someone to even ask questions about. It was more like here
I've got this take it you don't want it okay you can't have it now because you
took too long you asked questions they didn't like it so you just you know you
had it was like if you didn't grow up with certain people you were just you
were excluded from certain circles you just weren't welcome. So I didn't even
know about Steve or spice of life or any of that but I have I have enjoyed some
of his work I like the blue satellite from him I would like to grow some shish
kabari at some point it's kind of a shame because a lot of that flower
nowadays with the way the rec markets are moving here in the States they're
not really desirable because a lot of those higher terpene interesting
different varieties they know they don't test over 20% and consumers in the stores
that's that's what they're really obsessed with is like varieties over 20%
and you know if something has a really really unique terpene profile but it
tests 13 or 14% it's gonna be eliminated that's another thing that's gonna
affect the gene pool going forward is like this focus on commercial breeding
is really is really gonna change what people are doing. I think it's interesting
because I think it's this the same situation in the States but it's
certainly the case down under that there's this whole kind of Renaissance
and explosion of craft beers and there's this idea of like people are moving away
from just your stock standard commercial stuff and looking for that more boutique
type of thing do you think that'll ever happen with cannabis or the current
trend you just described where people are kind of a bit ignorant of what
they're actually looking for as a consumer do you think that will continue?
I think I think it might happen I think it'll take time and by then I think we'll
have lost a lot of the genetics they'll they'll be people here and there that
have preserved some things there'll be some seeds that we'll be able to pull
from but I do feel like there's a lot of diversity that's getting lost and work
that's not being done. One day consumers might might be educated enough might be
interested enough in asking for that but currently with the way the
regulatory landscape is set up it's very difficult to operate and I think that in
the future when we're able to actually have interstate commerce so if you know
if a facility was located let's say and then you know Arizona but it could ship
all over the country kind of like you know a small vineyard might I think
you'll have more access to that boutique market the same way that the
breweries do but right now with the way it's set up and you know just kind of
having to operate within a state and comply with the local regulations and if
you want to expand into another state you have to set up another facility it's
just not it's it's geared towards rich people it's geared towards the wealthiest
people and right now what they're doing is they're grabbing the hugest piece of
the markets possible they're setting up all across the country so there you know
they'll be everywhere before they give the craft people kind of a chance to
expand and Oregon has a small craft market but it's been brutal and
Oklahoma's about to go through the same thing a lot of people are popping up
over there because it's so inexpensive but what's gonna happen is the same
thing that happened in Oregon markets just gonna get decimated and a lot of
people are gonna lose are gonna are gonna lose what they've invested not
everyone is gonna survive that but I do think that Oregon is a place where you
might see that craft market and you know I could point to brands like resin
ranchers smaller companies that feed you know they understand the market and they
not they're not over producing they could expand they choose not to they've
found a happy medium in a way to survive within that but they also had deep deep
roots in the medical scene before the recreational market hit so they had
those relationships in place they had local connections they were able to make
the transition and I'm sure at some point you know if we spoke to them they
would tell you it wasn't easy but they managed to make it work and people know
you know and our archive is a good curator of local kind of craft products
in Oregon if people want to if you can get your product on their shelf it says
something about your company. Yeah right I remember when I visited the Oregon
store a few years ago they definitely had some nice flower there something I
forgot to mention earlier when you're talking about J1 how good is J1 I love
J1. I love J1 people people maybe it's me and you then but people don't
people don't seem to care for it I think it's a phenomenal flower I think it's
resinous it's flavorful it grows impeccably it yields well I love the high
from it I feel like a lot of people they want the narcotic high nowadays they
have for years but they especially seem to want it now I don't know if it's just
the current state of affairs or whatnot but I think the J1 is a phenomenal
flower I mean I'm I was I grew that plant for a long time and I was I was
bummed when I lost it I know I know it still exists I know some people still
grow it and really I mean it's a Jack profile with better structure better
flower better finishing time better bag appeal I think it's amazing I love it
yeah the thing I noticed about it is no one breathes with it ever that's true
that's true I would like to at some point I definitely need to make an
effort to get that cut back in the rotation but yeah if you look around you
don't see any crosses with it part of that might be because I think people
wonder that if you put Jack into something is anyone gonna want it and
it's weird a lot of breeding is done with that kind of intention like what is
the market gonna want and for years you know I mean even even before I started
you know offering seeds publicly I just bred whatever I wanted I didn't really
think about what people wanted I thought about what what I wanted to see and I
mean that's that's why I bred the stuff that I've made like has nothing that had
literally zero consideration for the market at all you know but I learned I
mean it's easy to see like what people want and what they don't want but I
think I think a plant like the J1 just if you tell people there's Jack in
something especially in the Bay Area the face they're gonna make is not is not
one of approval. Well that's almost like a bit of a good little segue so if we
loop back to you were talking about how you'd started smoking what was the
progression like in the transition from say smoker to grower for you? Yeah so I
started smoking for I mean I grew up in Florida it's a pretty difficult state to
operate and I think you know you find a lot of people in this especially on the
west coast that were from Florida because you had to have a real passion
for it and that's something that doesn't get tamped out I mean at the
time I was going to school in Gainesville and I was growing I it's a
friend of mine had started growing when he came back from Amsterdam and when I
saw it I'd seen a setup before I didn't even know what it was when I saw it a
friend of mine took me to a friend's basement in Chicago and I went downstairs
he you know he said hey it's my guy he's cool whatever whatever he takes me
downstairs and I see a makeshift space I think it honestly I think it had to be
like two by fours and some kind of plastic it wasn't not anything fancy and
he opens it up and I see a bulb in there and some light and some plants and in
retrospect now looking back I'm like yeah they were they were pretty rough
looking but I didn't know the difference between a metal halide and an HPS
whatever it might be and I asked him kind of some questions and he was
actually making seeds in there he had a male in there and he was actually making
seeds which totally random that kind of surprised me but it kind of stuck with
me and it made me think like wow you could just you can just do this not
having ever seen anyone do it before it just I said yeah this is something that
you could do if you just had a little bit of space so when I got back to
Florida I sold a guitar and an amp that I had and I went and bought a 400 watt
light and I set up a space at a house that I was renting and I remember padlocking
the door you know if we would have some people over here and there and somebody
would say something about the smell I would tell them oh you know we smoke we
smoke a lot of weed and they would inevitably say that's not what weed
smoke smells like but I remember setting up just a small closet space with a 400
and I got some cuttings from a friend of mine I started growing them in there
grew them and it actually was some reclining Buddha by Soma at the time and
I remember growing it and somebody that I used to somebody I used to provide
mentioned something about the cherry flavor in the flower not knowing that I
had grown it not knowing anything about it supposedly having a cherry type
flavor and I remember that really stuck with me and it made me it made me think
about all the different possibilities that were that were out there and I was
in school I didn't like it I did not enjoy the whole school system to be
honest I thought it was kind of a waste of time and money and a money grab for
the most part I think you know for certain professions it makes sense but
in general for all kids to go to school just doesn't really make a lot of sense
and so I was growing for about a year and a half out there and I remember just
it was you know it's mandatory minimums at the time for any kind of cultivation
there so like a single plant was you know mandatory minimum I think it was
three to five years and at that point I had I had a friend who moved to San
Diego and so in talking with him and you know my family they basically said
like hey if you're gonna keep doing this maybe you should just move out west so
you don't go to jail and I packed up I sold everything and I moved out west and
gave it a shot out there in San Diego that's actually where I got my first
taste of like real Southern California like high grade because I used to fly
out there all the time but like living out there and being out there was
totally different you really got to see what was happening and at the time there
there was a medical scene this was after 215 had passed and it was very
very different what was happening out there they had clubs but they were
getting shut down and harassed San Diego is a beautiful place but it's very
conservative and not very very cannabis friendly although there is a large scene
there but that was where I first started seeing things like the bull rider the p91
the cat piss all that stuff and they grew some out they had some Afghani
whatnot and I just remember seeing just the sheer volume of flower that was
coming out of the out of out of the area in general and it really you know it
stuck with me and so I had the chance to move out there I gave it a go it didn't
work out a friend of mine got addicted to oxys so that that kind of went
sideways I don't know how much people have spoken about that kind of stuff but
this business is not easy the lifestyle is not easy it's a lot you know you
might see people that people think are successful but I don't think people know
everything they had to go through and how many times they had to try and how
many times they didn't quit before they were able to see some success I mean
it's a tough business and you know definitely that type of lifestyle at the
time it was not a traditional lifestyle so you know definitely pills and whatnot
and everything were around and that's kind of when oxys but I think we're
starting to get a hold on people out there so that didn't really work out I
ended up leaving everything moving back east working again saving some more
money and then I was kind of over it because I hadn't I hadn't been to NorCal
I was kind of over it San Diego just reminded me of LA and Miami crossed
together and I said to do that I'll just go back and live in Miami I like Miami
and then some friends of mine were out in Lake Tahoe and they invited me out
for the summer to go visit out there they lived on what I call perpetual
hippie tour so they just you know work save money go on hippie tour come back
broke work save money same thing over and over again and I went out there to
Lake Tahoe and it was stunning it was beautiful I'd never seen anything like
it never seen anything like it I don't know if you've had the chance to get to
Lake Tahoe but it's beautiful stunning you know impactful and had a chance to
go down to Oakland with my friends and I remember being at somebody's house at
a friend of my friend's house and they had told him you know this is this is my
guy been friends for a long time so everything was fine with me and him but
somebody came by with a duffel bag and a bunch of perps a bunch of perp packs and
which was you know huge in the Bay Area at that time that was like around 2005
2006 and I remember them you know doing whatever they were doing with the perp
packs and then him pulling out like a pound of purple keef and saying like I
don't know what to do with this and at that point that's when I chimed in and
said you know well you know I'll take that and he didn't know who I was he was
completely thrown off by me the guy sitting on the couch smoking not saying
anything saying I'll take that and but it just it was obvious to me at that
point that like I was in the wrong place because I'm in a city right now where
people have a pound of purple keef and don't know what to do with it I've never
seen a pound of purple keef anywhere like so it blew my mind that I was like
yeah I'm coming back to Oakland and so you know I went home I worked saved more
money sold everything I owned and rented a warehouse off Craigslist not it not
having ever seen it and just moved out with two duffel bags and you know bought
some lights and got to work out there and kind of built up from there I mean
it definitely you know it wasn't was not easy to give it a run and if you spent
any time in Oakland Oakland is getting gentrified now it's a lot more cleaned
up as it were but still a rough city and still you know but a place a place that
lives eats and sleeps high-grade cannabis in my opinion I know my
friends in SoCal might differ but I think I think the Bay Area is the
epicenter of global cannabis not even not even you know just in California but
globally and no knock on you know Humboldt or whatever the Emerald
Triangle all that stuff they do their thing up there but if you really really
look at who's been making the waves over the last decade it's the Bay Area and if
anyone has any claim before that it's SoCal you know with the OG's but since
then it's been all the Bay Area I mean all of it you know the cookies the
gelatos the sherbs everything all this stuff it's just been Bay Area Bay Area
Bay Area for you know probably the last seven or eight years maybe ten years
yeah hundred percent I mean there's there's so many things we can touch on
there the first thing I wanted to do before we move past it you mentioned the
Bull Rider the P91 and the Cat Pierce down in San Diego sounds like you were
down there when Matt was kind of doing his thing Matt Riot were you familiar
with him at all or not really I was not I avoided any kind of social interaction
possible with people that were outside of my circle I think it's a big reason
why I've managed to kind of stay out of trouble a lot of these guys have had
run-ins or had you know people snitch on them or whatever it might be or get
robbed and I pretty much avoided everyone I was connected with one circle
of people out there that had access to all of those flowers they were born and
raised in San Diego so all those guys you know had gone to school there and so
they you know they all they all had the local connections for those flowers and
a lot of those flowers I mean you don't see them anymore like anywhere and even
the Bull Rider it fell off years and years later I know people are out there
now saying that they still have it and grow it I'd like to see it to see if it
is what it is I almost think at this point you could just tell people it's
Bull Rider and them having never seen it they wouldn't know the difference
because it's just some Afghani right yes supposedly you know not having been
there for for it that's my understanding of it and you know it didn't have the
big of the best bag of peel or anything it was big flowers you could tell it
yielded and there was also there was a super silver haze that was being grown
out there in Long Beach at the time too that was phenomenal I mean ridiculous
and there was a Cali mist and I mean I kind of I kind of missed those days
there was some flower that you couldn't buy like there was such a limited amount
it was already spoken for people would prepay for the flower which is something
that I don't know that if young people even like would understand what that is
like they would prepay before the harvest so that they could have their
their share of that harvest and there was a super silver haze that was like
that and the guy that I knew who would get it he wouldn't sell any of it he
would only trade me so I'd have to trade him like that's that the super silver
haze let's say that I would get for the Cali mist that he was getting and it was
just like a one-to-one trade that was it like as much as I was willing to give up
that's as much as he was willing to give up and it was um you know it's different
there was just there was more limited limited flower out there at the time but
you know I didn't I didn't know Matt yeah seems like he seems like he was
more social I mean definitely I think he wasn't like the punk rock scene and
whatnot so he was definitely out there I was hanging out with Jamaicans and a
totally different type of scene in like Mission Beach and PB out there yeah cool
okay and so then what was your transition from going as just a grower
to then starting to make your own seeds yeah so so we were on IC mag a bunch of
us and you know I had tried to buy seeds years ago off like heaven stairway or
something did they didn't make it I freaked out I was in Florida at the time
I said I'm not buying anything else through the mail I'm over it and then I
knew people that were buying off off IC mag off seed Bay and seed boutique and
so I said you know what I said I'm gonna I'm gonna start getting some seeds and I
started just collecting some seeds and sending some money orders here and there
and grabbing some stuff and I actually the first thing I ever tried to do was I
took a mail from a pack of Soma's reclining Buddha and tried to hit a
bunch of things but I learned a valuable lesson from that in that like at all
everything that I grew from that was terrible it was all trash and I hit it
to my bubble jack the East Coast sour and a couple other things and they were
just trash it was nothing good came from that mail and so I chucked all those
seeds whatever whatever with that and then some friends of mine were doing a
lot of outdoor work and you know we were talking about like how the blue dream
would go deep into November there's a great plant for outdoor cultivation but
they wanted something that would finish faster and I had some Williams wonder
from reef and so we popped those found a mail and hit hit the blue dream with
that because we figured all right this is gonna be a plant that is gonna
this is really gonna be a phenomenal plant for outdoor cultivation it should
finish faster from the Afghani influence it should still be resinous it should
still you know be real chunky hopefully pick up some resistance to PM and
betrayed us and whatever it might be so we started that project and that's
something we worked on over a couple of years just kind of in our own world
nothing to do with any kind of thoughts towards vending seeds or a seed company
or anything it was just something that we worked on collaboratively as a group
and so we worked that for a couple of generations and that's where that wet
dream plant came from and that was my first like realization like okay like
yeah you can use a mail but they're definitely not all the same and it
doesn't matter what kind of female you cross it to if the mail is trash like
the work that comes from that is gonna be trash so we got lucky you know we got
lucky and the mail that we used was really solid and from there you know we
did one further selection and then I've done a couple of open open populations
since then just to kind of spread it out and see see what kind of variants we
might find in there and not not bottleneck the gene pool so that's you
know that was probably the first actual breeding projects that we did as a group
was just a couple of friends with just an intention to breed something that
would do better and finish faster and at the time we weren't even really doing
the depths it was all just the larger full season plants so we just wanted
something that would still you know throw down big plants but finish quicker
and what was your impressions of the Williams wonder strain that's something
we frequently reminisce about on the show yeah so I we loved it some of the
when when I was living in Chicago for a while I was staying out there for a
little bit and the packs that we would get were the Willys is what we used to
call them and they were coming out of Oregon at the time which my understanding
is like that's where that variety was developed and I loved it I mean
beautiful like electric green resinous flowers large like nowadays you know it
would be hard it would be hard to really find something comparable to it but
because you know a lot of what's popular now is like the candy stuff and the
fruit sweet stuff or whatever it might be it was like a real hashy plant but
potent you know potent like the high from it was was what we really really
enjoyed it's beautiful beautiful flower and that's something that I mean you
just you don't see it around anymore there's like I mean I imagine it might
still exist somewhere I like I think it's back then I've talked about it
there's usually someone in the hill somewhere holding something but they
don't talk to anyone and so you probably never see it but that's that's a really
old plant that I just don't think that you see anything like that anywhere else
anymore.
Yeah certainly it seems like people are kind of madly looking for any remnants
of it so for the next little bit of chat I wanted to touch on something which I
think everyone will be really interested to hear the story about which probably a
lot of people aren't actually aware that you were the person who found the forum
cut.
That's true.
Would you be able to give us the backstory on that one.
Yeah absolutely.
People have asked for years I've just never like I said you know I never
really wanted any attention for anything so I mean I think people have people
have said that profit was the one that gave it out and or my other buddy Frost
Boss both of them have probably been both of them have probably been involved
in like the actual story more than myself publicly.
So what happened there was we used to have a get together party and I see mag
party in Vegas that was just kind of just for a bunch of us together like invite
only.
We would like rent a house and get out there and whatnot.
I had tried to avoid as much as humanly possible going to any of these events
just because why do I want to be in a building with a bunch of growers.
So I tried to avoid it for a while but one of our friends had got into some
legal trouble and I had helped him out when he got popped and they took all his
plants.
I always have extra like just I always have an excessive amount of veg plants
because you just never know when you're going to need them and if you need them
I'd rather have them.
You can always chop them down you can always do whatever with them but you at
least have them on deck.
So when when our friend had gotten in trouble and they cut down his garden
taking all his plants and whatnot I knew when he got out he was going to need
some help.
And so I hit him up and just asked if he wanted anything I could help him out.
And so I got him some plants got him replugged and he said to me you know we
have this party in Vegas you should really come out.
I hadn't really wanted to go out but he talked me into it.
So I ended up going out and I met Frost Boss and I don't think Profit Profit was
there that year for the first one.
But I met Frost Boss and I remember hanging out with him and you know we were
both from the Bay and he had told me about something called Cookies.
He said yeah man there's something called Cookies.
Have you heard of it?
And I said no I never heard of it.
He said oh man it's it's special man you should check it out.
And I was like yeah yeah yeah whatever whatever because I was growing nothing
but sour and OGs at that time I didn't really have any interest.
I mean sour and OG had reigned supreme for so long that why would I be
interested in anything else to be honest.
Like I'd seen a lot of people come with other flower.
None of it you know exceeded the sours of the OGs.
So what what was the point?
But he had told me about something called Cookies and whatnot.
And so when we got back he came by my house one day and in his pocket he had a
little smashed up nugget inside a Ziploc bag like a tiny tiny little point three
point four nugget.
And it was abused.
It didn't really look that great.
Had some purple color to it and whatnot.
I didn't think much of it.
I broke it up though I ground it up and I put it in my volcano.
And so I've been vaporizing for a long time.
I do it mostly because of the health benefit but also because it's honestly the
most flavorful way to experience flower in my opinion.
If you're just about the terpene profile if you really just want to know what it
tastes like you know that's going to be the best way to get that full experience.
So I ground it up.
I stuck it in the volcano I vaped it and instantly I kind of I got what he was
talking about.
And I started asking around.
He knew the people he's familiar and you know he knows all he knows that whole
circle.
He's from SF.
But he didn't have access to the cut.
And so I asked and he said yeah if we can get it we should get it.
And so I asked a couple of friends of mine who were actually one of them was the same
person that I worked with on the wet dream and they didn't even know what I was
talking about.
They had no clue.
So I said specifically I said it's something called cookies.
This that and the other.
Ask around and see see if you can find it.
He asked a friend of ours.
He didn't know what it was.
That friend actually asked another person that they knew who ran a hydro store in
the Emeryville area.
And he was married to an Asian girl whose family ran a growth spot somewhere in
that area.
It turned out that although he didn't have it they did.
And we asked about it and they said oh you know we need we need like six grand or
five grand or whatever it was at that time.
And you know we kind of I think we all just kind of looked at each other like you
know is it really is it worth it.
I mean that's that you know it's a lot of money for a cut especially at that time.
And we decided that it was and he basically said he could get a lower price if you
know if we gave him a cut.
So they gave us one plant.
He took a cutting off of it.
My other friend who put it together took a cutting off it.
And my friend who had who had kind of put the whole thing together through these
other people.
He didn't have a place to keep it.
So he gave it to me and said hey hold on to it because he knows if you give it to
me I'm going to hold on to it.
And so I remember getting it and ramping it up and posting about it actually on
IC Mag at the time.
It's probably the first post about cookies like ever publicly.
And I remember posting about it and just saying hey I got this girl's got cookies
blah blah blah whatever.
Grew it you know started growing it out whatnot and it you know showed my buddy
Frost boss and profit the samples of it and it was cookies.
And so we had it at that time.
And what happened was I had a small get together at my house and I gave a cutting
to four different people.
My buddy Frost boss got a cutting profit got a cutting and two other people that
were there got cuttings.
And at that point I didn't pass it with any restrictions.
I didn't say you can't sell it.
I gave it to them for free.
I didn't think they were going to sell it.
I didn't really see what you know what they would.
I didn't think that it would end up going the way that it did.
And what ended up happening was yeah people started hitting them up to buy the
cuts.
People came up from L.A.
people came from all over the place.
Cuttings went to a couple different people from there and then cuttings made it all
the way to the UK.
I know I see many people out there got it got it through people that we know out
here.
And it just kind of it just kind of went off.
I mean it got to the point where when people were typing Girl Scout cookies in the
search engine the IC Mag thread was coming up which is why they made us rename it.
So we weren't allowed to type Girl Scout cookies anymore.
We had to type GSC.
And at that point is when people started calling it the forum cut and it started
because people outside the board and people amongst the board started getting it.
And it really just spread like wildfire.
I mean then I think Animal came.
Animal wasn't a thing at that time.
And you know our buddy Straight Flame he would have some insight into this.
But in my circle with with these guys Animal didn't exist.
There was just cookies.
And as far as we knew that was it.
I didn't there wasn't the word thin mint the word platinum.
None of that had ever been uttered.
There was no there was no differentiation.
It was just cookies.
And I think at that time is when like it started to kind of gain popularity.
And part of it I think part of the reason why I think it did gain the popularity is
because it got out so much.
I think if it hadn't got out nobody would ever really seen it.
It would have been it would have been some of the nicest herb nobody ever got to try.
And to be honest like the packs that they were growing were not very good.
Like the Asian packs and the packs from the guys in the city were not really the greatest
examples of cookies.
I think it really took it getting into the hands of some people who actually cared about
cultivating better flour.
And once once people really put a lot of intent into it they saw like wow you know this is
some really there's some really high grade flour.
It's beautiful you know stunning totally different than anything we were growing at the
time.
And some of the first cookie packs to get to the green door came out of my garden.
And I remember going in there one day after I'd been vending cookie packs to them for a
while and seeing like they had like platinum cookies and I said what's what's platinum
cookies.
I said oh that's that's your cookies.
We just we just renamed it because there's other cookie packs now coming that aren't as
good.
So they started putting like regular cookies there and then platinum cookies.
And then from there came like thin mint and this and that and the cookie guys even came
out and said that it wasn't real cookies.
But if you ask around now like globally speaking if people know cookies it's it's that
cut whatever whatever you know people people.
I think it's kind of one of those things where people might have forum and they might say
oh it's thin mentor it might be this or it might be that.
I know that there was a different group in L.A.
that I've spoken with some friends of my friends down there that had a cookie cut around
the same time.
And so around that like oh nine oh 10 kind of area or yeah basically right around there
is when people started popping up with some of these other ones.
But there really wasn't any differentiation at all.
And the animal became a thing.
I mean I saw the animal from my buddy Frost boss.
That's who I got the cut from.
And we ran them side by side.
They were a little bit different.
But I honestly think that I think there was just a bunch of ass ones of whatever.
Like whatever or a bunch of fem seeds that that forum probably came from and that all
the cookies probably came from because if you've noticed there's never been a cookie
male ever ever like and if you would think if you had the most pop one of the most popular
strains in the last 20 years you would be capitalizing on that by by breeding with the
male.
But it doesn't exist that I've ever seen.
And it's been a long time since since that plant's been out.
So that's you know I think that's probably the majority of the story besides the fact
you know that there was all kinds of all kinds of crazy things going on with that cut.
I mean there was it got to the point where it was it was just everywhere and that
honestly like I've never really said anything about it but that's something that kind of
sat with me a little bit poorly was that people started using the term like whoring it out
and I didn't like that because I felt like it was disrespectful.
I mean it's something that we put out for free.
I put it out for free.
You know we paid for it and we put it out for free.
And so for people to kind of like treat it like that kind of left a salty taste in my
mouth.
I think it's why I really haven't been a proponent of passing out a lot of cuts.
I'm very very selective now about where and who I pass cuts to.
And I learned a lot from that because I think also you started seeing a lot of poor examples
of the flower and that that goes down to one of my one of my one of my favorite hashtags
that I don't use that much but it's basically stop stop giving shitty growers good cuts
because they make it look bad.
Somebody sees an example of it and then says oh well you know I've had cookies and it's
not that good.
No you just had a shitty example of it.
It's it's proper like grown right.
It's beautiful flower and it's look at the staying power.
I mean it's been the most significant variety since OG.
I challenge anyone to point out another variety.
It's not perps either.
I mean I love the perps and it was big in the Bay Area but it never went national.
It never went global.
Like it's a Bay Area thing.
You know nobody in New York was asking for perps.
People did want cookies.
No that's a really good recount.
So I think the first thing I'd want to follow up with is I'd always assumed that the forum
cut was just like an S1 of Thin Mint.
Do you feel that that's maybe not the case or what do you think was the original Girl Scout
cut that the Cookie Fam had?
Yeah so I don't I don't think so.
I think that if anything probably in those like they had they had.
And so Frost Boss I've spoken to him a little bit about it there.
There were some seeded packs back back then and he even he worked like deseeding some
of these packs and we think that that's where the Girl Scout cookies like seeds came
from because I think what happened was that there was I I've always said I could be
wrong and this is one of those things where I'd love to see I'd love to see it if I'm
wrong or if I'm not.
But at the time you know the the OGs and the cherry pie were like what was really really
popular in the Bay.
And a lot of people had those in their gardens and everybody knows that the cherry pie is
unstable.
And whenever I've looked at the cookies that's what I see.
I see cherry pie and OG.
Like I see it I see it in the structure I see it in the color I see it in the flavor I
see it in the profile like all of the above.
Like that's that's what I've seen to me.
I think that there was you know an accidental pollination and they grew some of the seeds
out and that's probably where their cookie cut came from.
I imagine that the forum cut came out of that same pack of seeds let's say as it were out
of those same packs and that they just grew it themselves independently.
And that's where we got that cut from.
I could be wrong but like I said there was the word thin mint had never got uttered like
that word did not exist like that.
That like that description of a specific cutting was not a thing like my buddy Frost Boss
never said oh there's this thin mint or there's this platinum.
It was just cookies and after cookies came like animal and that was it.
Like it was cookies and then animal.
And then I started hearing people talk about thin mint and all this other stuff.
I think that may have been a reaction on their part to try and say hey we have something
that's not what everyone else has.
It's not the cut that's going around.
We have thin mint cookies and that's the cookie fan version of it.
But I could be wrong.
You know I would love to hear their perspective on it if that's the case.
Like you know one of the things that does crack me up is when they talk about the breeding
because if you bred it where's the male like and even if not what did you reverse to make
it happen.
They keep talking about oh it's this and F1 derb and blah blah blah.
It's like I was in the bay.
There were people can say whatever they want to say and I'd love to have my buddy straight
flame clarify some points and he might.
I'd never seen it you know and we've seen a lot of flower and just the Bay Area is very
very tight like in terms of like what's happening and who's growing what like people know
what's going around like we eat sleep and breathe it.
And so if there was such a thing we would have heard about it.
It's not a thing like and if you like I said if there was this F1 derb and you used it to
make this you know generational flower why not use it again.
Yeah.
Like where is it at.
So with all that being said about the Girl Scout cookies do you tend to try to avoid
working with the forum cut now because it is so widespread and used or is it just something
you're not particularly interested in working with or do you have plans for in the future.
How do you see the whole situation.
Yeah.
So I've actually have my bread with it.
Yeah.
You know I actually hit it once and I only made a few seeds with it.
I did a forum with the with the Sherb but I've never actually grown.
I haven't grown them out yet.
I mean I think initially when we first got it like I just I had such respect for people
breeding that I just didn't really feel like that was like the thing to do was just to
like run on it and just cash in on it and whatnot.
So just avoided it.
And now I think generally I think I'm just more interested in other types of work.
There's so much work that's similar to it now whether it's the do-si-do and whatnot that I
just don't really see what I would do with it.
If anything for me you know as a plant in and of itself I appreciate it for breeding
purposes.
It's not really the direction that I'm looking to go in.
One of the things that really surprised me about it was you know we'd all been told and
kind of the common thought was that oh it's a crazy polyhybrid and whatnot.
So you know you're not it's not going to be stable you're not going to find anything good
in it.
It's actually incredibly dominant in a lot of the crosses like it really really comes out in
the crosses similar to kind of how the do-si-do does.
The cookie the cookies tend to really really shine through in a lot of these crosses.
So for me it's not that I'm avoiding it.
I've actually thought about doing a femme project with the forum.
I thought it might be fun.
There's just a lot of other stuff on the plate that's kind of like looking forward that I
think are more valuable you know in terms of in terms of what I'm trying to do with my
time.
So as much as I love it I think I would include it in some projects but not necessarily
right now is like the focus of what I'm trying to do.
I could see it being a part of something but not being like the main piece in everything.
Yeah okay.
And so how do you feel about cookies in general not just the various cuttings but like the
brand and where they're trying to take the whole image of it all.
I mean it's cool you know I see them.
I mean there was clearly a split between I think like the like like Scherbinsky and all
those guys even amongst themselves and then Berner with the cookies brand because I think
that's just Berner that cookies brand.
And it's interesting what they've done you know they've definitely capitalized on it.
I have nothing but respect for being able to go out there and get a piece of something
for themselves in terms of like what it actually is like.
I don't have a lot of interest in it in and of itself.
Me definitely can't knock the hustle though.
I see them out there you know between Berner with the stores or Scherbinsky doing his thing.
Some of the other guys they don't seem as active.
I think Pie Guy and Jigga maybe is a little bit more active but I have no knock on it.
I have some of the work that I've seen hasn't been great so I just kind of like not really
excited about it.
I mean I'm sure you saw some of the work at Emerald Cup like there was definitely a lot
of people there that had work that was more impressive to me.
But as a brand I mean there's no denying it.
They've crushed it.
You know it's a huge brand globally recognized at this point and you know whichever one of
them you know whatever piece you're looking at they've definitely done something with it
that I think a lot of people whether they want to admit it or not a lot of people would
have liked to be able to do.
They just weren't able to tie all the pieces together.
Yeah.
So they had something.
Yeah.
And they capitalized on it.
They've certainly done some things well for sure.
But let's talk about what they could have done better.
What do you think are some of the things they've fallen short on.
I honestly think that if they had all stayed working together and not maybe and you know I
wasn't there so I don't know.
But usually in this business there's a lot of ego.
People are used to being what I call king of their own castles.
You know they've all had their own warehouses.
They've all had their own spots.
They're all used to being their own bosses.
A lot of them have never worked for anybody else or even really worked with anybody else in any
kind of significant capacity.
It's why so many of these relationships fall apart in this business.
People don't know how to communicate and set clear expectations.
They're not professional.
I honestly think that there's companies on their way to billion dollar valuations right now.
And if they had all figured out a way to work together they would be on their way to doing
that.
And you know I can't knock anyone.
I would have loved I would love to see anybody from the underground make it to a billion
dollar valuation one day.
And if anybody could have done it it would have been them.
I think that's probably the biggest thing because it kind of seems like Berner just ran with
it and he was really like the least influential person.
I mean he was working at the hemp center as like a security guard if I remember correctly
and kind of just like made the rap thing work and promoted it and you know hustle hustle
hustle then definitely did a lot.
I'm sure.
No knock to be clear.
No knock on his hustle.
I'm sure he busted his ass to get where he is right now because a lot of people were in the
day at that time a lot of people had the opportunity.
But like I said I think the biggest thing is I mean there's been you know fallouts between
those people.
And so I think that's probably the biggest thing that kind of set them set them back and
kept them from fulfilling their potential.
I think if they'd all been able to just work together they would have really achieved
something special.
Yeah definitely.
So something I have been interested in myself and I can't really find a good answer is was
Shabinsky a part of the original crew.
It always felt to me like he came in after they found the Girl Scouts and then had his
little moment in there.
What's your take on all that.
Where does he fit in the picture for you.
Yeah I think I mean I'm pretty sure they were all friends because I think it's Pieguy, Jigga
and Sherb and I think they were all friends you know.
In SF especially it's like it's kind of a like loose knit but very very affiliated city.
Like people there's a lot of people that have grown up out there they know each other you
know they're friends with friends or you know they dated each other's cousins or whatever
it might be like people people have deep deep roots in that city.
And it's a very very small area.
And so you know whether he whether I don't I don't I doubt there was even really an
official you know there was an official anything.
I think they all just knew each other.
And happened to be involved in some of this stuff and they probably all played their part
in it.
From my understanding you know it was the three of them it was Pieguy, Sherbinski and
Jigga that like were responsible for that.
Then from there you know the affiliation with Burner who was like rapping at the time and
you know did a lot of the promoting.
And it's weird because people will shout out Burner as like oh yeah thanks to Burner for
the cookies or whatever and it's like hmm not really.
If you want to thank anyone it's probably one of those three guys.
And if really if you want to thank someone you could thank us because they didn't want
that cut getting out.
They didn't want people growing it.
So if people are growing it you could probably really thank us.
Yeah. No I definitely agree on that point.
And that raises an interesting point in itself.
What do you think about Snowman the last remaining cookie cut that they feel hasn't
gotten out yet that they're still keeping under lock and key.
Yeah. So I've actually never seen it and I would love to see it.
I think it's probably something that I'd have to ask my buddy Straight Flame about.
I think he would definitely know more about it and my buddy Frost Boss would know more
about it.
I've never seen it.
You know I've heard things about it.
But to be honest I'd be curious to know like is it better than the Sherb?
Is it better than any of the Gelatos?
Like is it better than the cookies?
Because a lot of that stuff is kind of treading in the same gene pool.
So you know I just kind of feel like they're just on opposite ends of the cookie
spectrum. I would love I mean if it's like a gassier version of the cookies that might
be interesting.
Yeah. So sorry I was just going to say I spoke to Sharv 707 Seedbank and he's got an
S1 of it because he managed to buy a bag off one of the guys found a seed in it and
it's a pretty good S1 and he said it's just like a much more OG dominant version of
cookies basically.
That's what I figured. That's the only other thing that it could be.
And I remember yeah that I was going to say that I thought there was an S1 somewhere but
not I had never seen it.
So yeah I mean that doesn't surprise me.
I think if you wanted to do that though you know you could just reverse an OG to the
cookies and you would have that.
I don't think that it's anything you know.
I don't know. I just I don't know if it's game changing.
I mean does he sound very very excited about that S1 or is it just something that he's
like it's good but it's neither here nor there.
He likes it for sure.
But I think that kind of touches on the point you raised earlier in that you know at that
point is it really that different from Dosey Doe.
Exactly. Yeah.
Yeah. That's I mean that's that's exactly my point.
Like is it really anything.
So like if you had a male if you actually bred the cookies hit it to something like a
Vietnam hit it to something like a Burma hit it to something like a Guatemalan hit it to
something weird.
Now now we've got something you know like if you hit it to three different types of you
know totally different genetics and run through those.
I think that's how you're going to find something different.
I mean if cookies is kind of what I think it is which is just OG and cherry pie.
But what are you really doing that's that different.
Like yeah you know what's I mean what do you what do you really have if you're if you're
just hitting it back to an OG.
And so my next question on the cookies would be I think you might have a little bit of an
idea but if you don't that's fine.
Do you know much about the story behind the OG KB because what you find online is just
that supposedly the guy OG KB just is like I just got given it as
GSC. But like I feel like there's probably a bit more to it than that.
Yeah. So he's as far as I know I don't think OG KB has ever really spoken publicly
about it. So I definitely wouldn't want to put words in his mouth.
I know NorCal who is friends with him and you know I know as much as NorCal has told
me and the story of where it came from I can't speak to it.
I do know how how it got out.
I do know how it was given out but where he got it from I can't say.
And I think that he got it as a cutting.
I don't think he popped it from seed.
So I believe that he got that as as a cutting and it may have been from from that initial
batch that I think most of these seeds came from.
Yeah. Because they're very similar.
You know what what people call the thin mint and the animal and even the OG KB you know
the structure is completely mutated and totally you know in that way it's different.
The bag of peel the frost like the flavor profile is very very similar.
The style of the flower very very similar.
I mean all I know about that is that it was given to NorCal as a favor as a thank you
for a favor that he did for OG Kush breath.
And you know if he wants to speak publicly about about what that was at some point he
can. But I'll say that he did a favor for him and as a thank you.
He gave him that plant.
He NorCal gave that plant to several of us probably a half dozen of us.
Nobody kept it.
I kept it. Nobody else kept it because when we put it in the bedrooms it got laughed by
everything else. When we sent it into flower it literally got drowned.
I remember having to like lift it up to get it to like above the canopy where the sours
were and everything else. I mean it couldn't keep up with form.
It couldn't keep up with anything.
It veg super slow.
It didn't like to be over watered.
It was slow to root.
Nobody liked it.
Everyone let it go.
And it wasn't until probably about nine months or a year later when it started kind of
getting some traction that people started hitting us up asking for it back.
And NorCal's general response was well I've already gave it to you once.
No. I'm not giving it to you again.
So a lot of people didn't get it back.
And I think you know a couple of people got it and it is out.
You know some people have it.
But if you notice it's not one that people produce large amounts of flower of.
It's not one that you know that you see commonly on a shelf.
And I have seen certain producers in other states claim to have it.
And when I've seen the flower in the store it's it's not the OGKB.
It's just not.
So I've never actually seen it like commercially on a shelf.
Probably because of how difficult it is to grow and how long it takes.
But you know what's interesting is when you see it crossed with the with the face
off in the do-si-do it doesn't show that.
I mean it shows some of the mutant tendencies and you see that in like a peanut
butter breaths and whatnot because it comes out a lot in there.
But there's generally good plants to be found in there.
So it's a weird plant.
It's hard to pollinate.
I actually made an OGKB SFVNL at one point that I've never run those
seeds. It didn't make a lot of them.
It doesn't have a lot of pistils and this is a friendly piece of advice if
anybody does have it and is interested in pollinating it.
You're going to want to pollinate it way early and it just does not have a lot of
pistils. So it will not make a lot of seeds.
It just can't.
And you're going to want to you're going to want to adjust your feed.
You're going to want to adjust your lighting and whatnot to make it stretch a
little bit more and make it a little bit less dense so the seeds have more time to
fill in. And yeah it's a it's a really interesting plant.
Hard pressed to find an ounce of it honestly.
Like only really the only person I know still growing it is NorCal and
mostly for personal projects and whatnot.
Things that he's working on for himself but not really for commercial production at
all. Like I said I've never seen it.
I've seen it once on the shelf and it wasn't what they said it was.
Yeah. Yeah I've certainly never been able to try it unfortunately.
I would love to take a stab because I think I read somewhere I think NorCal wrote
somewhere the reason how he got that plant and maybe you can yay nay that for me or if
you prefer not to that's fine.
But what I'd heard was that OG Kushbreath had like a grow somewhere and he
was like about to be busted by the cops or something.
And like NorCal went to the grow and like took it all down for him and was like as
he's doing it like the cops could bust in at any moment type thing.
So very much in danger himself.
But he managed to do it and get it all packed up and so it was given to him as like a
thank you for that because that's obviously like a pretty hectic situation.
Is that roughly what happened?
That is yeah that is exactly what happened.
Yeah it was a favour for breaking down a spot and like you said you know anything
could have happened at that time.
He was at risk of getting busted there.
And so as a favour as a thank you for doing that for him he gave him that cut.
And that's you know I know they've always had they've always had a good relationship
over the years the two of them.
So you know solid I mean NorCal is one of the most I'll put it on record NorCal is one
of the most solid guys you'll ever meet in this business.
We've been friends for a long time a long time and very very stand up guy good good
person.
Yeah good to know good to know.
Okay so my final question directly relating to cookies for the moment is do you think
that there will be any repercussions on the cookie fam for the whole candy rain debacle
or do you think they're just going to slip by and nothing will ever really happen about
it.
I think they're going to slip by and they're going to pop back up again and they're going
to do something again.
People are going to forget that this ever happened.
I mean you've got to remember there's other people not at their scale and not at that
price point that have kind of had these issues and I'm not going to I don't want to say
anybody's name or whatever if you know if you've been in this you've seen there's a
couple of individuals specifically that have popped up dropped the whole line had it be
a disaster gone underground and popped up a couple of years later and tried again.
But the candy rain debacle I mean honestly people are such fanboys that I don't even
think they're mad.
If anything they they kind of set the standard for hey you know if you find one that's
good enough.
And I mean those packs you know they were significant amount of money.
People lost a lot of time and energy into those and clearly you know there was massive
issues with them.
And so I think people were just doubly upset in the fact that I don't really think they
ever responded to it publicly.
I think they kind of just ignored it as far as I know.
I think a big part of the candy rain debacle was yeah people spent a lot of money and they
couldn't even get them to germ.
But they don't want to say anything.
Yeah definitely.
And I mean a little bit of an insider scoop which may or may not be publicly known but
J-Beezy has 100 percent signed on to be Cookie Fam's in-house breeder from now on.
So we will certainly see some more stuff from them in the near future.
Yeah no I had heard about that.
Yeah no congratulations to him.
I hope they cut him a huge check honestly.
Yeah.
So I'm like I said I'm not mad at anyone getting out there getting it you know like good
for them.
If you can get them to cut you a huge check I think it's easy for a lot of people to say
oh I would never do that until it's sitting in front of you.
And then would you do that.
Yeah.
I was going to just say there's a lot of people making the transition into the recreational
cannabis market doing just that because they don't have the capital.
They don't have the access to the property.
They don't have the connections.
So they're going to they're going to sign on with someone who can who can take what
they've built and magnify it.
Yeah definitely.
Definitely.
And if and you know based on J-Beezy's work like you know for the most part he does pretty
good stuff.
Hopefully that trend continues in terms of what he does for Cookie Fam.
Yeah I don't see any reason why it wouldn't.
I think I think honestly I think it's I think it's going to be good work.
Yeah.
Hopefully.
Okay well to get off something a little less doom and gloom I do want to quickly run this
by you.
How do you feel when you see like kind of I don't say distant offspring but just kind of
offspring of the forum go on to reach stardom like the one that comes to mind is you trace
it back the GMO's got the forum in it.
When you see that type of thing and all the traction it gets do you get a certain sense of
kind of accomplishment from that or do you just don't really think about it.
To be honest I don't really think about it much but I always felt like cannabis had done so
much for me that there was really nothing that I could ever do to repay it.
And I'm going to be blunt and say something that people don't really seem to say like I
don't believe in the cannabis community.
I grew up where you know people sold drugs.
I grew up where people hustled like that's why I've always responded well to like Oakland
and the type of mentality that people have there.
It's a hustling mentality.
It doesn't matter what they're doing.
They're trying to hustle survive and improve their position.
And so cannabis had always done so so much for me.
I never really think there was anything I could ever do to like to repay it in general.
Like the I don't want to say the community because I don't really believe in that but
more and more just so like just the world that it cultivates around it the people that
are in the space the people that are in like tied into this plant and all the different
offshoots of it.
And so to see the forum cut get used in so many projects and just really and like yeah
and like you said to see the GMO blow up and a bunch of these other cuts that have blown
up because of it as well.
If anything like I'd say it makes me a little bit happy because I feel like I have the
chance to contribute to like changing the course of cannabis which how many people can
really say that how many people can really say that without this thing that they had
done that that they played a part you know in literally shifting the course of cannabis
on a global scale.
And you know with like you said without that cut making it to Europe and Mimico making
those seeds and then you know Skunk Master Flex selecting that cut and you know it blowing
up in Michigan before it ever blew up out here.
That was one of the first cuts that actually you know in a long time that actually started
in the Midwest and came west a couple years later.
It wasn't you know it was big there before it was really big out west.
So in a way I would say you know that it stokes me because to know that that would not
exist if we had not done what we did even as far as getting the cut to Europe.
Like if we hadn't done that Mimico would have never made the GMO and if he had made the
GMO then Skunk Master Flex you know they wouldn't have the Han Solo Burger and all that
other stuff that they've done with that.
So when you really look at it I mean a lot of stuff when you trace it back is from the
forum.
I mean even Sin City Seeds you know I want to say if I'm not mistaken I want to say it
was like Blue Power and Forum and they use that I think J Beazley used that when they
made the wedding cake.
And yes definitely.
Yeah.
So that also would not exist without that.
I mean there's a lot of if you really really trace it back it's kind of like a horse or
something where you say look at all these look at all the offspring and all the all
the all the different plants that are related to it that can be traced back to it that
wouldn't exist without it.
I mean to me it kind of stokes me because really like how many people have actually
had a chance to contribute to the cannabis scene at that level.
I mean you can talk about Chem Dog you can talk about a couple of these people you know
that I mean they were pivotal factors in these plants you know getting to where they
were going you know Bubba.
I mean the chems the Bubbas even the Sours you know all of that stuff.
And I mean with the OGs you know you can talk about Ghost you know the Ghost Cut and
some of that stuff at LA.
I mean if that stuff hadn't really gone where it got you know like a lot of the stuff
from you know from archive wouldn't exist.
I mean Face Off and all that stuff from you know from those guys down in SoCal and then
you know the doctor working with that and just it's in it's I'd say more than anything
I'm grateful to have had the chance to play a part in this thing.
And I think the biggest takeaway is like you are just a piece of this whole thing.
It's not nobody in this business and in this scene or whatever you want to call it
exists independently of everybody else.
We're all connected to each other in some way shape or form and some of us you know
have bigger you know roles that we've played.
More more has gone through us than other people.
More connections more networks whatever it might be have spiraled out from these things
that we've done.
But without you know all these people it wouldn't exist.
I mean if I had just given the cut to my if I just given the cut to my two or three
friends and they hadn't passed it out I wasn't going to pass it out not because I had no
interest in passing it just because I or because I was against passing it just because I
just generally avoided talking to people like in this business no good comes from talking
to people.
So just the more that you avoid people the longer you'll survive.
And that was kind of my feeling on that.
So if anything I would say that I'm honored you know.
It's funny that the GMO is actually one of the only cuts I ever asked for and they told
me they said yes but they never got it to me and they kind of just like left me on OK
whatever.
So I thought that was kind of funny because yeah that cut wouldn't exist without without
the work that I had done.
I mean I know True in the UK and in Spain has worked a lot with the forum as well.
He got that you know directly from our circle.
I mean a lot of people can trace where that cut came from back to people that were
affiliated with us.
So yeah I would say if anything you know I'm grateful and I'm honored you know to have
been able to shift cannabis in some way shape or form to have even been a part of it.
Yeah.
What a really awesome sentiment to express and that's so kind of coincidental you
referenced True.
I'm interviewing him in like 12 hours so there you go random.
Nice.
He's a cool guy I guess.
You vouch for him.
Yeah yeah.
Yeah he knows me from the forums from back in the day.
He was affiliated with some of our friends and that's how he got that forum cut which I'm
sure you can ask him about.
Cool.
You just gave me another question.
I love it.
But something you did mention which I you know a fan favorite of the show personal
favorite of mine Chemdog.
Let's talk about it.
The 91 the various D's.
What are your experiences with the Chemdog.
Do you like it.
Which one's your favorite.
Give me the lowdown.
So I love the ChemD.
The first chem I ever grew was the four and it was you know bigger yielding you know real
solid threw down really really well.
But people kind of had got tired of it.
That's actually one that I'm like bummed that I that I gave up.
I know some friends of ours in our circle still have it so I could I could get that one
back at some point.
But for whatever reason it's been like like the least favorite one out of all of them.
The D is phenomenal.
And you know you talked about the GMO and that's really part of what makes it special.
I mean the property well done is you know what what my what my boy calls blunt weed or
gangster weed.
It's like it's super potent incredibly tasty.
Does not does not have the best bag appeal in the entire world does not photograph super
well but is just amazing phenomenal or just raunchy beautiful or I mean it's what makes
the GMO like you know the GMO just got dressed up in a better in a better bag necessarily
or a better shell from the forum.
But really what really makes it is the chem D and then the 91 is a beautiful plant.
The 91 and the D are gorgeous plants in and of themselves.
The 91 being more OG which I just I just love it.
I mean I think it's an amazing amazing plant as well.
And you know they're a little bit fickle.
The D the D will do better than I do.
The 91 is a little bit more fickle.
But I love them both.
I think that they're you know they're staples in the cannabis scene in my opinion.
And I don't think that enough people have actually seen like you said all the various
D's and yeah there's the non variegated and this one and the other one.
We were lucky enough to get the D cut from JJ separately.
You know we had had it as well.
But you know when we when we got the one from JJ we said OK well you know this one is
definitely the one if there was any question there's not a question anymore.
And it's a phenomenal plant.
Beautiful. Love it.
I mean if you've tried the GMO I'm sure you've tried the D.
The way that the profile sticks to your palate you know it's really kind of like cuts
through anything else.
Yeah very very special plant.
And this kind of like a nice little segue onto the next question which is let's talk
about a strain that I think will become known as like the equivalent of the chem dogs but
for kind of the 2010 to 2020 period the Mac.
You know it's been so used abused you know all the rest of it.
What's your thoughts on it and do you plan to work with it because it's something I
noticed is surprisingly missing from your feed.
Yeah so I got the Mac initially like when when when people started kind of getting it.
I was pretty excited about it.
I was like OK this you know I've heard good things it looks good.
I grew it and I just wasn't impressed with it and I passed it to a couple of friends of
mine. You know people who've been you know people who I have in my circle and I've
shared cuts with for a long time and we mostly all agreed except for one of us we
mostly all agreed that it's not that great.
It looks good.
It has nice bag appeal does not really have much else going for it in my opinion.
I don't really care for the flavor.
I don't care for the high.
I don't care for the growth habit.
I don't like it. I mean I think Cap did a great job marketing and promoting and
branding it. I think he did.
I think he did a phenomenal job by saying don't give this to people who haven't
earned it. And in that way he kind of made it special.
I have seen a lot of the crosses from it.
And so to answer your question I have seen a lot of the crosses from it and they come
out very very like what I would describe as that Jack Lemony profile.
I think it's from the Colombian in it.
And that's not really something that I necessarily need to look for or would want
to look for. And it seems very very dominant in a lot of the crosses.
So for me not really something that I intend to work with.
I did make I think I made some Mac sherb seeds but I have not popped them and I
don't really think I have any intention to pop them at some point.
I guess if one of my friends wanted them I'd probably let them run it.
But from what I've seen it's not really a direction that I want to go down.
So I actually have a pack of the Mac that I bought you know in all honesty from the
first drop.
But it's one that you know I don't think it's going to stand up.
I think it's you know going to disappear pretty quickly.
I mean if you've noticed like there's not really a lot of hype left around it right
now although it's crazy at the events when when Cap is there the line is like 100
people deep or 200 people deep for it.
So all the crosses and this that and the other.
So I'll be interested to see you know one of my friends does love it.
I mean he he told me that I'm wrong flat out.
He said it's what he said he likes it.
But for me no I've got no interest in it.
And it's mostly just everything that I described about how it breeds and the
effect and the high and the taste all of the above beautiful plant though
photographs extremely well like a great Instagram plant.
If you ask me.
Yeah I would agree with that.
And the thing about the Mac which I mean it has been said before but I'll bring it up
again is it frustrates me how no one's talking about the fact that
no other serious legitimate contender keeper cuts
have ever been found from the seeds.
It's like it's almost like the Mac was pulled out of the aether
and then the seeds that are produced are almost different because there's yet no one has ever found
a keeper especially a male.
No nothing that I have seen come out of those out of the crosses
that have been like you know the authorized kind of crosses that he's done as well as some of the
work that other people have done.
Nothing has ever made any waves in anybody's garden.
And so I think that there's a lot of there was a lot of hype around it.
But just kind of looking at what's come from it it makes me think that
it's not really a it's not really a direction I would ever want to go in.
Like I wouldn't I wouldn't want to work it.
I wouldn't want to sell it to people.
I just I have no interest in going down that road.
I'll be interested to see if he keeps working with it.
You know I don't know if he's on to something else.
Perhaps he is.
But yeah.
Like you said nothing has really come from those seeds.
And you would think like I mean you know that can't the same cannot be said for Jay Beasley's work.
Like there's been a ton of work that people have found has been a ton of crosses the ice cream cake whatever all this
stuff that has come out since you know since the wedding cake stuff that people are you know people are like yeah man this is
really nice work.
I mean we have a wedding cake sherb that I made that's phenomenal.
I mean it's beautiful.
It's gorgeous.
Like you know it was hard to pick a keeper out of those out of those wedding cake sherb seeds that we made and ran
like there was a bunch of them that were just beautiful.
And I think that if I did the same thing with the Mac I think I probably would have killed them all.
So let's let's jump back to those sunset sherb crosses for a minute.
When you test those crosses do you find that this sherb tends to be quite dominating or it more lets the other parent shine
through.
So that's so one of the things that I've done which some of my friends have disagreed with is I tend to make a lot of crosses
sometimes and even if I don't release them or post them or whatever it might be I I like to do it.
And the reason is because I've noticed that when something so somebody might say oh the sherb is dominant and that may be
the case.
But there are pairings where it is not.
And I don't think that things are universally dominant.
So I don't think that if you reverse a sherb let's say and hit you know 20 different clones that there that the sherb is
always going to be dominant.
There's ones where it shines out and there's ones where it kind of fades back.
And I've noticed that in some different crosses we did a daigo walker to the UW and then we did the sherb to the UW and
the daigo walker to the UW the daigo was dominant and we did the sherb to the UW and the UW was dominant.
And so you know they both had the same UW cut.
They had different donor parents as it were and both of them responded differently to it.
So you know with the sherb crosses I mean what we see in like the wedding cake sherbs is that there are some that are
wedding cake there are some that are sherb and there are some that are 50 50 and I'd probably put them at about you know
40 percent one way 40 percent the other and 20 percent down the middle.
And the 50 50 ones are the ones that I'm always most interested in.
The ones that are more wedding cake or more sherb why would I select that way if I already have those cuttings.
So it just makes sense to me to try and find something where it pairs well.
In the case of the UW daigo we did select towards the daigo only because that grapefruit profile is something I really like and it
just was kind of a finicky less like lower yielding plant whereas the UW just throws down these big fat resinous colas on it.
And it's just you know it's hardy and chunky and you know veggies well and so selecting one like that with that grapefruit
profile you know was a real real improvement for us.
Yeah okay well I mean heck speaking of sherbet and grapefruit this seems like a really good time to ask in the past we had heard
stories that it was possible that the skittles cut was just a sherbet S1.
Now given your experience with sherbet do you think there's any possibility that could be true.
I mean no I don't think so.
And the reason is because we have you know run a lot of sherb and we've run a lot of sherb crosses and I don't think that the
skittles came from that.
I haven't really.
I can't say that I really thought much ever about about where the skittles actually came from.
I mean it was such a weird wonky plant that I never really had a lot of interest in it and I know it made a lot of waves as
well and people were really interested in it but it kind of reminds me of the lemon tree in a way where it's like this is not
something that like is like game changing.
This is something that's interesting but a flavor that I would be soon bored of if that's all I was if that's all I was
consuming.
Whereas with like a sour or a camera and OG you know that's something that you know I could take those all day and be completely
satisfied.
Beautiful beautiful herb.
I kind of put the skills where I put the lemon tree which it's an interesting flavor but I only want to see it as like 20 percent of a
cross as it were.
I don't really want to see it as like the whole thing.
But yeah to answer I don't think I would not say that the skittles was a sherb as one.
Yeah.
It's I mean if you've seen the flower it's just it's ugly.
It's like and it's not just that they grow it poorly.
It's that it's not really super high grade herb in that way.
It's very very tasty though and amazing for extracts much like the lemon tree.
Yeah.
And what I found interesting that you kind of brought that point about the lemon tree is I always find it very peculiar how
similar the terpene profile is between sherbet and lemon tree even though one's obviously more orangey ones more kind of more
lemony.
But I feel like there's this underlying similarity between the two.
Between the lemon tree and the sherb.
Sorry lemon tree and skittles.
Yes.
Yeah.
If you asked me if you said hey the lemon tree was an S1 of the skittles or the skittles was an S1 of the lemon tree which you know we all
think is just some lemon you know lemon from basically the Santa Cruz area that had been there supposedly for years anyway.
And that's not you know that's not an area I spent a lot of time in up in that up in those mountains.
But my understanding is that that's all the lemon tree is it's just a rebranded lemon cut that was you know popular in that area for a
long time anyway.
And if you told me the skittles was an S1 of the lemon tree that I would believe that would actually make a lot of sense to me.
That's another one where like there's never been a male.
There's no male skittles like that I've ever seen.
You could correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think there's ever been like an actual male.
They've crossed it with things and then they did like the ZOZ and some other stuff.
But I don't think there was ever an actual male of skittles.
Yeah I think you're correct on that one.
Interesting yeah I noticed that another kind of older strain from around those older days that I noticed on your feed was the Las Vegas purple
cush.
I'd love to know how did you get it because you don't you don't see a lot about it and people don't often speak about it but there are some
people who hang on to it.
So I figure it must have some value.
What's your take on it.
So that cut as we can trace that cut back pretty far within within our personal circle and the cut originally.
So so we attribute that the cut that cut to somebody named Hydra son who passed away.
He was the one that brought that cut into our circle.
He was definitely a character as most of us tend to be.
And he had sourced that cut from some people that he knew up in Washington I believe.
And originally another friend of mine who is super underground he was the one that actually got that cut for our friend Hydra son and Hydra son
brought that cut down to to Vegas and spread it to our circle out there.
And from there it spread it spread to some of our guys in the Bay Area.
I always avoided it because it grew like a bubba and I never liked Bubba at all.
I'd had no interest in Bubba.
I didn't want to grow it.
I didn't like the profile and the samples that I had seen of Bubba were kind of weak.
It was kind of after the Bubba had been grown kind of well and it was kind of getting commercialized and whatnot.
And so I just a bad samples.
I'd never really been impressed by it.
But that's a cut that I kept for a long long time.
It's a beautiful plan.
It's hardy vigorous very very resistant.
I think I think inspector or I think the doctor has come out back and forth here and there and said that oh it's a Bubba S1 or something or it's a weak version of Bubba.
And yeah for me I always thought it was a great plant.
I know in our circle it's always been very very popular.
It definitely spread from there.
Whether other people were able to get it through other avenues and maybe that's where they acquired it.
I know there's some people in the Midwest we've spoken to that have held it and grown it for a while as well.
I know that our circle and Hydro Sun in particular were responsible for spreading that cut.
It's like I said it's not a cut that anyone's going to have any interest in today.
It you know it doesn't trim up well does not have a ton of bag appeal.
It grows very very interesting potent flower.
But you know who's to say kind of anything beyond that.
I just I believe that it came out of a garden in Washington originally when we got it and then we spread it down to Vegas and I think that's where it took that name.
And then from there it kind of spread out.
But it is it's a cut that's kind of that's known but it seems unknown in a way as well.
I don't really know that that many people outside are like familiar with it.
So it's interesting that you bring it up.
Yeah because it's kind of one of those ones which does persist on but doesn't get a lot of mention does it.
No.
Well we've we've definitely kept it around.
I mean it has a place in our circle and I think people certain individuals have an affinity for it.
One or two people in particular that I'm thinking about that I think there are just certain cups certain cuts that they're going to keep probably forever.
And that's one of those cuts.
They just love it.
I mean grown grown right.
You know they've had good results with it.
I think one of my friends grew it in deep water culture which spread sped up the veg and increased the yield on it.
So you know he has a special place for it in his garden always.
And it's kind of cool to see it continue to survive and persist.
I've definitely done some work with it.
I've done an LVP case share and a couple of our little projects with it that I think you know a lot of that stuff.
A lot of the seeds they just go to friends of mine.
So and a lot of them they're not on Instagram.
They don't care about anything.
They're just they're just doing what they do and they just they just want to grow.
You know we all we've all just been sharing seeds for a long time.
I mean a lot of those sherb seeds I never made them available.
People didn't really have a chance to buy them.
They mostly just went to friends of mine.
Yeah okay.
Well I mean heck speaking of seeds I've noticed that you tend to make a good mix of both fem and regular seeds.
Do you have one you prefer most and do you feel like feminized seeds will eventually overtake regular seeds in popularity?
So yes.
So for years and years you know there was the common thought that like oh you know fems are unstable this that and the other whatever it might be.
You know that had kind of stuck in my mind for a while until we actually until I started seeing people doing work with them and then kind of seeing what was coming from it.
And I started to understand a little bit more that like not necessarily you know if if the work if it was done you know unintentionally or whatever it might be then yes you know especially some like the sours and whatnot.
But if you do it intentionally I do feel like so I've seen a lot of regular male female work.
And if you do a poor selection on the male you are kind of dooming that whole line.
Everything that comes after that is probably not going to be good.
And really the only way to know is to use the male grow out the seeds see what comes of it and then determine OK this is a solid male and then probably go back and do another line with them.
What I really appreciate about the fems especially you know like the clone only or whatever it might be.
Well I guess that term is kind of loose these days but basically like selected cuts versus you know just a general male or whatnot.
If you take if I take a sherb which people know and I cross it to let's say a Skittles which people know you're kind of taking the breeder out of the equation.
At that point what you're really depending on is does this person actually have these cuts.
And so for me going forward some of the work you know is going to be more more focused on the fems because I think that people really that's really what people want.
I mean a lot of people they don't really want to breed.
So if you don't want to breed you don't want to do the sex testing you don't want to identify anything you have a limited amount of space.
Some people stick to plant counts or whatnot and wherever they are they would rather just pop them.
They would rather say OK cool this is you know gelato 25 cross with do-si-do.
Perfect.
Like this will work you know and you know gelato and sherb or you know wedding cake and sherb.
You're taking the breeder out of the equation you're taking their personal kind of they're not able to influence as much the process.
So you're just saying hey basically thanks for having the legitimate cut.
Thank you for providing these seeds and I hope they germinate and then you know basically your service is done.
And that brings up a point you know for me as well which I don't know if it's something you were going to ask but a lot of what's going on out there right now it's people not working with legitimate cutting.
And I think that's one of the reasons that I've been able to do what I do is because people know that if I say I have something that it's that it is that.
And that's something that I've earned over a long long time in this business.
I think when people pop up now and they've got no reputation they've got no name they're not I'm honestly I hold Inspecta in high regard.
I was going to say you know like they're not Inspecta they're not these other people not to put myself with him.
But if Inspecta says he has a cut I 100% believe it.
So when he did those triangle cush s1's and people were complaining about the price I was dying laughing.
Because the opportunity to get a triangle cush s1 which took him multiple attempts to achieve from Inspecta is invaluable.
And if you can't see that then you know it's not for you.
Because you know that's a guy who if he says he has something it is exactly what he says it is.
And that's that's something that's like sorely lacking.
I see people popping up right now and they're saying oh you know I got the rumps or I got this or I got that.
Or you know something comes out and they already have a whole line with it.
And a whole reverse femme line to all these other ones and it's like who number one who are you?
Totally fine go ahead and get your money.
But number two like just like is it really is it really what you say it is?
And you know I think I think there's there's a lot of that going on.
But for me yeah I mean I intend to keep doing some male female work.
But that work takes longer and just like that as a zo.
People aren't really interested in you know people people don't people don't see the value.
Of working something two or three or four generations.
You're really kind of limiting yourself and from that kind of perspective.
People more want exactly what they know.
So if you say I've got a wedding cake and a sherb they're very into that.
But if you say oh I've got a Vietnam black tie with a grand doggie perp.
Cross with a grand doggie perp banana limon.
Then you have to explain all that to them.
You have to say oh the limon in cross was from swan song seeds.
And it's a double sour diesel shit trail.
And you know it's crossed with the banana but it's not the banana OG.
It's a Sonoma cut that we had.
It's like banana rumps almost.
And then you know we made that and then the grand doggie perp is a chem DGDP.
From connoisseur back in the day.
And you know you got to explain all this stuff to them.
And the Vietnam black tie is from ace.
And most people are going to be like who's ace and what is that and what is all of that.
Like where's the cookies at.
That's what that's honestly that's what they're going to say.
So literally if I just do cookies to cookies people will buy that.
You know fortunately for me like honestly I'm a little bit more difficult about selling
my seeds.
I don't really care if people buy them or don't buy them.
And that's not to be disrespectful of anyone.
That's just to say like I do what I do because I want to do it.
And because I think it's going to be good.
But when it comes down to actually selling seeds.
Why would you spend three or four years on a project when people are pumping out six
projects a year of just fems to fems.
You know I mean people are literally going to dispensary and buying a lot of 33 clone
and reversing it to everything else.
Or they're popping one pack of seeds from somebody else and just hitting a bunch of
stuff and just renaming it.
Saying they have this saying they have that.
And I think a lot of that is kind of what's going on out there right now.
But yeah for me I'm going to still do some fem work.
The fem work is tricky too you know.
And Inspecta I've been grateful to take some time from him.
You know it's not they don't always work.
I tried to do a high life reversal barely worked barely put out any seeds.
Very very very frustrating that when that happens.
And all you can really do is just go back to the drawing board and just try again.
You know and I know I know Matt Matt sells some solutions and one of my buddies Shafro
from People Under the Stairs.
He has another solution that he makes.
And you know we're toying with some different things and some gibberellic acid and whatnot
in the mix with the STS to see if you know we'll get the intended results that we need.
But you know generally it's not always the fems aren't always guaranteed either.
And so I understand you know like like that's why I feel like they can kind of command a
higher premium because and I think people don't understand that like what it takes to
back up so many plants like the commitment that it takes to keep such a diverse library.
There's a lot of people that are just going to the dispensary buying eight clones and
you know they start a seed company and that's great and that's fine and dandy.
They don't even keep any of the cuts.
They just go back and buy them again.
They hope it's the same cut.
You know maybe they hope maybe they don't care.
But to back up the sheer number of plants you know that I have backed up over the years
and that people like inspect to back up.
That's why I feel like they deserve a premium.
That's why I feel like you know it's worth paying them what they ask because of what
it takes to go into that.
You mean you're not just paying for you know somebody to make some seeds in a tent or something.
It's like this person has dedicated years to sourcing, collecting, preserving, transporting,
moving, you know cloning, backing up whatever it might be and then tried to do these things
for you.
But yeah I'm always going to do some regular male female work and some fem work.
I enjoy the fem work honestly.
A lot of people want that.
They don't care about breeding.
They have no interest in males.
Like they just want to pop some seeds, grow some flowers, pick a female and go from there.
Yeah I agree with just almost everything you said you know like that trusting a breeder
and not doing the kind of the shady acts that we see certain breeders like copycat genetics.
Fuck you Big Dan.
I hate you.
Yeah that guy's trash in every sense.
But yeah you know and someone like Inspector on the other hand you know the epitome of
kind of what you can trust as the gold standard.
So yeah I totally agree and we're going to talk about some Azazel stuff soon because
I'm super interested in that like above all things.
But I wanted to quickly ask you do you feel like when you're converting a female to be
like the pollen donor for a cross, do you feel like that causes any sort of stress?
Like do you feel like the result of you doing that is different from if the plant had hermed
out or do you feel like they're essentially the same result?
I feel that they're different.
In my experience the plants that herm out as it were tend to produce more unstable seeds
and when you intentionally do it, it seems to actually produce more stable seeds.
But I mean that could just be a matter of the plant that hermed out was initially more
prone to that anyway.
So maybe it wouldn't have had anything to do anyway.
Maybe if you had sprayed the plant that was going to herm out it would do it anyway whereas
the other one is just less prone to doing so.
I've never tried both ways to be honest but in my experience I think that if you do it
intentionally versus if it happens accidentally, I find it to be more reliable in my experience.
Yeah definitely I can back that myself with my limited experience making flowers.
And so the follow-up question is have you ever done any kind of more weird breeding
stuff with your regular things?
And by that I mean like we often refer to how DJ Short had many moons ago referenced
like that hermaphrodite males were good males to breed with.
Do you ever do any kind of left of field stuff like that at all or you try to keep it pretty
straightforward?
No I try and keep it pretty basic.
It's a very, very complicated game to play anyway and to try and complicate it even further
I would leave that to someone like DJ or some of these other people out there.
I mean the kind of work that DJ has done is not really the kind of work that I would want
to do.
Like I don't, the kind of breeding that he's done is different than what I'm interested
in.
For me I'm most interested in taking like things that are popular now and combining
them with things that are you know kind of out of left field that people wouldn't expect.
Like I did a Burma with the GB6 tricks and that's not something that anybody's doing.
And in fact when I made it Lowkey was, he even asked he's like nobody's gonna want that.
Nobody's gonna care about Burma or Lucy or any of this weird stuff that you're doing.
And I said it's fine people will grab whatever they want.
They'll grab do-si-do face on fire.
They'll grab this.
They'll grab that.
They'll grab the peanut butter breath.
Whatever it is they're interested in it's totally fine.
I do that because I like to do that and that's you know I enjoy doing that's probably about
as weird as I get is kind of combining some of these left field cultivars with something
that people would not expect it to be combined with.
Of course.
So when you are looking to select a male what are some of the traits you find ideal in a
male?
Like would you have any tips for the audience they love this type of thing.
It's like is there any sort of visual cues or anything that you like to go with?
Yeah so the first thing is that I look for is structure.
I like a plant that has what I consider ideal structure.
I don't want something that's too stocky.
I don't want something that has weird internodal spacing.
I don't want something I mean I have a specific type of plant that I look to make and it's
more geared towards indoor cultivation.
I want it to have a certain amount of internodal spacing.
I want it to have like proper size flowers.
I don't want I mean sometimes it happens but I don't want like just giant spear colas like
this you know it's not 1985.
I'm not trying to grow something to put my forearm next to it.
I want I like to grow what I consider like proper you know two three gram flowers like
on you know on a nice size plant.
So the biggest thing I would say would be structure, vigor, definitely like the leaf
like how leafy it is.
So when something is extremely leafy I think about like what it's going to be to maintain
that plant and grow that plant and at scale something requires if it requires a lot more
work it's just not worth it.
So I think a lot about that and then also when it comes time to flower them let's say
I've got you know 20 males I'm trying to flower I'll eliminate the first ones to show.
I don't want them and you know I don't know if that's something that other people have
touched on before but to me that's a sign that something is like a little bit more susceptible
to having intersex expressions a little bit less stable.
I want something that's going to show a little bit later and I want something that's going
to be a little bit more resistant.
So you know you can be a little bit rough on them.
You should be a little bit rough on them.
You should see how they respond and it's tough for me because I definitely don't like to
abuse them but I think it's important to see how they respond and to see which ones really
which ones kind of have the widest bandwidth.
So that's something that I think about a lot with plants is how tolerant they are and I
feel like that's something that we don't talk about as much like not all plants have the
same bandwidth and that's just what I call it.
They don't all have the same range.
They're not all able to take the temperature swings or the pH swings or the nutrient imbalances
or you know whatever it might be.
They don't all respond the same way and so I definitely look for plants that have a wider
bandwidth.
If the pH swings during the feed you know and these three don't respond well I'll eliminate
them because to me that says this is a plant that has that needs a really really specific
set of conditions in order for it to thrive.
That's a plant that I don't want because that's not what I'm looking for and I feel like it'll
pass those it could pass those traits on.
So why would I keep that plant?
So mostly I would say that's probably the biggest thing is just to see how they respond
to look at the structure.
I eliminate the early flowering ones and then you know I go from there.
One thing I've never done that I'm actually very interested in doing is to reverse a male
to see how it produces.
What the resin profile is like just a lot of those different factors and I'm sure you've
heard people talk about doing that before.
It's been a topic of conversation for years.
I know that some people have done it and I think that's a really interesting way to kind
of see which male would be worth going with and it's something I'd probably like to do
on my next project.
Yeah I think that'll get you some really interesting results.
We've heard a few people talk about it but it is still very much like a bit of a uncertain
thing that hasn't been delved into too much.
I did however want to ask you in general what are you currently working on?
What are you excited for?
Yeah so right now I'm trying to figure out what I want to do next.
We're seeing a lot of the results from the GP6 tricks project.
I had tried to do that highlife project which did not work out for me.
Not quite sure what I want to do.
I think we may take one of the selections from the GP6 tricks project to start a new
line from.
So one of the things we did was that we kept a couple of lines for ourselves and we didn't
release them.
One was the Gelato 41 GP6 tricks and the other one was the biscotti GP6 tricks and so both
of those haven't been released and right now we're in the process of hunting some of those.
Lowkey is hunting some of them right now and I've got a couple going as well and I think
if what we're seeing we really like and I think it would be an improvement to that line
and I think it might be a good foundation for a future FEM project.
I mean things are moving so quickly that it's kind of hard to say.
Me personally I would like to do something totally off the reservation as it were.
Like some Honduran or some Guatemalan or you know I've got a friend from Colombia you know
that got me some seeds.
I'd be interested in working some of that stuff but you know I've you know in conversations
with my friends one of the discussions we've had is basically it's just like yeah no one
is going to be interested in that and so there's the part of me that doesn't really care and
then there's the part of me that thinks well like I do it for me but I also do it so that
other people will grow it and so I have to consider you know what people want.
I mean if I just make something that is of only interest to a handful of us is it really
going to be impactful?
Is it really going to make a difference?
Are people really even going to grow it?
And if they're not if the answer is no then why make it or why make it at scale?
Just make it for myself then if I want and grow it out if I feel like growing it out.
But yeah I would say right now we're probably looking towards working on one of those or
probably a reversal.
I have a wedding cake sherb that I really like as well but sometimes I kind of feel
like maybe some of those things they've kind of had their time and a thing that I forget
is kind of how far ahead of the curve my friends and I have always been and something
that to us is kind of like washed kind of like over it as it were kind of blown out
still has a lot of traction.
I mean people still buy a lot of wedding cake crosses.
They still buy a lot of GMO crosses.
They still want to grow that and you know back east especially like a lot of the market
isn't even really there yet.
Like they're still excited about wedding cake.
And you know wedding cake is something that you know hasn't been popular out west in a
straight form for at least three or four years.
I mean it's something that you see but it's kind of like become like a staple.
It's kind of become like a thing that's around but not something that people are really,
really excited about.
So I think you know there's some work that could be done with the gelato 41 tricks that
I think would be good or the biscotti tricks.
I would like to work the Burma tricks potentially and the Lucy tricks and then maybe go back
to do some of the Sherb crosses as well.
Going forward though I don't know we talked about a little bit that Azazel is something
that I think has a lot of potential in it and everybody that's grown it has been really,
really impressed by it.
But it's one of those things where you know if you called it Apple Runts people would
buy it.
But if you call it Azazel I don't know that people are interested in it honestly and it's
how much further do I go down that direction.
Yeah okay well I mean let's talk about that for a quick second.
Do you like to kind of hunt and go down that route of things that aren't exactly popular
because like as what we see with the Azazel most people aren't specifically requesting
Vietnamese or Thai dominant weed these days.
Do you feel like as a breeder you've got to accept a certain amount of kind of commercial
loss or just you know kind of sales loss from the casual enthusiast but that then
in turn allows you to pursue some of these more niche and truly exotic lines?
I do feel that and what I find is that the people who are interested in my work are extremely
passionate.
So, I think that I have cultivated the right type of people for what I want to do.
But commercially it's not going to be something that you know like an Azazel or Vietnamese
or a Thai is not going to be something that necessarily is you know is going to make a
ton of waves.
However, that being said I mean when you look at the Mac it's the Colombian in it that really
surprises people.
And it's what gives it that profile that lemony profile or whatever you want to call that
weird how do my friend describe it like a raspberry yogurt or something.
But the lemon is what comes out all the rest of it all the crosses.
So, I think that you know I'm going to continue to do what I love to do.
I think that there is a group of people out there that appreciate the work that I do and
I do it mostly because I love it.
I've always done this because I love it and I've been grateful to be able to do that.
And I've always been the guy that instead of just running one strain I've run you know
a dozen and it doesn't make any sense to people and you leave a bunch of money on the table
and it's not efficient and requires a lot more work.
But I've always done this because I love to do it and so I accept whatever comes with
that which is yeah maybe you're not going to you are going to leave some sales on the
table.
I mean we did some GMO S1s and they flew.
It's tiny tiny drop super small you know but they flew and you know the vendor that picked
them up said that if I had done you know a bunch more of them they would all still go.
But a lot of the other stuff people aren't interested in you know if you do I mean we
did Death Star Cherry Pie with the Mendel Breath UV Wet Dream and you know people that
have grown and love it.
I mean somebody grew Chem 91 Mendel Breath UV Wet Dream that I made and you know told
me the herb was phenomenal.
I mean they loved it but it doesn't have what people want like nowhere in there does it
say gelato or syrup or cake or whatever or breath.
It doesn't have any of that in there.
It's something I mean I guess it does because it has the Mendel Breath but like very very
sparingly not in a way that people would want it.
So when you do decide to go down this route of exploring one of these lines which is kind
of more for your own interest than for a commercial success so to speak not that they're
mutually exclusive but you know hopefully you get what I mean.
Is it because you have fond memories of some of the components of these lines you're kind
of chasing that feeling of the old Vietnamese type strains or is it more so that it's just
a really interesting combination of things you don't see often.
To me it's literally because life is short and I have zero interest in trying to just
make a bunch of money and do whatever people expect you to do.
I'm going to do what I want to do and so if I have an opportunity to work something unique
and something different that's what I'm going to do.
And you know like I said the people that doing that kind of work attracts are the kind of
people that I want to be around.
I mean I've been really really fortunate to connect with a lot of really good people.
A group at New Mexico that you know super passionate about the work that I'm doing
and one of them is growing the Azazel and he told me I mean his description of it was
yeah super unique really really interesting you know shorter quicker flowering but it
has that Vietnamese Thai profile and that's something that when you show it to people
they haven't seen that.
They don't even know what that is.
There's a whole generation of people that I mean honestly most of them haven't even
seen flower.
All they do is dab.
So when you show them a proper flower of something like that it shows I think it could
change somebody's life to see something like that.
It could show them that there's more to this than just cookie cookie cookie cookie you
know there's like there's other stuff out there and I think that you know that to me
is valuable and the high is different.
The effect is different.
The terpene profile is different and I mean it's something that people nowadays don't
see like I was saying earlier you know a lot of the herb today is very very narcotic.
People are looking for something to basically be a substitute for a pill and yeah they can
find it out there but I don't to me it's not always about that.
I mean I've been I've been blessed to smoke some really really interesting flower and
you know the effects from them can be way way different and I don't know that a lot
of people have ever had flower like that.
Yeah I would agree it's certainly one of the rarer ones right.
Just not probably not last question but the one before you mentioned wet dream.
This is one I wanted to ask you about because I noticed the cult classics used it in some
of their lines.
Would you be able to fill us in on where you fit in with the wet dream and where they fit
in?
Yeah so the wet dream was a project that some friends and I had done.
We started it and I mentioned it earlier it was you know from reef and then we hit the
blue dream and we grew it outside for a couple of seasons and then I had had some that I
had flowered out.
I was going to try and do another I did I was on the F3 generation of it and I gathered
some pollen from it to kind of further the line a little bit more and I actually gave
it went down and saw my friend NorCal and gave it to him.
At the time he was growing the dog's waltz and I liked it.
I thought it was a great plant very very interesting and so I said hey I said do you mind hitting
the dog's waltz and making some seeds for me with it and he said yeah no problem.
He has a lot of stuff going on in his life so he had that pollen and at some point he
connected with cult classics because they they know each other and he gave him he gave
him the pollen or he sorry he gave him he hit the OGKB and he hit the Mendo breath and
he gave cult classics the OGKB seeds from that project.
The next time that I heard about that because we're all pretty busy somebody contacted me
and said hey are you working with cult classics and I said who's cult classics and he said
yeah he's got a OGKB wet dream line that he's releasing.
You don't know anything about this.
I said no I don't know anything about it so I called NorCal and talked to him for a bit
and he's like oh man I completely forgot that you gave me that pollen.
He's like yeah I'm working with him on this seed project and you know we're doing the
OGKB stuff and blah blah blah this that and the other.
I had never heard of him.
I had never met him.
I would not have given him my pollen.
This is a conversation that I have had publicly I think with him at one point and but because
NorCal is my friend and I figured he would you know get compensated from it rather than
cause a problem like what's done is done I just let it go.
I had a lot of other stuff going on a lot of other things that I was working on anyway
so it didn't really bother me.
Then just kind of like and I don't want to go too much into his personal issues but I'll
just suffice it to say that like they didn't necessarily it didn't really work out the
way that he wanted it to work out.
Not in all full transparency not an individual that I've ever wanted to be associated with
a person that I've met one time and I've never had any interest in further associating with
him.
I never got compensated on any of that stuff never had really any interest as long as NorCal
was getting you know compensated in some way shape or form.
Beyond that you know I've seen a lot of people run the work.
I've seen a lot of people be excited about it.
It is kind of cool to see that because you know what they're most excited about is usually
the fact that there's no intersex issues that have been found in those seeds.
The size, the vigor, the resin production, the profiles you know if anything I think
it's a testament to the work that my friends and I did over the years with that pollen.
That being said it was not ever intended for release nor did I ever have any nor would
I have ever worked with somebody like him.
It's just what happened and from there I would say at some point he did give me a couple
of the other OGKB wet dream seeds that existed and he also gave me some of the Mendebeth
UV wet dream seeds that existed and so I was able to you know keep those and I've used
the Mendebeth UV wet dreams in a line that I did and you know other than that I would
say yeah it's kind of cool to see it get out there.
He did a hell of a job with the branding and the promotion but just as a general human
being he's not somebody that I would associate with or would ever want to be associated with.
Unfortunately it's a common sentiment we hear in general when people have this type
of thing happen to them but I guess on the more above board side of things we see and
you mentioned earlier that you've been collaborating with Grow Loki in a few projects.
Do you plan to do more collabs with them going forward and do you see collabs becoming like
a more popular option in the industry going forward?
I do.
I could see people working together more collaboratively.
We do intend to do another project together so right now I think we're just kind of in
the planning phase.
Like I said if he finds something in this recent hunt or I find something that may be
the direction we go down.
We've shared cuts back and forth so there are some potential lines in there and then
I also have a huge you know collection of my own that I could pull from if I was interested.
So yeah we definitely plan on working together.
He's another one of those guys who's just a stand up person.
Somebody that I'm happy to work with and be associated with and you know he shared
that Trix with me.
That's a plant that he hasn't given to anybody else so it took you know it took a lot of
trust in him to give me that and to share it with me and to trust that I wouldn't put
it out there you know without his approval basically.
So I'm definitely looking forward and I do think that there is going to be a lot of more
collaborative projects going forward mostly because people are just becoming more comfortable
with meeting people and kind of being out there and so we're meeting people outside
of our immediate circle than we would otherwise associate with and you know low key was somebody
that I met when I threw a farmer's market event.
We actually threw the first cannabis farmer's market in SF and through a delivery service
that I had and he actually came out there.
He was super humble.
He came and asked about some baleen flower that I had been posting and growing and I
told him we were sold out because we were and he didn't say anything.
He just walked away and then he came back with my buddy Straight Flame and Straight
Flame was like hey man this is Grow Low Key blah blah blah.
I'm like oh man he was much smaller still at that time but I said I said hey I said
why didn't you say that you know why don't you say you knew Straight Flame or whatever
who you were.
He just didn't want to say anything but I you know I had a stash of baleen flowers for
all my friends and so I pulled out of there and gave him a bunch of stuff.
But yeah a good guy and just you know like I said people are starting to come out meet
more people.
I had a couple of friends that didn't want to come to that event because they were pretty
sure we were going to get raided.
So, some people are definitely getting more comfortable because since then a lot of those
events the farmer's markets and the sessions and all that stuff have definitely popped
up.
And so when you do a collab what's the ideal collab set up for you like do you like it
when say each person brings one parent to the table or do you think it's just a good
idea or do you think it doesn't necessarily have to work like that.
Is there a set kind of format you like or just whatever flows happens.
I think I think kind of whatever whatever happens I mean for me he had a really nice
plant to contribute and I had kind of the stable that we could pollinate.
He also gave me a couple that we could pollinate from his collection.
So, I feel like that was a really mutually beneficial situation for both of us.
I got to pollinate some cuts that were in demand like the Doves Garden Peanut Butter
Breath and obviously his tricks and whatnot.
And then he got access to a lot of my genetics which I had brought the Gelato 41 and the
Biscotti and whatnot to the table.
So, that's one of the definitely one of the positive sides of just being who we are and
where we're from is just having access to all the genetics whether it's the Runts or
the Gelatos or this or that or the other like we've always been some of the first people
to have those.
So, just being kind of first in space and then you know getting access to that and me
being able to contribute some things and him being able to contribute from his side of
the circle really worked beneficially for both of us.
I mean I have a project going with a friend of mine right now that I'm not going to get
into too much but basically I sent him some pollen and you know he's going to pollinate
something that's you know super in demand right now.
And so, we'll see you know people are interested or not interested regardless you know we're
always going to we're always going to keep doing what we like.
Cool, cool.
That's interesting to hear.
So, just to jump back to some things we were talking about before.
You mentioned that you know like ACE seeds that you've used some of their work along
with Connor.
So, let's talk about some of these older breeders who often don't get a good mention
like Connor is a good one because as far as I can see he's always done pretty good work
but doesn't frequently get a mention.
What was it that drew you to the Grandoggy perps and what's your general opinion on Connors
genetics?
So, I love the Chem D and the GDP.
You can't have lived in Oakland and not appreciate purple and then the Chem you know I really
appreciated the pairing.
I mean I had watched Connors and OJD and them working for a while with really just a nice
collection of UK varieties like the church and whatnot out there and also some of the
stuff from the states.
And it always just seemed like they were doing in the head.
He had interesting pairings that they were working and I know that him and true work
together and they had a falling out which I'm sure you know true may or may not speak
on when you speak to him.
But I always thought that they did interesting work and you know especially the perps and
the chems and I think they were one of the first ones to do a forum cross.
It may have been true actually that was one of the first ones to do like a forum cross
and actually publicly release it.
But I liked a lot of that older work you know Carmo is somebody who did a lot of older work.
He's still managed to stay relevant and he's moving definitely and doing some things out
here and got some of the older breeders that kind of you know are still out there ace and
them doing interesting work and Mosca is someone you know that he did some C99 work years ago
that was all really really solid old time moonshine.
Stuff like that that you know didn't really gain a lot of buzz but it was you know good
flower.
I grew a bunch of that stuff and I enjoyed it.
I feel like there was just there was more space back then to it's weird there's like
more breeders now but they do there's less variety in my opinion.
It's more people doing the same shit and less people doing more unique work.
I feel like back then there were less people but they were doing more unique work.
Less people but they were doing they were doing very very different work.
I mean there was always like the Dutch seed banks that kind of seemed like you could just
pick one and swap them for the other.
You know there was Sagamartha.
They were doing different stuff back then.
There was some peak 19 and a couple other things from them that were interesting.
But generally you know whatever Sensi or Nirvana or whoever it might be they were all kind
of the same thing at that point.
Even Greenhouse or whatever you know Greenhouse had some interesting work back then that people
seemed to like.
I didn't really grow much of it.
But yeah there was there was a lot of just smaller kind of more underground people that
were doing it.
I mean even OG Rascal was doing work back then.
People forget that OG Rascal did work like that back then.
Because he doesn't put seeds out now.
But you know I've definitely I've run some of his work.
He did Bubba Blue Moonshine and a couple other things that people just didn't see.
You know Head to Head was another one.
You know he had some Mass Super Skunk Sour D work.
Rez who I'm sure people have talked about before is another one.
You know whatever whatever with the situation and the whole story with him.
But you know the work he was one of the first ones you have to give credit.
You know he's one of the first ones to put a sour type plant out in seed form for people.
And you could grow the seeds and find something that was similar or better.
You know I grew Rez 4D Chem 4 with the sour or 4SD Chem 4 with the sour.
That was phenomenal beautiful herb.
You know to this day that's something that actually Prophet wants to work on.
I gave him a pack of the Chem Sours that I still have.
That was another phenomenal combination that he made.
Chem D with the sour in bread line that he was working.
So there's yeah there's definitely some older breeders.
Swan Song was one.
He was from the boards.
There was a lot of there's a lot of people that people are never going to remember.
And he did this Limon and a couple other ones.
And the Limon is something that I used in that Azazel.
It's a double sour diesel shit trowel.
And it's you know it's work like that that if you weren't around if you didn't know about it.
If you didn't really want it you were never going to see it.
It's not something you could just go and just pick up anywhere.
You really had you really had to want it.
You really had to look for it.
Yeah and I think some of the best gems are like that.
And that brings us to the next question perfectly.
You referenced that you know you've used some of Ace's work in your own work.
Would you in general kind of subscribe to the idea that with Ace you know they're
breeding with this really kind of untamed more kind of raw stock.
So it's inevitable that you're probably going to get some more kind of wild stuff.
You're going to have to put in a bit more of a hunt.
Would you agree with that sentiment or do you think it's just like most other packs
you know you probably find a keeper in a pack of 10 type of thing or is it a bit more involved?
I think it's a bit more involved.
It depends which of their lines you work with.
They have some that are very very open very kind of wild and they have some that have
been selected a little bit more with the mind of cultivating them indoors or at least you
know in a semi greenhouse environment.
I think the Vietnam black tie was an example of that.
I had plants that went you know 11 weeks 13 weeks 15 weeks.
There was plants that just didn't want to stop in there.
They were massive.
But I managed to work it and select an earlier flowering one and kind of tame it down.
But it takes some work and that's not something that people want to hear nowadays.
They would rather have a candy rain situation than to actually put the work in my opinion.
They want it done for them most people.
Most people do not have any interest in that.
But honestly that's where some of the most amazing most unique varieties are going to
be found.
I mean if you want to really make something game changing you're going to have to come
out of left field.
You're going to have to come with something different.
And I just don't know you know that you're going to find that in you know crossing gelato
with do-si-do.
Like I just I just don't see that happening.
I don't see how that would happen.
Especially like I feel like a lot of the older genetics are fading out.
So if you really really want something different you do kind of have to pull for something
from Ace or I know there's a lot of the people that have popped up over the last year or
two.
God I'm going to probably butcher it but I think it's like the Iranian like seed exchange
or something like that.
Those guys are out there gathering wild seeds you know semi semi domesticated some wild
you know.
But that's you know those are gems right there.
That's you know access to that work is really special.
And I know that my buddy from People Under the Stairs, Shephro has worked with some of
that stuff.
And there's definitely other people out there collecting it and growing it because they
they see the value.
You know I think they'll always be those people that want they want to grow something different
and something unique.
But they're not solely focused on cash cropping.
This is like this is a hobby for them.
It's not something that they're thinking oh you know I need to get two a light or three
a light and needs to be purple and able to put inside a Runtz bag.
They're not thinking like that.
They're thinking you know about a unique experience and that's what you'll find in the ace gear.
You'll find something different.
You might not find anything good at all.
But if you find something nice you're going to find something really nice.
I mean I'm stoked to have grown a bunch of those.
I don't think that there's a lot of people that could ever say that they have grown a
plant like that.
And I got to grow it and share it with my friends and show them something really really
unique.
You know and I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to do that to not be under this
pressure.
I mean I think about these commercial facilities nowadays.
The main ask is you know 20 percent THC X number of grams per square foot.
You know this number of days of flowering.
Plants get harvested when they're expected to be harvested on a schedule not not when
they're ready not not when they're ripe.
You know then they got to be tested.
Then they got to you know they got to get packaged.
I mean they get touched so many times along the way that by the time you get it it's basically
been abused.
The times of actually being able to go somewhere and you know chop a branch off of a line and
put it into a jar for yourself.
You know it's those days are mostly gone for people.
Like most people will never know what that's like.
Most people have never seen flower like that.
So how could they appreciate you know what really makes a special flower special.
Yeah of course.
Just to kind of talk about a different older kind of variety.
I noticed that you had worked with the super silver haze and that you'd done some crosses
with it.
Are there any other kind of older strains from these years gone by that you would like
to work with.
And also what was the cutting of super silver haze that you ended up using.
Was it one of the more known ones or just one you'd found.
No it's it's the known cut.
It's it's like the multiple cup winning cut.
That's a cut that we've had for a long time.
I love it.
It's a way to one that kind of has a I don't know a lot of people in our circle.
They don't really care for it.
They don't really appreciate it.
But I love it.
And our buddy Wadiz who you know grew it for a long time as well and won a couple of cups
with it.
He he loves it.
We love it.
People down in L.A. that get it through our friends delivery service.
They love it.
It's a beautiful beautiful cut.
You know I've tried I tried to hire a couple of people to do it.
I've tried to hunt some super silver haze from like more recent stock and I didn't find
anything worth anything in there.
So I always revert back to that to that specific plant as far as like newer or older varieties
as well that I'd be interested in working in.
I'd say I've mostly what I have access to I've worked with.
If I could get anything back that reminds me of you know something different it would
be there was a plant called lavender and it's not the Soma lavender.
It's it was a Bay Area cut.
It might have come at a NorCal.
I think it probably did.
And Mad Farmer actually works with it a lot and the Urkel.
And I to be honest like I've wanted to buy some of those crosses but me being me I just
want I actually just want the cut or S1s of the cut so that I could work with it in the
way that I want and not have it as diluted.
That's a plant that I would actually probably like to work with.
That's one of the first ones that I actually started with in the Bay Area when I when I
got that cut.
Beautiful plant great profile perfumey like resinous great full relaxing high to it just
a really really beautiful plant and that's probably one that I would like as far as any
of the older cuts.
I would say the Romulan if it existed would be something that I would be interested in.
The train wreck is one that I've always liked that I know that a lot of my friends are going
to listen to that and just shake their heads.
But I like it and you know I got to the Bay after the train wreck had already kind of
blown through and so I never really got tired of it because I never really had it to that
level.
The J1 would probably be one of those as well.
I would say the super silver haze is probably the oldest cut though out of all those cuts.
Before that not there's not really much else that I can think of that I would actually
be interested in.
I mean I know we've worked with some interesting stuff.
The haze like the piff is one that some friends of mine have worked with.
That's one that I would probably be interested in as well just because I would honestly like
to see S1s of it to run through to see what we find.
I think it would be a freak of a hunt.
And then beyond that I mean I know some friends of mine have talked about the HP13 and that's
one I actually just saw some flowers of that was very interesting, very unique, different.
You know there was a sage cut by Escobar that my friends have grown for a while.
That's a pretty interesting one.
It's not the sage from THC.
It's something else.
So that's a pretty unique one.
I mean those are really the ones that I seek out for my personal kind of garden for the
stuff that I want to do because really like you know like you said or like I was saying
it's like how many gelatos and dosidos and sherbs can we mix together at some point.
At some point it's just like really like if that's what you're looking for here we have
this and it's basically the same thing.
Yeah.
Yeah I agree completely.
So when you think about starting a new project is it all kind of based on feel or do you
really kind of think about it and if you do kind of put a bit more thought and maybe
kind of writing down your ideas and whatnot, what are sort of the considerations that come
into play when you are thinking about starting a new project?
So mostly I think about what the intention is, what the goal is and if like I'll give
an example is that like we have an orange sherb cut that Lowkey found.
It's phenomenal, beautiful flower but I don't want to do a whole line based on an orange
profile.
So I won't pick that plant as the basis for the project.
I think about really like what kind of gaps can we fill in that haven't been filled in
before and it makes me think about that's why I think a lot about those exotic pairings
because to just take like let's say we take this gelato 41 tricks and I hit it to the
gelato 33 and I hit it to the runs or I hit it to the apple fritter or whatever it might
be.
What am I really actually doing?
But for me that's how I feel and I know I've had conversations with some of my friends
and they say well that's what people want.
They want to see the mac or the wedding cake or the sherb or whatever they want.
They want to know both sides when they see it.
Me, I don't think about that as much although if I'm doing a collab with someone I do need
to consider that because that may be how they feel and so I'll be inclined to do a couple
for them the way that they would want them to do which may be more commercially minded
and I'll do a couple for me that I think are actually going to be more unique and a perfect
example of that is I did the green crack with the GB6 tricks and people had no interest
in it.
But I kept telling people like this is going to be a phenomenal pairing and a friend of
mine is growing them now and they're ridiculous and the same thing with the Lucy and the GB6
tricks.
99% of people have no interest, care not about the Lucy at all.
If anything like kind of like you may have thought when they see the butterscotch they
think oh is that from Canerado?
They might go that might be interesting from Canerado.
Nobody tell them it's a butterscotch Hawaiian and is you know from reefer man and made by
some guy named poor white farmer.
All of that is just noise to them.
They're not hearing anything that they there's nothing that sounds good to them there and
it's unfortunate because you know out of a lot of these plants like the Lucy tricks,
the super silver haze tricks, the Burma tricks, the green crack tricks, these older kind of
you know pre 2010 whatever varieties that were created by people with not a mind towards
commercial production.
Those are some phenomenal plants.
You know they're like the pairing is going to be really, really unique.
So, I think when I do something I think like what am I doing?
Why am I doing it and is it just repeating the same thing?
If I'm just going to repeat the same thing then like what is the point of it?
Just make more of the same?
To do that I'll just make S1s.
I mean if people really want that then just take gelato 41 and just make S1s and take
gelato 33 and just make S1s.
Just do all S1s.
You know just stop breeding at all.
Just make S1s and if that's kind of your thing do that but that's not my thing.
I want to make something that I'm actually interested in growing.
Like I'm excited you know to I'm excited when I see like I've seen the Lucy tricks
and it has the same butterscotch profile as the Lucy but way better structure, way better
bag appeal, much improved yield, like beautiful, beautiful but it has a distinct profile and
my feeling is that because this is being grown by a rec facility when it hits the market
people will not have seen something like that and that stokes me.
Whereas like yes people will buy you know gelato 41 tricks if we sold it to them but
they might not buy Lucy tricks but I think that if you can get them to try that flower,
if you can get them to try that concentrate like it will become something that they seek
out because like you were talking about the craft stuff it's unique and there's no denying
something that's different from everything else.
It stands apart for better or for worse it stands out.
So I think yeah when I do a project I think a lot about kind of just filling in the gaps
and kind of moving in a direction that other people aren't moving in.
I don't really honestly think about a lot of people.
I don't really think about what other people are doing at all.
I mean I should consider probably what the market wants but at the end of the day what
I have found is that there's enough people that are passionate about the work that I'm doing
that I don't need to consider the people who don't want it you know and if and like I said
if I'm doing a collab and they want me to do you know gelato 41 or runs or apple fritter
or something to involve those varieties in there we can do that but at the same time
I'm going to go and do my weird thing and cross this Burma that nobody cares about except
for maybe three people and it's fine because it's what makes me happy.
It's the seeds that I'm most excited about when I see a bunch of you know gelato 41 seeds
and whatever in my fridge it's like it doesn't really do anything for me.
I know they're going to be phenomenal.
I know they're going to photograph well you know I know it's going to look really good.
I know it's going to smoke good and it's going to have good flavor.
I know it's going to you know it's going to make people happy but there's a lot of other
things you know they could they could grow jelly breath or docilato or whatever and it
would probably do the same thing for them.
Yeah I get the sentiment but I certainly feel like you know man after my own heart in terms
of you know do your own thing and just make the weird crosses that you like.
I love that.
So the next question I would have is I've noticed that you've done a few crosses using
exotic mics work.
Where do you rate that because I noticed that you know exotic mic gets a lot of praise from
a lot of people but I've also had a lot of friends like people I know in real life I've
seen it myself they grow the gear out and there's a surprisingly large amount of Hermes
in the gear you know I'm probably going to cop some heat for that but you know where
do you find his work is this just an acceptable risk when you're growing out these types of
genetics and where do you rate exotic genetics in general?
Yeah so from from Mike I've used the cooking cream cut which is you know that that cup
winning cut and so I've used that one it's the hash monster people love that there's
been a lot of requests lately from people for for plants that will wash well and everybody
knows that that plant washes really well.
So I know that if we cross it you know the result will be just that as far as they like
kind of where I rate Mike and Mike's work one I've met Mike I've spent time with Mike.
Mike is a really really solid person it's like super humble really really good guy and
you know you're not going to please everyone in terms of there being some intersex expression
in the work I'm not surprised he works with a lot of different plants there's a lot of
cookie stuff in there even some of the sherb stuff and whatnot is in there and he does
a lot of male female regular stuff I think he's about to drop a feminized line which
would be his first one and so I think that you know from doing that standard male female
you run the risk of seeing some of that intersex expression.
I do know though that that there's people that are like super fanatical about his work
he's got a lot of people that find gear in there that they just love and it may just
be that that they find you know some intersex expression but they find some cuttings that
they're like yeah this one will work and then they run with it in that regard I think
it's fine Mike charges what I consider to be a reasonable price for his seeds so if
you're going to find some intersex expressions I don't think it's the end of the world because
the price is he keeps the price is very very reasonable if you charge a ton of money and
the work is unstable I think that's kind of where like I would draw the line personally
and I also know that you know he's definitely willing to like work with people I think if
people have issues and whatnot I don't think he has any issue replacing it or being communicative
like if he's had problems with certain lines which I don't know that he has had a huge
number of issues like as far as like with like the cookies guys where they just had to like
disappear and some other people that whatever I don't feel like naming right now where they
kind of just disappeared for a while and popped back up with a new line so I rate I rate Mike
pretty well and most mostly because just I've spent time with him and he could have a huge ego
and he could kind of be an asshole if he wanted to be but he's not he's like one he's one of the
most decent people you're going to meet in this business so that goes a long way with with me
like I said and I think he's pretty transparent with people about the work that he's doing.
So can we expect to see you working with any seed banks going forward and if so which ones
like what would be important to you about if you're going to be dealing with a seed bank
how would you want to go about establishing that type of relationship?
Yeah that's I mean that's tricky to be honest I don't really know that that's what I want to do
I've worked with one seed bank before in a limited capacity it's not really something that's like
kind of front and center for me I have enough people that are like interested in my work
that I don't really need to do that and I kind of am cultivating a different type of model
than other breeders like I'm not really looking to sell on a smaller scale to just like you know
all these different people and I mean that's that is what the seed banks do I do get requests from
people to list with certain seed banks but there there's some good ones and I've you know I've
seen some people that have worked with some of them before but it's not really something that
I'm really actively kind of seeking out obviously the biggest things to me would be just that it
they be stand up that they be trustworthy and they provide good customer service I mean the
last thing you want is someone having a problem with them that then affects poorly reflects poorly
on you for working with them and I'm sure you've seen you know there have been some some fly by
night seed banks or questionable practices with some of them you know in all kinds of ways whether
it's paying vendors or you know not not delivering the appropriate seeds or you know tampering with
the seed packs or all kinds of things that have happened out there over the years so there you
know there's some seed banks that friends of mine have had good relationships with I know my buddy
on non-profit has had a good relationship with seeds here now I know my buddy green team has
also had a good relationship with them so you know that's somebody that if it lined out it would make
sense but I'm not sure that you know the work that I do necessarily has kind of the commercial
profile that they might want and as far as like promoting I don't really do a lot of promoting I
just kind of post what I like and you know I just I don't really know that I would be a good partner
honestly for someone because I don't really care to promote a whole lot if you looked at my instagram
it's really just it's just me just sharing flour and kind of thoughts on things that I like and
mostly work that we've been doing or you know promoting some of my friends and their work
and you know just really kind of taking what we had on the forum and just putting it on instagram
not really trying to you know create a whole thing beyond that it's just it just kind of is exactly
what it is it's like these are the flowers this is what we're growing and I really use instagram
as kind of like a like a networking tool to be able to talk to other people about you know I
really like facility design I'm interested in environmentals I'm interested in lighting I'm
interested in a lot of these other factors and kind of just really improving that aspect of the
cultivation not so much for like you know buy these seeds and they're going to be here and
they're dropping here it's a lot of work to do all that it's a lot of time and a lot of commitment
I find that I have better relationships with some of the larger farms and enough of my friends kind
of run these facilities that I don't you know they understand my work they appreciate my work
and so being able to just kind of work with them enables me to still do what I want to do without
having to kind of deal with things on a smaller scale because there's a lot of blowback that comes
from also the people I don't think people think about that I think they just are excited to work
with a seed bank they don't think about okay the customer service they provide or you know this
person this one person had an issue but you're dealing with hundreds of people or thousands of
people so you know there's issues that pop up and kind of like you said people have had issues with
certain breeders and whatnot and then it becomes like a whole online thing and it's it's more
energy than I'm than I think I currently want to you know extend in that direction if somebody
wanted to do like like a small amount in a limited drop or something I would be inclined to do that
but not really like a full commitment to say like yeah I'm going to keep promoting and do all that
stuff I've seen people kind of get upset with with seed producers too for not promoting and not
tagging them properly and reposting and all I don't I don't want to get into all that it's a
big it's just too much to me would mostly be like hey if you like my work great you can carry it
if you don't care to carry it don't carry it it's totally fine and yeah but I know like I said I know
a non-profit has had a good relationship with seeds here now and my buddy from green team as
well and a couple other people that I know so probably would lean would lean towards working
with them if that was the case. Yeah cool I mean it makes sense right so I think we're now on to
our last couple of questions before we get to the rapid-fire ones at the end so a pertinent
question I ask all the guests what is your preferred style of growing and by that I mean
are you an organic or more of a synthetic guy how do you do it? So for outdoor cultivation
I mean number one I when it comes to like the organic versus synthetics I don't really draw a
hard and fast line I think there's products from both sides that really make sense I know there's
people running like no till or low till organic gardens with amendments and worms and they leave
the leaves and they do all that and that's dope but indoor that never made any sense to me I grew
up indoor cultivating so to me it's always been you know initially was bottle nutrients and then
it was salts just to be able to get the cost down and at the end of the day like I never really
noticed a huge decrease in the quality I have done like fully organic like amended soil and you know
I actually like to do that for pheno hunts I think it really gives the plants an opportunity
to pull what they want from that but when you try and maintain this soil and do all that and it's
indoors it kind of becomes a pain you need a lot more space. Outdoor yeah the organic soil like
fish emulsions all that stuff I've always been a big proponent of that style of gardening for the
outdoor plants I think that they love it I think there's really something really really special
about being able to cultivate outdoors I love it that's definitely something that you know that I
appreciate about having the chance to spend in NorCal is all those years being able to grow
outdoors in spite of the fires and everything else for indoor I definitely prefer cocoa usually is
the preferred medium I have a lot of experience in rockwool as well rockwool is just cleaner
but I kind of like I appreciate cocoa I find it to be kind of like an in between
like rockwool or some kind of you know soilless medium or you know I don't know amended soil or
whatever it might be a pro mix or whatever that might be with peat and whatnot so I would probably
say my favorite over the years has been cocoa I find that you know I can grow really large plants
in there multiple irrigations per day and for years and years and years it was house and gardens
house and garden nutrients which I really appreciated and you know now I find you know
you can use flora flex you can use veg bloom you can use all of these products
really a lot of people and this is friendly advice to anyone who's listening a lot of people
are getting taxed on their nutrients at the end of the day the nutrients are just one component
you can't buy your way out of hard work so all the equipment all the tools all the fertilizer
whatever you're spending all this money but if you're not actually doing the work I would take
a low-tech garden with hard work over a garden with all expensive bottle nutrients and whatnot
it's just it just doesn't make any sense if people are listening don't pay for water buy salts if
you're going to do that and if not buy amendments and mix your own soil yeah really solid advice so
do you have a favorite product you'd like to plug it all um that's a good question I would say as far
as a favorite product um I don't really think I'm loyal to anybody at this point I mean there's some
lighting companies that are pretty decent it's I mean god I don't I honestly don't know I mean I
would say uh man yeah I really don't know I mean there's there's some products that I've used but
no one that I would really recommend off top I would tell people you know to avoid Govita
um I can tell people what to avoid more than anything do it do it yeah I would say avoid
Govita avoid avoid advanced nutrients um avoid water-based nutrients if you don't need them
like literally don't buy anything that's that's mixed with water buy floraflex because it's cheap
if you want uh foliar if you need to um to supplement it um look at what the agriculture
industry is doing and that's you know stop buying something just because it has a fancy package on
it I mean JR Peters has a product called stem very inexpensive tons of micronutrients but if it was
bottled by advanced it would cost like five times as much ten times as much um yeah I would say you
know look look into the LEDs and you know compare they compare the different technologies that are
out there there's a lot of people on Instagram right now giving a lot of good information
on LEDs and you know feel free to reach out to the people and ask and learn you know and see
learn you know about the value of an adjustable spectrum light and look at you know the CMHs you
know and consider consider you know how you're operating your garden how you're setting it up and
um yeah cleanliness you know probably if I was going to plug a product it would probably be
bleach or something of the sort because cleaning is fundamental people do not want to clean they
seem to forget that we're basically like housekeepers and janitors for plants at this
point so keep it clean and um yeah I don't know I would say there's there's definitely companies
that are worth avoiding out there that would not be worth messing with and um yeah yeah I don't know
good call so just to wrap up our kind of growing questions do you have any growing tips for the
listeners or I guess maybe more specifically do you commonly see people making certain
mistakes with growing what's the mistake you see people commonly doing um common mistakes
overfeeding is a common mistake trying to buy their way out of out of a problem that they created
um there is no solution to hard work pay attention be diligent don't do something when it's convenient
for you do it when the plant needs it when you build your systems and you are designing a space
consider all the various factors think about where you're going and not kind of what you can afford
right now and where you are and so as you design as you buy as you build think about all of that
and prioritize the plant like I said no amount of automation no amount of cameras or sensors
for this that and the other is a replacement for actually having experience with the plant
I mean there's a lot of people that have you know horticulture degrees
whatnot they think that they know better than the plant they think that they can look at a chart
and or meter readings and this and that and the other and that's that's that actually is what's
happening it's not when you look at the plant if you can't tell what's happening you have not spent
enough time with it I mean I can if you walk into a room and it feels wrong if it smells wrong
if the leaf feels wrong if the if the structure on the leaf looks off if the general like the general
shape form or kind of like the stance of the plant is off something is wrong in your room um and I
think a lot of people they over light their gardens they overfeed their gardens like they do
too much and pay attention not all strains are the same not all cultivars want the same thing
so think about that when you're setting up your garden if you want to design something to be able
to grow multiple different varieties make sure you can have different feeds on each bench or each table
um and keep it really really clean you know I think a big mistake that people make is like
they you know I mean you're only going to get what you put into it that's all you're going to get out
of it if there's no like I can tell when a person has neglected their garden and I've had people
watch my garden before and I can tell like they just watered it right before I got back
and the plants you know have a little bit of curl on the leaf or a little bit you know they have a
little they you know they're going to dry back and they're going to burn and I don't care what they
said I know I know exactly what they did um but yeah my biggest advice would probably be just
you know don't be afraid to experiment but don't change too many variables at once either
like you won't know what actually caused the effect be patient and think about what you're
doing think about whether or not you're trying to learn to cultivate a specific variety think
about whether you're trying to get experience with different equipment think about you know
whether you're happy with you know b-grade buds and when it comes down to harvesting and drying
and curing like give it the attention that it deserves when you run something and put that
much time into something and you don't cure it properly you don't store it properly like
you're wasting your time you're never going to see the full potential of that plant
and um yeah I would just say just you know be diligent be thoughtful and pay attention you know
care and the more you care the better the better your garden will turn out and don't be afraid you
know to ask questions don't be afraid to reach out to people you'd be surprised especially nowadays
how helpful some people will be like I'm not saying that inspector is going to answer your
message if you ask but he might and you know I think a lot of people too they they want to
they want to be great they're afraid they're afraid to make mistakes and understand that
all of us made mistakes all of us have ruined a bat's all of us have flooded a room or you know
inserted a bulb improperly or whatever it might be all of us have done it and we've done it multiple
times um and be diligent with your ipm be diligent if you if you think it doesn't matter
and you start taking a day here a day there and skipping this or skipping that I promise you it's
going to bite you and it's going to be months of cleanup and you that little bit of time that you
neglected is going to come back to bite you in the ass every single time you can always look back and
see where you were lazy and it will come back and bite you yeah some phenomenally solid advice
right there for all the growers looking to improve their game a bit so last question before our
little quickfire round we can see that there are more and more states coming online regularly and
we can also see that it's really hard to find good flower in the majority of these states
like for example you know in on the east coast in places like mass like I can only think of like two
people where I'd be able to get good flower from them and that's like mass medical and then like
chem dog slash that guy from main those guys are obviously crushing it so I guess my question is
for people who are from these smaller states just coming online it's really no established scene and
I know I know that mass has a bit more of an established scene than most places but
I digress if you're from a state where there's less of an established scene it's hard to find
good flower what are some tips for the kind of communities in these places to just lift their
game and produce better quality flower and get up to scratch with the west coast for example
well I'm gonna have kind of a defeatist attitude I think about the recreational market at least out
east for a while this market is going to be dominated by by the big players by the people
that have the deep pockets so if your goal is to try and produce a higher grade quality flower
I honestly think that the best you could hope for is probably like a cheesecake factory level
of flour where it's good but anybody who knows something phenomenal something truly special will
never be impressed by it and the the big reason why is because of everything that goes into it
in terms of how it's harvested how long it sits it goes out for testing then it gets jarred up
then it goes and sits on the shelf there's just such a gap in between that scene and when it
actually hits the market that the flower is just going to be like degraded by the time a consumer
actually gets it so if you're used to getting something really phenomenal high end it's going
to be really really tough as a producer there are states that are more friendly I think Maine is one
of those states that seems to be that like smaller producers can kind of get more into the market
there so that might be worth considering I do think that you know try I mean if you really really want
and you're really really committed to actually producing for the market like on the recreational
side you're gonna have to raise some capital and try and make a run of it and be willing to fight
tooth and nail for you know three four or five years and I don't know that there's a ton of
people that are willing to do that because the biggest producers on the medical side of the
market they're not going to want to make the transition a lot of people I saw that happen
in California not a lot of people have transitioned successfully through 64 a lot of people disappeared
a lot of people are not made to exist in a corporate structure they're just not built for it
it's a whole different beast of a situation and I also think to be completely blunt like the
amount that people get paid by these facilities is not equivalent to what they were earning so a lot
of a lot of the most talented growers are not going to want to work for these facilities and
I guess a big thing is that like if you are a grower are you capable of operating in a semi
corporate environment because whether you like it or not that's what you're doing you know you're
analyzing costs you're managing people you're dealing with you know unemployment and payroll
and all of this stuff that that's not why a lot of people got into it so I think you know I think
in a few years after all of this settles there will be an opportunity for some of these smaller
craft places to pop up and you know I'm very very much looking forward to that because I just don't
think that it should cost that amount of money to and require that much security and that much
tracking and all of these crazy things to be able to you know grow an eight lighter and you know have
a small I mean the equivalent of a small craft brewery it just it shouldn't it shouldn't be that
much different from that in terms of you know they don't have to have security in front of their
spaces they don't have to have cameras in every corner they don't have to pay all these exorbitant
taxes and they let them pop up pretty much anywhere you know for for us you know it's hard I think for
a lot of guys to make that transition for a lot of people to make that transition if you can get
enough people on the same page you can try and make a run at it but if you're looking to produce
higher quality I mean I don't honestly think that we're going to see the level of the quality of
flour that we saw in the medical days in California on the rec market for a long time I think best
case scenario a lot of the flour that's on the market is b-grade I think a lot of the oil that's
on the market is better because the oil is processed so quickly and then it doesn't get
it's more the BHO that they're making in California is an example from the fresh frozen material it's
a lot easier to preserve it and bring it to market in a stable state where it still has a really
really strong terpene profile and still has a nice solid effect if the flour isn't stored precisely
all along the way before you get it it's going to be an inferior product I mean I've seen shops in
Oregon like that where it's you know it's 80 degrees in there and they've got the jar sitting
there in full light and when you ask them you know if they understand about oxidation and
temperature and the terpenes you know and they don't they had no clue what I was talking about
so I think that you know for the quality scene on the east coast I think that there are people
producing quality flour but I think a lot of them are going to stay medical a lot of them are going
to stay underground and I think there probably are some facilities that are trying to produce
higher grade flour but at the end of the day a lot of the people that are bankrolling these
facilities that's not really what matters to them they're just looking to grab market share make
revenue you know they just want to recoup their investment and potentially flip their business
hopefully you know California will see some brands that survive and exist I know some people out
there that are doing you know that are fully intending to do good quality work and I think
if a market could sustain that it would be a larger market like California. Yeah of course
and you just raised a really interesting point that I want to touch on for a second there
have you ever met a bud tender who legitimately impressed you with their knowledge?
Oh wow no um right even at yeah even at archive I've met some people that were like knowledgeable
you know and they were pretty passionate but nobody that ever really impressed me with their
knowledge and this is no disrespect to anyone but if you knew that much about this if you were
that passionate about this like is that really where you would be? Yeah like the reason why I
bring it up is because I got sent an email and there was some like event like for is like the
bud tender awards or something and they were like oh would you would you like to come and document
it and obviously they don't realize I'm in Australia but more importantly like all I was
thinking to myself is like what would I be documenting like the mediocrity like I like yeah
like I've I'm disappointed by bud tenders consistently it's like just the most passe
thing to do if you're superficially into cannabis. Yeah I had I had to explain so I went into one
dispensary I had to explain to them I asked if they had any live resin and they said oh we've
got this and I was like well that that's co2 and they were like oh but yeah but it's live I was
like no no like I said that's not what I'm asking about I said do you have any like fresh frozen
material like bho extract I'm like that's the only way it would be like that and I had to explain to
them the difference and then one of them asked me hey you know you know you know a lot about
cannabis would like do you want a job here and I'm not not to be rude I laughed um but not not
like that but only to say like no like this is my life is my whole upset I don't have to get into it
with them but like you should know that you should know the difference between live resin and butter
and sugar and wax and bho and co2 it's really not that complicated like all you need to do is care
to educate people but the reality is like I said about the companies that are running these places
the bar is so low they pay so little they care so little about the training and kind of helping
build these people up just like most companies they don't really care about building up their
employees why would they care so they you know unfortunately most people that come in what if
you've listened all they say is what's the highest THC thing you have for the least amount of money
that's literally what people are interested in like yeah that that's it you know the test results
are a whole nother thing you know that's like I mean some states are more strict than others but
at the end of the day you know there's been stories you know out of Washington and other
places with labs completely faking test results and it's kind of unfortunate like we live in a THC
kind of dominant society people really just only care about the majority of the customers that come
in just care about the THC level you know and if it's 30 it sells faster if it's 25 it sells fast
if it sells 20 great below 20 they're not super interested yeah it's it's interesting right I
remember hearing that one of the testing companies I can't remember who it was not even if I remembered
I probably wouldn't want to say the name but that they were like you know you'd pay for the test and
then you'd also pay a little extra fee if you wanted it to test over like you know 26 or
something I was just like oh yeah cool cool oh yeah oh yeah that's I mean people people have
shopped around for testing companies like to see who will test higher because they know that they'll
get a higher ticket for that yeah that's really interesting but also sad but not unexpected given
where we're at anyway on to our last little run of questions what I like to call the quick fire
questions so these ones you know feel free to answer them as quickly or as long as you'd like
first one what's your favorite weed that you've ever smoked wow probably this the
cali mist we used to get in San Diego in like early 2001 2002 wow yeah that that sounds like a really
nice throwback yeah it was phenomenal it was beautiful you could smell it in the air no matter
if somebody was smoking it wherever they were smoking it you could it was distinct
it had an incredible high that was super clear you felt lifted but clear no no tiredness no
anything to it really really beautiful and then the other one was honestly some some Willie Nelson
that they had at Harborside I used to vend to Harborside and I went in there one time and they
had bought a pound of it and I got I think they paid like six or seven thousand for it at the
time and when pounds of sour were going for 36 34 significant but they gave me some of it and the
high from that was phenomenal I mean really really really special flower it never made the shelf they
split it up amongst themselves back there interesting stuff okay so on the opposite end of
the spectrum what's the worst weed you've ever smoked and the follow-up is what's the worst
weed that you've smoked that somehow got commercial traction and other people seemingly
thought it was pretty good wow the worst weed that I've ever smoked was probably the brickweed I
smoked in Miami when I was like 16 um since then I've been like no I won't do that um the worst
weed that's gained commercial traction is probably the mac or the purple punch either one of those
yeah two two contenders that we've heard before actually no we haven't heard the mac we've heard
purple punch but there you go a new one bringing mac to the the worst commercial one but I see
where the merit is so the next one is if you're stranded on a desert island you can only take
three strains with you what three are you going to take
three you're going to take
wow probably the chem d uh probably the tk and
probably like the lavender um or some something along that line of the old perps I'd probably
say because that would I mean I'm gonna miss the sour but I think I think if I combine the 91
and the uh or if I can buy the tk and the d I could probably get something that I like in there
love it and you just wave goodbye to sativas at that point
hey I'm on an island everything's gonna be fine yeah lovely okay so the next one is if you could
have back one clone that you had lost or a clone that you'd wanted but were just never able to get
your hands on what one would it be wow um
um probably that lavender honestly I just have a fond space for it I've never haven't had anything
like it in my garden since it would probably be that that lavender yeah it's a really special
plant I've been lucky enough to be able to smoke some grown out by duke and it's uh very very
memorable nice lucky indeed so on to our very last question if you could go back in time to
any place any time frame throughout all of history to presumably get some seeds or a clone
where and when would you go wow um
man
hmm
probably colombia I think I think that a lot of interesting work has come out of there
and it would have to be before we started traveling around the world and
polluting the genetic gene pool um probably some of the colombian and if not
if not the colombian some of the asian stuff like something something out in thailand
or cambodia or laos I think would be really really phenomenal flower all things being equal
so I'd probably aim aim towards one of those both kind of with the same intention really
looking for something with an incredibly like psychedelic uplifting type high
yeah fantastic sounds like something I would consider doing so with all that being said
do you have any shout outs or comments you'd like to make um I would say if anything I just
want to shout out all my friends I really appreciate them I'm super grateful for everything
that they've done for me over the years um a good friend of mine who really helped me a whole lot
when I landed in Oakland and didn't know anybody and didn't have anything and really looked out
for me and knew a lot about growing knew a lot more about growing than I did at the time and
now you know he calls me for advice um but still one of one of my greatest friends and I super
appreciate him and then my buddies from ICMAG who I would not be here without um my buddy Stoney
my buddy Frost Boss my buddy Prophet my buddy NorCal my buddy Deezy um just all all the people
that I kind of came up with and that made opportunities for me and gave me a chance
when I was just trying to make a run of it out west a lot of these guys were born and raised out
here and you know they didn't have to extend any hospitality or do anything of the sort but
they definitely gave me a lot of opportunity and a couple of my friends from Chicago
um who were basically the reason that I thought that this was possible and were the ones that
it convinced me to come back to the west coast after I tried the first time and it didn't work
out and gave me an opportunity and kind of just plugged me with with the right people and you know
were always there to kind of help me even when I couldn't afford to pay them um just really you
know super grateful and honestly for my mother and my grandmother who in spite of me being
completely insane in their eyes have always supported me and encouraged me and never told
me that I was incapable of doing something and that's probably the best advice that I would
give anybody who's actually taking the time to listen to this is that you are completely capable
of doing it if you of whatever it is that you want to achieve if you're willing to apply and work and
single-mindedly focus on something and be be good people don't let people take advantage of you and
give give what you get some really really really really solid advice there so just again a big
