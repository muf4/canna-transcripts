In this episode, we're joined by the one and only Leo Stone of Aficionado Genetics
to talk all things high-end brands, top shelf bud and strain history.
Let's get into it.
All righty, so a big hello and welcome to the mastermind behind Aficionado Genetics.
Thanks so much Leo Stone for joining us today.
Thanks a lot, I really appreciate it, man.
No worries.
So, first question, what are you currently smoking on?
We haven't named it yet.
It's a cross between Cherry Noir, which was a collab that me and Gene and I did back in
2013.
I gave him mail from my, pollen from my ChemDog Special Reserve mail and he put that on one
of his cherry limes.
That plant ended up becoming the mother, one of the selections from those seeds ended up
becoming the mother for the white cherry truffle.
So we took that mother and we put a Testerosa mail on it to see where it would take it.
It took it in an entirely different direction.
So I've been smoking on it for a week and I've been talking to Professor Q, who's my
partner and he lives in France right now.
So I'm telling him, he's like, man, what the fuck are we going to call it?
We have a working title for it, but it's like, we don't know what we're going to name it.
It's just, it's a new flavor we haven't, we have yet to come across.
So we don't want to give it some generic ass name.
That's not going to give it some justice.
Yeah.
Okay.
Oh my gosh.
There's so many questions I want to ask and I'm going to forget a bunch of them.
I guess the first one in the most kind of recent thing you mentioned at the end there
was the idea of giving relevant names to strains.
I've always felt like this is an important point.
Like, you know, someone made a point in the past where they were like, oh, you go give
some awesome name to a strain and then it turns out to be a shitty strain.
Like, yeah.
What do you think should be our conventions around naming strains?
Do you think people should put an effort into trying to make like, you know, name it after
something?
Yeah.
It's like, uh, I think, you know, it's, it's the identity of the strain, you know?
And if you go beyond that and you go start like, you know, we're breeders and you know,
your job is to make strains connect with people and you have to market those strains so you
connect with people.
And so, you know, we really approach it, it's, it's a lot like music to us.
You know, it's like the, the, the, the name of the album, the name of the track has to
fit the song.
And so it, you know, in our case as being breeders for us, it's like the name really
has to fit the strain.
And when it comes to naming, you know, it's, it's an important aspect of, you know, distinguishing
yourself as a breeder or a creator of strains, um, on what you name your strains.
It's what, it's, it's the, it's going to be the world's first, um, it's going to be the
world's first experience and interface with your work.
They're going to understand, they're going to hear the name, they're going to hear about
it before they even smoke it.
You know, 99.9% of the time.
So to me, it's the, I believe it's, it's, it's the, it's the true identity that you're
going to give it for the longterm.
So I think that a lot of, um, a lot of thought, a lot of really careful thought needs to go
into what you're going to name your children, right?
So to me, the same thing you said with, with, with, with what we go naming a strain is not
really a convention.
Um, we'll go into breeding a strain and people will, you know, we'll go, Oh, let's call it
this and you'll finish the strain at the end.
And it just doesn't fucking identify with that name.
You got to call it something different.
It's, it's essence, you know, isn't exposed till you're done making the strain and it's
final and it's fun in the final product.
That's what you'd name, you know, in the consistency of, of, of your strains, your breeding it's,
it's, this is like a really, this is something I'm super passionate about is, is I think
it goes off often overlooked because a lot of breeders got to understand that every single
fucking strain is its own brand.
It's not about your company as the fucking seed brand.
That's the umbrella.
You're the carrier, you're the worker bee.
The plant is allowing you to take its pollen and make certain crosses.
I believe that more than anything, you know, but when it comes to, you know, naming these
things and giving these things a life of, and an identity, you know, uh, it's, it's,
it's a huge fucking process for us because that's gonna, that's, that's the life of the
cookies, right?
Let's say someone took cookies and Jigga said, and Jigga got lazy and was like, oh,
this is just F1 Derb cross.
You know, does it fucking taste?
Does it, when you open the bag, does it smell like a plate of fresh cookies?
Fuck no, but it has its own identity.
You could open a bag and smell cookies and that's fucking cookies and the labels right
there.
And so like our goal as breeders is to establish that, is to establish something that's easy
to remember, but also inspires a sense of the name is supposed to instantly inspire
a sense of value or, or, or an idea or a myth or, or supposed to connect with a certain
emotion.
You know, that's what we try to do when we use strains, you know, it's like, you know,
who wants real weed head knows what cat piss is.
Real weed heads know what cat piss is, but you ask your, you know, you ask people, Hey,
you want to smoke wedding cake, great pie or cat piss?
They'll probably pick the sweeter of the strains unless they know what cat piss is.
So you know, the branding is really important to me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On the money with that one.
So a sentiment someone has echoed in the past was that they were looking up some names cause
they wanted to name their strain this name.
And so they're looking to see if it's taken and sure enough it is.
And then, so they think of next in line and then sure enough, that one's taken.
Do you ever, do you ever fear that that day is going to come when there are really no
names?
It's happening fucking right now.
There's so many strains we've been working on and you know, some of these strains take
years, you know what I mean?
Some of the times, you know, we'll make an F1, the F1 will just so fucking fire.
It'll do great in testing and that will just release F1s.
But when we're, when we're trying to you know, whether we're trying to take something and
back cross it or trying to bring it to like F2, three or four, depending on what we want
to release because people want to, you know, a certain modicum of a variety.
I'm sorry I got high.
I lost my fucking train of thought.
I'm going to be real with you.
Edit that up.
Not the first time it's happened.
What was your question again?
We were talking about the names being taken.
Oh, boom.
So this is my point.
Cause that was, yeah.
So we're having that this year where we're looking up different strains.
And so we're looking at, you know, we're looking at the names that are being taken.
And so we're looking at the names that are being taken.
And so we're looking at the names that are being taken.
And so we're looking at the names that are being taken.
And so we're looking at the names that are being taken.
that we've been making, you know, things that we've made back in like 2014 and now those
names are taken, you know, so there's really a race to, you know, the seems like there's
this race for people to fucking put different strains together and just so they can claim
a certain brand name on their strain.
And you know, I don't really have a beef with that.
That's just, it's just a phenomenon of the market.
You can't bitch about it.
It's something you can't control.
So all you could do is adjust how you're gonna react
and adjust how you're gonna approach strain branding.
When we had the creme brulee,
we were pretty, for the longest time,
we were in Mendocino County.
Now we're based out of Lake Tahoe.
But Mendocino's, the same thing with Tahoe,
it's really insulated.
And this is before Instagram was really huge.
Facebook definitely was a thing.
But Instagram kinda changed the landscape
in how people really interface cannabis
and learn about different brands.
So we called, we've been working on strains
since 2012 called creme brulee.
And when we, the year we dropped it,
Bay Exclusives also had a creme brulee.
And it was kinda difficult for us,
but I felt the best way to approach that
was just to be respectful.
I wasn't trying to step on Bay Exclusives' toes.
I hit them up.
I was like, hey man, obviously great minds think alike.
I just want you to know,
I won't try to step on your toes with this.
So in other aspects, it really is,
who has the biggest reach
and what genetic is quality enough
to have their version of creme brulee
or their version of rosé,
get a certain exposure where people recognize
your version as the definitive creme brulee, say.
We got lucky with the creme brulee
because Bay Exclusives' creme brulee
was really fucking good,
but we had really good traction with the clone getting out.
And Kevin Draudry was definitely doing some selections
with Ziggy and they found some bangers.
And so that really helped it.
So when it comes to that, that's a really,
one, are we running out of strains?
And two, what happens if you have a strain
that something's already called something?
It's just really difficult.
We've been working on the sangria for a while.
We've been working on that for the past two years,
two, three years.
Last year, I believe it was, I think it was either compound.
I think it was either compound or, I could be wrong.
It's one of those really fucking fire breeders,
but someone else had a sangria.
It was just like a release.
And so that's kind of the tough decision we have this year
is like, are we gonna drop the sangria?
We already had considerable traction with it in Europe,
so we're just gonna go ahead and drop it.
It's the risk you play because you could risk,
as a breeder, you could risk pissing off other breeders,
which is never a really good idea,
and causing a stir,
because people have an extreme attachment to their work,
and definitely certain names.
That name, if it's catchy enough, it's gonna take it,
it's really gonna put legs on the strain
where the brand and the quality itself
is what's gonna establish,
what's gonna create the platform for longevity
for any particular cultivar.
It's kind of a difficult one,
because I've noticed this year,
we definitely having a hard time,
like we made a Merlot.
We made a Cherry Merlot, and we made a Merlot back in 2014,
and there's another really good,
really fucking talented breeder,
I think his name is Casey out of Yerba Buena,
in Oregon.
Or I think that's Corazon, I could be wrong,
we might have to erase that,
I might be getting people mixed up, bro.
But there's definitely,
I found out someone bred their Merlot,
and I was like, fuck!
And it was really good, it was really good,
so it was like, cool, we'll just let them have that,
you know what I mean?
We won't even try to fight for that,
we'll just find a different name.
It's hard to find new names these days,
you have to get really creative,
and more people are,
now confectionery-based strains are pretty hot,
we get all credit Jigga for being the first guy
to have a confectionery strain,
he was definitely inspired me to have,
to name my cookies Cross Crème Brûlée,
before there was a lot of,
back in 2013, before there was a lot of this on the market.
Yeah, what's interesting is,
I talked to a lot of people,
and we often discuss how,
you can draw a lot of strains,
their roots back to Chemdog,
and how quintessentially,
it's really involved in most everything,
but how would you feel about the idea of,
in say 10 years from now,
that same analogy is being made with the Cookie Crew?
Because I can almost see it happening.
100%, you can see it happening,
you can see the lines that,
see Junkie J Beazy's working,
who's killing it right now,
I don't know these guys personally,
I don't have a vested interest in their companies,
I love cannabis, I'm a fan,
when I'm doing my work,
I try to not focus on what other people,
but as a fan, I like to follow other people,
and see what they're doing,
because I'm fucking generally a big fan of cannabis,
so you can see, J Beazy's killing it,
and a lot of his stock is based on,
on different OG Kush phenotypes,
and definitely the cookies,
his Kush mints, his wedding cake,
a lot of these are cookie derivatives,
so Jigga did something pretty amazing,
the cookies likes to breed true,
it likes to mix with things,
and I think we're gonna see that in 10 years,
I think we're gonna start seeing,
maybe in 10 years,
a lot of these crosses are gonna come from cats,
like compound or symbiotic,
you know what I mean,
I guess it's whatever's fire at the time,
but something as definitive as cookies,
hell yeah, there's so many strains crossed with,
but what Jigga did with the cookies,
forced people to really look further,
into what lions are doing,
you know what I mean,
I think he had,
the cookie fam had a really good idea,
had a really good feel for what was hot for the market,
at that time,
they had a really good eye for selecting in my opinion,
because when I'm working cookies crosses,
and I'm inbreeding them,
and I'm out crossing them,
I'm using different parents,
that I'm assuming that they used,
I get to see kind of what goes into cookies,
and what's making all these strains so fucking fun,
what's in cookies that's making these strains
so fucking fire,
you know,
so.
I guess that brings us to the million dollar question,
what do you think's in cookies?
I'm not even gonna touch that,
what I do know,
what I do know is that there's definitely,
you know,
I've seen a lot of Hindu,
a lot of Hindu tendencies,
like if you ever take Mendocino,
like Laytonville in particular,
Spirock area,
you know,
Cuddle Peak area,
is a really good example of how,
you know,
they've been holding,
you know,
old Hindu Kush varieties,
since, you know,
the early to late 70s,
and so in these,
you know,
old Hindu Kush varieties,
which Tom Hill later bred into,
as the deep chunk,
we still have access to these seeds,
and so a lot of,
we were seeing a lot of similarities,
a lot of parallels between,
how the cookies grows and behaves,
the frost profile,
the noses,
and with the Hindus,
so, you know,
that could be wrong,
you know what I mean?
You could be wrong,
but it's just a general,
it was just, you know,
based on years of observation,
and having an established pattern,
you know,
we're not fucking scientists,
but we definitely know that observation,
is the cornerstone of evolution,
so as breeders,
and intuitive breeders,
cause we're all not scientists,
we're not fucking doctors,
we basically use this observation,
so we can see,
what's in a strain,
so when it came to cookies,
it really made me look,
so the cookie fam has cookies and sherbet,
and then there's the big debate about,
if Skittles came from sherbet,
and so,
I grew cookies,
next to Skittles,
next to cherry pie,
next to sherbet,
I grew it next to Royal Kush,
I grew it,
and I grew it all next to an old school Urkel,
and to me,
that Urkel was the most common denominator,
I found between a lot of those strains,
I think a lot of these really exciting flavors,
that Mandelbrot got,
out of his Royal Kush lines,
that was the fucking,
I thought it was the sour for years,
until I took all these cultivars,
and I grew them next to the Urkel,
and you could see,
a striking similarity between all these cultivars,
not so much in the cookies,
but more in the,
definitely in the Skittles,
and in the sherbs,
I saw a lot of telltale signs,
of Urkel,
a lot of these really exciting flavors,
you know,
Urkel and OG,
are really the fathers of a lot of these,
really exciting fruit flavors,
that have like these really strong,
grapey,
you know,
almost vineyard kind of floral,
you know,
bouquets,
so,
I wish I had my fucking reading notes with me,
because it's really interesting where you're getting at,
and so I try to look at,
what's making everything so hot,
in the fucking market right now,
what's the most common denominator,
you know,
certain,
you know,
populations of strains,
when I say populations,
I'm telling like populations of OG,
populations of,
of things that are crossed either with,
GDP,
or Urkel,
because you wouldn't have GDP without the fucking Urkel,
so the Urkel is like,
one of the original,
you know,
purple,
that was the original purple strain,
that had this fucking incredible crazy flavor,
and so I've noticed that going back to the Urkel,
you know,
the Urkels where you wouldn't have cherry pie,
without the Urkel,
you know,
there was so many similarities between cherry pie Urkel,
that was,
that was unreal to me,
same thing with the Skittles,
the Skittles actually,
you know,
I don't think it's directly a descendant of Urkel,
but you could definitely see,
I'm still trying to fucking figure out what's in Skittles,
but you grow it next to an Urkel,
you can't,
you can't help but,
but to see the similarities,
and so that's all we're trying to do,
we're just trying to guess and see where straight,
where flavors are coming from,
but,
you know,
some is definitive as cookies,
that's,
you know,
I think that's going to be something that,
you know,
like every,
all these strains came from sour or chem dog or OG,
five to 10 years,
there's still going to be strains coming from gelato,
cookies,
and sherbet,
you know what I mean?
It's,
they're good.
Yeah, totally.
And so I guess one of the questions I wanted to ask quickly,
do you trust the Phylos results on Skittles?
You know,
honestly,
I'm going to be real,
since we're on the podcast,
the Phylos results were,
was what made,
the Phylos results was provided,
at the time it provided the evidence where I was like,
obviously,
you know,
the owners of this,
whoever created this strain,
it's really muddied,
and it's really foggy,
but what Phylos is,
was,
you can't argue with genetics,
right?
That's a fucking science,
right?
But also at the same time,
you know,
the whole genome hasn't been sequenced too,
and we know that,
and also the thing with Phylos too,
it's at the discretion of who,
who,
who,
you know,
there's a lot of human error involved,
where I work with a lot of breeders,
I work with a lot of fucking nurseries,
and anybody,
a lot of people are going to identify with this,
where they get a fucking tray of clones,
and some clones are mislabeled,
or you get plants from people,
and some plants are mislabeled,
so that's,
that could be a possibility where something was mislabeled,
and that happened,
you know what I mean?
And this is just based on that one Skittles test,
I haven't gone back to the galaxy,
and explored more,
because as a geneticist,
it's hard for me to reconcile,
being,
it's hard for me to reconcile the reality of,
a lot of people submitting their genetic data to Phylos,
and all this data is siloed,
and we're seeing this in genomics companies,
like 23andMe,
we're seeing this with the new genomics blockchain company,
called Nebula,
where you know,
you have,
you know,
these genomics companies,
where data donors,
and in this case,
breeders and growers,
donate their DNA,
and they'll sequence it for a fee,
and then at the same time,
that data for a regular human genomics company,
that data's gonna be bought,
by a data buyer,
that's why these business models are so fucking successful,
is because data,
you know,
data buyers,
that's a huge business,
data acquisition,
for research,
and especially when it comes to human genomics,
is for you know,
personalized medicine,
and so when we see,
where the industry is going with cannabis,
are we gonna make personalized strains,
for people's individual cannabinoid systems,
how, you know,
what's the evolution of genetics gonna be,
so when it comes to someone like Phylos,
you know,
I think it's really cool,
I have a lot of respect for,
for what they did,
but just to me as a breeder,
I think there needs to be a platform,
where all the data is definitely decentralized,
and it's still owned outright,
by the data donors,
and the data donors have a right to say,
you know,
what they can't do with that data,
so you know,
that's you know,
definitely how I feel about that,
yeah,
so I think I went down a little rabbit hole right there,
but no,
no,
that's perfect,
I think what they're,
what they're,
they were the first cannabis genomics company,
you know,
so I've you know,
I have a lot of you know,
respect for that,
but there is,
there is a huge possibility,
for all this data to be abused,
there is when you have siloed data,
you,
the data is in one particular place,
I don't give a fuck how much security you have,
that's hackable,
I mean this is why blockchain's huge right now,
it's because you have things on thousands of servers,
and so you can't hack thousands of servers,
but you could fucking hack one,
you know,
and prior to me,
you know,
you know,
doing cannabis full time,
you know,
I was kicked out of the army for smoking weed,
but while I was in the army,
I was,
I was intelligence,
and so these are things that when it comes to data,
you know,
information's everything,
so that's how all breeders,
protect your fucking data,
this is,
nobody knows how big the genetics market's gonna be,
nobody knows how valuable that data's gonna be,
there's gonna be huge pharmaceutical cannabis companies,
that are,
that are can't wait to buy all this data,
so they could,
you know,
genetically modify strains,
or they could,
or they could,
you know,
do breeding,
marker assisted breeding,
to find certain strains,
and to go and patent those flavor profiles,
and that's just one scenario,
you know,
so it's,
to me,
when it comes to the breeders work,
and their data,
you gotta protect that,
but you know,
we definitely got down a rabbit hole,
because you know,
you're the root of your question,
was you know,
phylo sequencing,
you know,
the skittles and phylo's work,
you know,
I think that work was great,
but at the same time,
there just needs to be a platform,
where all the breeders could still control their data,
and who interfaces it.
Yeah,
I love it man,
let's keep going down this rabbit hole,
so the next question is,
you know,
you just touched on like big companies,
and like the legal side,
and the need for security,
I totally agree,
we see people trademarking things within the industry,
but we don't see cease and desist being commonplace,
how long do you think it is,
until that does start to occur,
and we see what you kind of predicted?
Ooh,
I guess it's gonna really depend on,
you know,
my lawyer always tells me,
who's,
who else,
who has the most money for litigation,
you know,
so whoever has,
you know,
whatever company hones,
whatever said trademark,
you know,
if they have a big enough war chest,
it won't be a problem,
you know,
sending cease and desist letters,
and backing that up,
you know,
legally backing that up,
and financially backing that up,
you know,
so I definitely see this as,
it's difficult,
because it's,
a lot of people are worried about exactly what you're,
what you're talking about right now,
you know,
what if someone goes out and trademarks our,
you know,
our strain names,
or our brand,
and sends us the cease and desist,
so, you know,
I think that when you're,
you know,
most of these cease and desist,
unless someone's stealing your brand,
you know,
try a little harder to come up with something more unique,
you know what I mean?
So,
you know,
like we named the Testarossa,
you know,
when Ferrari sends me a cease and desist,
it'll be,
it'll be both a horrible,
and a great day,
for me,
because we've reached that,
that level of exposure,
where Ferrari,
you know,
so I think it's a good thing,
you know,
like look at Gorilla Glue,
you know,
like I beat up by,
you know,
they could have called it GG4,
but at the same time,
man,
Josie Wales and the Gorilla Glue crew,
you're fucking,
your name in pot history,
is etched in stone now,
you know,
so you could,
I think,
you know,
there's always,
you could,
in those instances,
you could kind of turn shit into sugar,
you know,
and I think if,
you know,
these trademark things are really difficult,
you know,
trademarking different strain names,
how do you,
you know,
how do you,
you know,
reinforce that?
Is it first to file,
or the first to invent?
You know,
what if someone invents something,
and someone goes out and trademarks it?
You know,
this is a really,
this is a,
trying to navigate cannabis right now,
in regulation,
to me is like playing three dimensional chess,
in a fucking dark room.
You're constantly figuring,
and you're feeling your way things out,
you learn by making mistakes,
you know what I mean?
And you're really just feeling,
and there's so many dimensions and facets to it,
that you're constantly having to adjust fire,
and adapt to a new set of circumstances.
So right now,
you used to be able to call your strains whatever,
and now if you're not careful,
certain big companies will send you a cease and desist.
Like Matt Rise,
was one of the first people,
to get a cease and desist.
He had the,
Shatter Brothers,
and the Shatter Brothers,
and this was coming out of Hopland,
back in like,
you know,
2011,
2012,
Matt Rise was one of the first guys to popularize,
you know,
ice wax extraction,
he was one of the,
he was one of those guys,
and he also had a Shatter Company,
and the Shatter Company had,
this depiction of fucking Mario and Luigi,
making shatter.
And Nintendo sent those guys a cease and desist,
you know,
so,
you know it was definitely,
you know it could be a bad thing,
but,
damn Matt,
you know,
your exposure was to the point,
where you got Nintendo's attention.
So,
I don't know,
this could be turned into a game by some breeders,
but I think it's a slippery slope,
I think it's a dangerous one.
Yeah definitely.
Well,
we hear talks about big players,
getting involved in the industry,
even like,
you know kind of well known big players,
I cringe to say it,
but that Dan Bilzerian guy,
has been in the news for a minute.
What do you think about this type of move?
Do you think it's just like,
a fad thing,
and do you think overall it's a good or a bad thing,
to have rich people getting involved in the industry?
Cause I've kind of heard arguments on both sides I guess.
I mean,
here's how I feel about it,
you know,
you know when people like Dan Bilzerian,
you could tell by that guy's fucking IG feed,
he's definitely a weed guy,
you know what I mean?
If you're into guns,
partying,
that kind of lifestyle,
you're definitely smoking some fucking weed right?
So it's like,
I know a lot of these guys,
that come from that same,
that similar worlds as Dan's world,
and they're fucking weed people,
you know what I mean?
But that doesn't necessarily mean that,
you understand the industry.
You know this is kind of like,
I'm not using Dan as an example,
he's a different example,
I don't know the fucking guy,
I just know him through his reputation,
and he's getting busy investing,
but a lot of these corporate guys,
that are coming into the industry,
and they think that,
it's gonna work out for them,
just cause they're fucking rich.
It reminds me a lot of when Paris Hilton,
tried becoming a EDM DJ,
she got laughed off stage,
laughed out of the fucking industry,
they're like,
oh that's cute,
your money's gonna be a panacea for lack of talent,
get the fuck out of here.
And so that's,
you know,
how we feel about this is,
you know you have all these corporate cannabis guys,
coming into the game,
and they don't know the game.
People forget,
this shit's like fucking music.
You feel me?
You know rappers,
rappers are like the growers in our industry.
You know breeders are like the producers.
You know what I mean?
And so you have to,
and at the same thing with it being like music,
all the trends in cannabis start at the street level.
That was the magic of cookies.
That was the magic of,
you know,
take anybody that was big from the Emerald Cup,
you know,
Dying Breed,
Mean Gene,
those fucking guys,
they all got hell and street credit.
You know what I mean?
You don't get to that level without having that connection,
you know,
with that street aspect.
You know people forget,
it's like,
oh yeah we're growing medicine,
but can we all fucking acknowledge for a minute,
that California was the largest producer of cannabis,
the entire country,
growing the country's fucking weed,
and it all wasn't medicine guys.
You know?
All that pushing,
the trends of what's pushed on the street,
and what's in demand,
happens on the fucking street level.
And it has to be co-signed on the street.
You can't be a famous rapper,
without being co-signed by someone from the hood,
or being co-signed by some OG in the industry,
like P Diddy,
or J Prince,
you know,
from Rap-A-Lot Records,
who helped create,
shape and shift fucking hip hop as it is,
you know,
right now.
So it's like with corporate guys coming in,
I think it's,
you know,
there's something to learn from them,
when they have these really,
really efficient business processes,
and really efficient ways for understanding markets,
in ways weed guys can't,
you know,
understand the market.
But just because you have those talents,
doesn't mean that you could connect,
with fucking smokers.
That's why we say it's like music,
you know,
an artist's entire fucking job,
is to connect with people around the world,
is to put something,
take something from nothing,
put his heart into the studio,
and connect with the world.
The growers do the same exact thing.
Breeder lays the track,
he puts the strain into the grower's hand,
and the grower's gonna express that strain,
in a different way than any other grower.
Right?
And so when that weed leaves,
when that quality leaves,
that usually goes to the street level,
or the quality's gonna be acknowledged at the street level.
We don't see any corporate cannabis guys,
coming in,
and just killing the game right now.
You know,
selling out the top shelf,
and the street,
and everybody collectively agreeing,
saying that,
that corporate cannabis company is putting out top shelf.
And it just doesn't exist right now.
You know,
so it's like,
you could put all the money you can,
but still,
Big Al,
Exotics,
out of fucking Santa Rosa,
they're the first company right now,
with a hundred dollar eighth.
You know what I'm saying?
It's like,
so all these guys,
are trying to start these fucking brands,
and they all wanna be luxury cannabis,
and put this booth,
in these really nice packages.
But if you don't have fucking street credit,
and you don't have,
you don't have the fucking real DNA,
the passion,
you're not willing to fucking sacrifice everything,
for your craft,
you ain't gonna make it.
Because there's guys out there,
who are sacrificing everything,
for their fucking craft,
and that's the fire.
That's the fire.
That's,
when it's that good,
that's what makes people remember.
That's the music.
And that's what connects with people.
You know what I mean?
And so that's what I was like,
as an artist,
that's what the cookie fam,
you know,
a lot of people talk shit.
I respect the hustle.
You know what I'm saying?
It's like,
I came from fucking nothing.
I didn't grow up in Mendo.
I'm a transplant.
I came in Mendo,
with a broken beamer,
with Texas plates,
and a broken windshield.
I was pulled over all the fucking time.
And so to see people,
and so to interface that street level,
and then see people like the cookie fam,
use that to their advantage,
and create,
you know,
make history,
you know,
connect with people in that way,
really follow that music,
while I connect people that way.
That's how you're gonna,
you know,
reach success.
A lot of these corporate processes,
these guys are,
these guys don't know what the fuck they're doing,
to be quite honest with you.
Some of them do,
but really it's like,
you're making money right now,
but you know,
a lot of people in the game right now,
the real true believers,
like Big Al and Frenchie,
we're in this for the rest of our fucking lives.
And so that's who the corporate cannabis guy's
gotta deal with.
You know what I mean?
Just because you have a million dollars,
and you like making shoes,
doesn't mean that you're gonna be Christian Louboutin,
tomorrow.
Or you're gonna be,
you know what I mean?
You're not gonna be Manolo Blahnik,
tomorrow,
just because you have fucking money.
This is art.
And that's what these corporate guys don't get.
It's not a fucking commodity.
If you wanna play commodities,
grow your big ass outdoors in your greenhouses,
and turn that shit into oil.
That's not our fucking market.
That's not the breeders and the growers market.
You can't shape,
you can't create,
shape and shift the history of cannabis,
through putting booth on the fucking market.
You create,
shape and shift the history of cannabis,
by changing the flavor profiles,
and getting everybody to agree,
that's fucking hot.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, it's like,
they don't seem to understand that like,
trends and things are started by creative people,
and then people like them more so take over it.
But you touched on this perfect idea, right?
With Big Al,
I had a question perfectly lined up for that.
And so,
we've kind of seen in response to that $100 eighths of Mac,
that Caps,
you know, Capulator hasn't been too happy.
And his argument was that,
he doesn't want his brand associated with this type of,
what he would call price gouging.
What are your thoughts on that?
Do you think a breeder gets to have a say,
that extends that far out, so to speak?
You know, let me start from this level,
Cap's probably one of the most talented guys,
in the industry right now.
He's creating shit,
nobody's fucking creating.
You know,
only guys coming close to Cap right now,
is fucking in-house and seed junkie,
J-Beezy.
So with like,
being a breeder,
I understand why he's upset.
I understand why he wouldn't want that,
because he's the creator,
that's his baby.
You know what I'm saying?
But on the flip side,
I used to have those reactions too.
And then I realized that,
when you let something out on the market,
it's gonna take its own life.
It could either be,
a success,
or it could be a failure.
But as a breeder,
you have to accept,
either one of those dichotomies.
It's up,
you have to.
Because,
control is a fucking illusion.
And that's what breeding taught me,
is that control is illusion,
you can't control shit.
Especially when you send stuff down range.
You send things down the pipeline,
seeds, clones,
they're gonna take a life of their own.
You know what,
so,
with Cap being upset,
I just had a hard time understanding why he would,
why he wasn't so receptive,
to that kind of exposure.
But at the same time,
he's really one of those true believers.
Like one of those,
really down to earth dudes,
that's not into flashing shit.
And he's really about the craft.
So,
I genuinely see,
where he's coming from.
And I respect his point.
But I also have another side of me,
where,
I've always dreamed,
of there being a luxury cannabis component,
for people to participate in.
You know,
that was why we started Aficionado that way,
back in 2012.
Is,
I was like,
fuck,
if Mendocino and Humble,
can,
can establish appellations,
a form of prestige,
right,
like that you see in wine,
then that would stabilize the long term price of cannabis.
And so,
on that same note,
like,
if you use Bordeaux as a model,
where they created the Bordeaux appellation,
in the mid 1800s,
and they got a premium on their wine,
it was then,
up to the participating brands in Bordeaux,
to make Bordeaux,
Bordeaux,
to make it what it is today.
So that was,
the goal was to make Aficionado,
this,
this apparatus that allowed us to,
to participate in high end cannabis when the day came.
You know what I'm saying?
And so it's like,
Big Al was the first to do it,
he was the first to sell $100 at eighth.
And,
everything isn't binary.
That's my,
that's my thing,
it's like I'm not mad at anyone,
but they say fucking binary,
just because it's $100 at eighth doesn't mean,
all samples of Max are gonna be,
go for $100.
You know,
but,
but we can't ignore that price demographic.
You know,
people who are students of economics,
the luxury industry is the only industry that can fucking
continues to grow despite recessions.
And so it's like,
you know,
if you're a small guy,
you don't have a huge fucking corporate war chest,
but what you do is you have fucking talent,
and you have quality,
man,
where are these Christian Louboutins gonna come from in our
industry?
Where's the John Paul Gaultier's,
where's the real Louis Vuittons?
You know,
this is,
this is what's fucking possible right now.
So that's why I'm telling people like,
stop,
you know,
don't,
don't necessarily,
you know,
resist this new fucking phenomenon.
This is a great thing for small people,
because small people are the only people who have the
prestige,
the heritage and the roots to be considered a luxury brand.
Cause if money and nice branding considered you a luxury
brand,
then can destined to be a fucking luxury brand,
but they're not.
There is,
is not.
So it's like,
you know,
when you have,
you know,
what are the prerequisites for luxury brands?
All right,
well,
it's a unique know how in a particular area of expertise.
Your work has to have an incredible attention to detail,
you have to use different ingredients and,
and,
and techniques and then other people use,
it's kind of almost like food too.
You know what separates a thousand dollars,
you know,
$300 steak from a $30 steak,
you know,
ingredients,
technique and timing.
And so,
and also the prestige of the chef preparing it.
And so you need all these things to,
to,
to justify yourself as,
as being raw enough to command those fucking prices.
You know,
who knows the longevity of the a hundred dollar eighth,
but it's a fucking phenomenon right now.
And it's amazing that someone from our community was able to
establish that was able to break that boundary.
Someone from our neighborhood broke that boundary and not
corporate cannabis.
Like,
why can't we just realize that?
Cause I bet you,
if it was some corporate cannabis guys,
everybody would be up in arms.
This would be fucked up.
All corporate cannabis.
We knew this would happen,
blah,
blah.
And then the pendulum swings the other way.
The small guy with 40 fucking lights selling a hundred
dollar eighths to Migos.
They opened that strain up to a wider,
more diverse audience,
just because of price point alone,
the laws of economics did take that too.
There's an entire demographic,
a clientele and customer that only discerns value based on
the perceived price.
Be they don't know any better than,
than how did they know?
Well,
well price is one indicator where it's like,
okay,
it's obviously has some extra level of prestige,
but it better fucking,
it,
it,
it better be good.
Which is the whole thing.
And,
and there's arguments,
whether,
you know,
was it worth a hundred dollars an eighth?
Well,
fucking millionaires like Migos,
definitely fucking felt that it was worth a hundred dollars
an eighth.
And so that's the trend that needs to happen is that when
you have these different brands,
we're able to interface and open new opportunities for small
guys that are,
that got the fire.
The big guys don't got the fire.
It's the small guys.
So this is a great,
this is a great time for small people,
man.
It was like,
I was happy as fuck,
man.
I called Frenchy.
I was getting roasted,
but it's good.
Cause he,
he's killing it.
Every,
every,
if you're angry,
you anger can't exist without fear.
You know what I'm saying?
So it's like a fear based emotion.
If you angry,
it's like,
what are you scared of?
Is what I want to ask a lot of these people.
Not necessarily cap.
I'm not talking to cap in this particular context.
Cause I,
I hun,
hunterly wholeheartedly see where crap's coming from.
Cause he's a creator,
but with other people,
like other people that are really chiming on,
on the subject,
it's like,
you know,
you can't just be happy for,
for,
for big Al.
I mean that,
yeah,
that that's calculators beef,
but something was done in the industry.
That's going to help the small guy more than anything else.
You know,
this is a huge,
it's going to be a huge economic force for,
for,
for guys that are at the top of their game that got the shit
together and know how to communicate and sell their strains.
You know what I mean?
And right now a big Al was able to do that.
Cap's going to be able to do that too.
He doesn't want to count.
He wasn't going to gouge people,
you know?
So it's like a lot of these growers are going to come out.
You're going to see crazy.
There's going to be a price war,
but there needs to also be a spectrum of brands.
It just can't be affordable cannabis.
It just can't be affordable wine and affordable alcohol.
You know,
people gave me shit about my prices for years.
I'm just like,
deal with it.
I'm sorry.
Like I only make certain,
you know,
so many strains per year.
Yeah.
I fuck a sift through a lot of strains.
And so this is like,
it only reached like a couple hundred boxes of each trade
anyway.
So yeah.
You know,
so,
but it's,
it's really in the eye of the holder.
Yeah.
I,
I've spoken to a lot of people who have these opinions.
And what I find to be the most interesting part of it all is
that these same people aspire to have,
you know,
luxury cars.
It's like,
they're okay with luxury something else,
but not in our industry.
Exactly.
Exactly.
And it's like,
you know,
essentially where,
you know,
there are your people who like to ball out in our industry,
but you know,
the cool thing about the industry,
which is,
you know,
one of the positives that we do have a lot of humble people,
a lot of humble people that,
that don't need the flash that don't need to,
you know,
when Swerve was blowing up back in the day,
posting pictures of his Jaguar,
motherfucker was getting hated on.
That's not necessarily our culture.
You know what I'm saying?
It's like,
if you're flossing and you're in the weed game and you were
putting that on Instagram,
you were wrong.
Cause you're basically dry snitching on yourself.
You know what I'm saying?
It's like,
it's so,
you know,
but I like the fact that the community has this sense of
humbleness to them because humbleness is in,
in,
in lack of ego is what's needed to,
to create true craft.
But I think once you create that craft,
there needs to be a mechanism to be able to open that craft
to what's the highest potential this,
you know,
our market has this boutique craftsman.
You,
we can't do,
we can't get a fucking price for a corporate cannabis.
That's for damn sure.
But you know what?
There's definitely this huge underserved demographic
of,
you know,
upscale oriented customers that want to indulge in this
level of weed.
And it fucking exists,
you know,
cats like big Al cats like fucking,
you know,
Capulator and fucking compound.
These guys are growing the fire,
like crazy fire,
you know?
And so,
but I think that we,
they also,
everybody collectively deserves more.
I think that you spent time in the game and,
and you really cut your teeth and you sacrificed everything.
I think that it's a great fucking moment when,
when the market could acknowledge that,
you know,
your,
your stuff is worth,
you know,
you know,
X amount,
you know?
So I think you could love her to hate it.
You know,
you could sit in front of a Rolex shop,
you know,
with a time X on your risk and fucking bitch about life all
day saying,
Oh,
my watch tells I better.
And you guys are ripping people off,
but that's just like,
that's just like,
you guys got to shift your focus,
your awareness from that particular perspective and,
and broaden your horizons.
Like,
Oh,
what are the opportunities in this?
Cause if big Al could do it,
how many other people could do it?
And so like,
we don't know what the longevity of these price points are
like first off,
but,
but we do know that the luxury,
you know,
luxury clientele demographic continues to grow worldwide.
You know,
that that's a fact.
So,
you know,
we definitely know that in cannabis is quickly becoming
international.
Canada has already taken international us is we're really
behind right now on that,
you know,
cause we can have a serious edge,
but when it does go international,
man,
when it does go international,
we have to be cognizant of this entire spectrum of customer.
Who do you want to sell to?
You know,
and that's cool.
If you want to be Jack Daniels,
that's cool.
If you want to be ever clear,
you want to be Budweiser.
We need these people.
We need those price points in the ecosystem to
differentiate ourselves,
you know,
fucking Chateau Montrachet at $30,000 a bottle needs box
wine to create that fucking huge chasm of separation that
reminds people,
this is why you're paying X amount for this bottle of wine.
And it's like,
I want to see that in cannabis.
It's always been my dream to do that.
You know,
we've tried doing that.
You know,
we've been doing that with,
you know,
we got really lucky.
We've been doing that with seeds,
you know,
for the last seven years,
but you know,
when it came to flowers,
anybody could smoke a flower.
Only a few people can grow seeds.
You know,
you have to really know,
you know,
kind of what a fishing out is working with or know us from
back in the day to kind of really understand our value.
You know,
we don't think that,
you know,
we're big players in the genetics game.
We just really,
really passionate about what we do,
but only so many people could grow seeds,
but anybody,
anybody could smoke a flower.
Anybody could smoke hash.
That's what's Frenchie's power is.
Fuck it smokes out thousands of people every month.
So everybody knows what Frenchie is,
right?
And so the same thing is with,
with,
with fire ass growers,
anybody could experience that.
And so it's like,
if anybody could experience that,
what place in the market do you choose or wish to
participate in?
You know,
why live it yourself?
If you're worth that,
you know,
really like is,
is being aware better than being humble,
you know,
or is being humble better than being aware,
you know,
which,
which of these paths are we going to choose as,
as breeders,
growers and marketers?
We can't,
we have all sorts of seeds,
like just because you're creative craft,
it's up to you to fucking now communicate this and market
it to the world.
It's value.
You know?
So it's like,
it's,
it's,
it's choices and big Al made a choice and it was a great
choice.
And I just think it was really,
it was,
I thought it was just really unfortunate that,
you know,
the tension between,
you know,
big Al and,
and cap is there,
you know,
cause you know,
the two guys are,
are genuinely good people.
You know,
I never met cap,
but my partner Leo,
you know,
knows him and he says,
you know,
great.
Everybody I know that knows caps is great.
Think about him.
So he's a nice guy.
Same thing with big Al.
He's like the most humble,
chill fucking dude.
He just loves weed.
And so it's like,
I think,
you know,
it's unfortunate,
but there's also a really cool potential for,
for people to come back,
you know,
to come back full circle and,
you know,
maybe collaborate,
you know,
someday down the future,
you know,
because that's powerful.
What happened?
You know,
whether you like,
liked it.
I would have sent a limo full of fucking women to big Al's
house.
If he did that with my strength,
that's just me.
Just to start the thank you process.
You know what I mean?
Cause we need that edge.
Small time guys,
boutique cultivators need a distinct edge over corporate
candidates.
And this is what's happening right now.
You know,
like these guys are breaking down fucking doors.
So other boutique cultivators can participate in these
markets,
interface these higher levels of society,
because a lot of people fucking forget,
man,
even though a lot of trends happen at the street level,
trends also pair happened parallel at these really high end
levels too.
You know,
there's also very rich trend centers too.
So we can't ignore,
you know,
if you're really in the weed and you,
and your job is to get your strain and you really want your
strain to connect with people,
not through hyper bullshit,
but literally to be shared and connect with people because
your work is good.
That's something magical,
man.
Yeah,
totally.
So I think we might jump out of this rabbit hole for a
moment and go down a different one.
I just wanted to,
just wanted to loop back onto a point you made almost at the
start of the interview,
you mentioned the creme brulee,
you had a bit of luck in that the clone got out there and it
brought up this really interesting point of what is it like
to have a clone of yours?
It's like a really nice one that's been found selected and
it gets out there.
Is there a good or a bad thing?
Cause on the one hand,
it's like,
you know,
obviously there's good sides to it,
but at the other hand,
it's like,
well,
if people can get access to the clone,
they're probably not going to buy the seed.
So how do you feel about it?
Is it as good or as a bad?
No,
that's whoever's logic that was,
this is wrong.
Like,
right.
I mean,
like look at all the cookie cross seeds,
you know,
if cookie clone was on the market,
you know,
you wouldn't have,
you wouldn't have that,
the success of those crosses.
I think it's,
I think it's,
it's hugely,
I used to hoard.
So this is me talking from experience and,
and,
and somewhat regret that some of my best work,
I didn't put into the market,
you know,
you know,
this is kind of one of the things I learned,
working with Kevin Jodri back in the day,
you know,
who had one of the biggest nurseries at the time,
at Home Bowl.
And,
you know,
in order for your shit to be on the market,
you literally,
like in order to be hot in the market,
you have to have thousands of growers growing this shit.
And you have to have thousands of pounds,
tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands of pounds,
a year straight,
touching people's hands across the country,
across the world.
You know,
so that doesn't happen unless you let the clone out.
You know,
so whatever you lose ownership,
you know,
there's this,
there's this false assumption.
People are gonna argue with me this,
there's this false assumption that,
Oh,
if I'm like the only one with this cut,
I'm gonna hoard it.
And I'm gonna,
it's,
it,
you,
you limit its growth if you don't let it out,
because yeah,
you could show the world that you're the best at growing,
you know,
any particular,
you know,
this particular strain,
but growers and breeders,
we're all competitive people,
like by nature.
Like that's why we,
you know,
we compete with ourselves to get better than ourselves,
and that's how people get better.
But we love showing our shit to each other.
We love that.
And so people love to say,
Oh,
that was your cookies.
Look at my cookies.
You know,
and that's part of,
that's part of the culture too.
What helps a strain get out there is when it's a joy to grow.
And it's also,
it's also,
it doubles as,
it doubles as,
you know,
an opportunity for you to be able to,
to express,
you know,
what your best possible effort is,
you know?
So I think if you have a fire strain,
you gotta let,
you gotta let it out.
The market's gotta test it,
you know,
cause really the market,
you could say it's fire all day long,
but if people ain't cloning it,
and pounds,
you know,
pounds aren't flowing in the clubs,
cause people could clone it.
You could have a million clones out there,
but if the clubs or the,
or the streets ain't buying that weed,
again,
they'll buy it.
You know what I mean?
I remember when Barry White came out,
it was the frostiest strain that hit Mendocino
in a long time.
And at one year,
everybody grew it,
and everybody bought it,
but one time,
you know?
So it's like,
you get repeat buyers,
people say,
oh,
cookies is hype.
It's not fucking hype,
man.
Millions of people are still buying it,
and they come back,
and they buy it again.
That's not hype.
That's real.
Yeah,
I totally agree.
So,
to have that,
you gotta put your strain out there.
You gotta put the clone out there,
which,
you know,
I fell short on,
you know,
the past,
you know,
five years,
you know,
but I learned from,
you know,
I had to learn from my mistakes to go,
okay,
really the right way is to let it out.
You know,
you lose ownership of it,
cool,
but if you really wanna test your work against the market,
and see how hot you are as a breeder,
you gotta put that shit out there.
Yeah,
good plan.
So,
take us back.
When did Aficionados start in your mind?
Like,
2011.
And what was the first project?
You know,
it kinda grew out of,
you know,
I always had my,
I was,
you know,
I started growing when I was in Germany,
and I went to Amsterdam a lot,
smoked a lot of weed,
smoked a lot of hash,
always brought seeds back.
I just thought it was cool that,
you know,
I could collect these seeds.
Then I started hanging out with some German college students
that were growing organic indoor,
and
they were breeding.
Like,
they were crossing their super silver haze to like,
you know,
straight up land races like,
Afghanis,
and old school,
like not even land races,
but old school like black dominos,
like shit you don't see,
you know,
anymore,
and you know,
that was really my crash course into,
you know,
the next level of growing,
you know,
and this dude was just having fun.
He wasn't like a serious breeder.
He was like,
I hate buying seeds,
so I just make my own seeds,
so I don't have to buy seeds,
and it turns out good.
And I thought that was cool,
you know,
so after I,
you know,
got out of the army in Germany,
I,
you know,
brought my seed collection back to the States,
and,
you know,
met with,
you know,
the guy who became my mentor,
you know,
Mendocino Mike,
and he took me up,
he took me up,
but you know,
that aficionado kind of,
you know,
was created out of,
you know,
when I was growing,
when you're growing the best possible cannabis,
it just comes logical that you have to breed
your own strains,
right?
So whether you have a strain and clone form,
you know,
it's going to come to a time where you have to start
breeding your own strains to have a unique edge
over the market.
Like if you get to the point where you can read the market,
and,
and see what people want,
you know,
that's when I really started taking breeding seriously
was when I was in Mendo with Mike,
and,
I,
then I started on my,
then I got my own scene,
and I did what every other grower does to make ends meet.
You gotta,
you gotta do business,
right?
You got,
you gotta help your friends out.
You gotta make sure that,
that,
that the right things flow through the right pipelines.
So the cool thing about that is you,
I was able to like read the market in a way where I was like,
okay,
I think people want this.
And so I'd make a cross,
now test it out,
and I grow it out,
and the buyers would like it.
And then it came to the time where buyers were coming and
they wanted just all sours.
They wanted all chem dogs.
They want all sours,
but they were buying chem dog too.
And this was like the headliners before,
you know,
OG,
you know,
really hit the market and,
and crazy bulk up at Homeboat Mendo's like chems and sours
were like the biggest thing.
And so these repeat guys that were coming back and making
sure that things were flowing,
they wanted,
they was like,
look man,
if you could hook our farmers up with,
with,
with a strain that smells like this consistently,
then we'll,
we'll buy the whole crop.
And so that was really,
I was like,
Holy fuck.
I could probably,
I could like,
because I've seen so much product flow,
you know,
in Mendocino and Humboldt,
I had a good idea for like,
you know,
who the best growers were,
what the hottest genetics were.
I knew that even if the,
the,
the buyers weren't coming into town,
that even if,
even if this wasn't what they were looking for,
all I had to do is open the fucking bag.
So like I've all,
I found out early that all you gotta do is exceed
expectations.
So we created a chem dog strain
and gave it to our friends.
We grew it.
The buyers bought it all.
And that was,
we exceeded the expectations of that chem dog.
And we ended up entering that,
that next year.
And so,
you know,
when it came to a fish,
you know,
it was kind of like,
Oh,
let's start a seed company.
You know,
I was really inspired to start the seed company from Shiloh
massive before he started dying breed.
You know,
he had this project called massive seeds that he was doing
like way back in the day.
And you know,
that was like,
you know,
that was really my first interface into like,
you know,
the seed breeders world.
Cause all the breeders I knew,
like the seed breeders world,
that was like the cannabis industry,
all the breeders I was getting my seeds from in Mendo,
you know,
if it wasn't from Europe,
we're just like these old,
these old growers,
you know?
And so I was paying through the ass for OG seeds.
Like that's why we came up with our particular price point.
Cause I was buying $50 a seed OG seeds back in 2010,
you know,
2000,
you know,
it was a phenomenal thing for me because it was worth the
investment.
So,
you know,
it wouldn't have been without those strains being in Mendo
with Mike that a fishing out,
it just ended up starting to happen.
You know,
it just came as a natural process of,
I was definitely influenced by Shiloh,
but I was able to take the strains that I had.
I collected,
you know,
I made with Mike and I had myself as an,
as a,
as a way to,
you know,
communicate,
you know,
what if we could be,
you know,
one of the best players in Mendo Sino and how could we
communicate that?
And then,
you know,
we ended up winning the cup,
our first cup in 2012.
And that kind of really,
you know,
really helped,
you know,
launch us into orbit with,
with people,
you know,
knowing who we were,
more buyers came up to us,
you know,
more people that wanted,
you know,
a certain flavor.
We were really good with gas.
I got really lucky with that.
You know,
my OG was really good at,
you know,
selecting things for gas,
crossing things for gas.
And,
you know,
my later friend,
my friend,
Matt Atkinson,
who founded Probiotic Farmer's Alliance and Grokashi,
he was really good at selecting for gas and selecting for
good flavor too.
And so,
you know,
learning from all these people,
having that,
you know,
that,
you know,
opportunity to,
you know,
to meet Shiloh through Alan and to,
to get my first glimpse at,
you know,
what really the cannabis industry was like the above ground
cannabis industry.
That was a different world for me.
I was completely off grid and black,
you know,
for a long time.
You know,
I was kicked out of the army.
So when I was kicked out of the army,
it was like,
fuck,
it's either sink or swim.
And I definitely ain't getting a job.
So I had to make it work,
you know?
So,
you know,
transitioning from straight,
you know,
the underworld to seeing this kind of medical quasi medical,
you know,
cannabis movement happening in Cali was,
was just fucking mind blowing.
You know,
it was like,
it was a different world for me.
So that's really,
you know,
what Fishing Auto was born out of.
And at what point did you decide to bring Frenchie on board?
And more importantly,
it was kind of like a bit of a full thinking thought on your
part.
What was it about Frenchie that you thought like,
this is going to bring something new,
a twist to the usual.
We,
he met,
I met him after I got off the stage and woke up in 2012.
Cause I remember he cut,
he came up to me and he was,
he gave me this big hug.
You didn't even know me.
And he was just like really happy that he was like,
cause a lot of people,
when they win the cup,
you know,
they,
they basically pull their dick out and they flex,
you know?
And I never thought I would,
was going to win.
Fuck all.
I was like,
if I get top 20,
I'm at least part of the cool kid crowd.
You know what I mean?
I just wanted to be acknowledged as a grower.
That was my thing.
I just wanted like my whole,
you know,
it wasn't like I bred so I could keep growing fire for
myself.
And so I could keep hitting the highest ticket possible.
You know what I mean?
But when I met Frenchie,
man,
he was just really happy that when I won,
I thanked my soil guy.
I thank Jim Rogoff for making me the,
some of the dankest compost in the world.
And I was just,
you know,
super humbled,
you know,
just to,
you know,
to,
to be lucky enough to,
you know,
to be able to express a plant to that level,
you know,
where we got.
And so when Frenchie,
you know,
when I met Frenchie,
it was just kind of like this instant connection.
You know what I mean?
Like,
you know,
when you meet somebody,
you swear you've seen him before,
but you know,
you never seen him before,
you've never even known him before.
And that was the thing,
you know,
I see this guy,
you get that feeling.
Then he opens a jar of hash.
I never smelled hash this fucking loud,
man.
It,
it looked like it was some MK Ultra from some growers down
in Santa Cruz.
And,
and I was like,
dude,
I've never smelled hash like this.
He was like,
if your fucking hash doesn't smell as loud or louder than
your flowers and you fucked it up.
And I was like,
dude,
we got to do it.
It was right there.
Like really that,
like,
dude,
you're my hash guy,
like forever.
And we've been loyal to each other ever since,
man.
Like I've never taken other people's opportunities to make
hash with them or have other people make hash.
It was like,
you know,
Frenchie's one of those day ones,
man,
where it's like,
you know,
you have a special connection.
And it was like,
it just ended up,
it wasn't planned.
We,
we ended up just being really compatible.
And we had,
we ended up sharing the same vision.
You know,
he's French and he was a,
he was a bag designer back in the day.
And he has a certain idea for aesthetics and,
and for,
and for refinement.
And that's what I always aspired to,
to have those sensibilities.
You know,
I kind of grew up in,
you know,
my family wasn't rich,
you know,
they were middle-class,
but you know,
I had to earn and work for everything I had as a child,
you know,
nothing was given to me.
So I have,
I've always appreciated people that had that,
that,
that,
that,
that,
that sense of aesthetic that Frenchie has,
that sense of refinement that we all wish we could
pursue at a higher level.
So,
you know,
Frenchie was the biggest blessing,
man.
He was the,
he's been the most solid guy in my life for the past seven
years.
Like,
he's family,
you know,
so I'm really lucky that,
you know,
we share the same vision on a lot of things and,
you know,
when it comes to organic growing,
it comes to where the,
where the company should go.
You know,
Frenchie's definitely,
you know,
he's,
he's the fucking dude where I'm like,
if I make a big move,
I run it by Frenchie first.
Okay,
Frenchie,
what do you think about this?
Yeah,
for sure.
I know what it's like to,
to have a guy like that,
that's solid.
It's good.
So I guess kind of leading into the next question,
the previous idea of like,
you guys are expanding beyond the typical breeder.
And I think that people would commonly identify cookies as
doing this,
you know,
expanding into like a lifestyle type of brand.
Do you feel like this is the natural progression for all
breeders or,
and yeah.
Yeah.
Why the fuck not?
So some breeders are going to choose to participate at that
level and some don't.
You know,
so some won't want to,
and that's up to them.
You know,
I think it's cool,
man.
Like,
why not,
man?
If your shit's that hot and people want to support you and
hop and hop on your train,
then man,
that's a,
that's,
that's a cool thing,
man.
Like I respect people's hustle.
A lot of people like to hate on people's hustle,
but a lot of people forget that these are just ideas one
day,
you know,
and they,
and they,
and they fruited.
Now they're now it's fruited into a huge fucking brand.
That took a lot of work.
You know what I mean?
And so it's like,
if a breeder is willing to do that and do all that work,
man,
you know,
I fucking salute you.
You know,
I have my own plans for how I want to express my merchandise,
you know,
later in the future.
But,
you know,
it was just to me,
I wanted to really,
you know,
I really want to focus on that craft and not go,
all right,
you know,
because once you start,
you know,
I'm a control freak.
So if I,
if I did that,
I'd have to control the,
you know,
the,
the merchandising and the branding of it all.
But for me,
it was just as a breeder,
I wanted to focus on that craft.
So when the time comes for me to branch out,
then,
you know,
hopefully it will be the right time and I'll execute it.
Right.
But I think breeders,
I think it's great,
man.
Turn it into a huge lifestyle break.
Cause it is a lifestyle.
People hate on everything,
but this is like the cannabis lifestyle is fucking amazing.
And it's a lifestyle that when you're in it,
you never want to leave it.
And everybody dreams of being in it.
And so,
you know,
I don't understand why people,
you know,
hate on these brands,
you know,
because Jungle Boys gets a lot of flack,
you know,
and we can,
and a lot of people around the globe could talk a lot of
shit about Jungle Boys,
but why is,
why are they the only one making that hustle work the way
they're working it?
You know what I mean?
There's like that there's magic in that you feel me?
It's like their whole concept approach to branding.
I don't know these guys.
Frenchy knows him.
He's really cool with them,
but I just respect hustles in general.
Cause all this shit came from fucking nothing.
You know what I mean?
And you're able to connect with people in this manner,
where they want to wear your fucking clothes and support
you and communicate to the world that these are the
motherfuckers I support,
whether you agree with it or not.
It's like music.
Not everybody listens to Future.
Not everybody listens to,
to these new rappers.
Some people would choose to listen to older rappers like
Biggie and Tupac,
but that's at your discretion.
But that doesn't negate the fact that these clientele are
there and people want to fucking support these motherfuckers.
People want to get behind certain brands and be like,
this is,
this is my identity.
I'm a weed person.
And I identify with this spectrum in the weed community.
Like that's fucking cool, man.
I think there should be more brands that come out and flex
and try to do a lifestyle brand because if you're raw and
it's real,
they'll catch on.
Yeah.
Certainly.
What is, what's the saying?
Real, real, deceased real or whatever.
God.
Yeah.
Real like, yeah, that was like a,
I didn't learn that one until I came in the industry either.
Like, like the above ground industry,
like this whole real recognized real shit.
You know what I mean?
I didn't have that when I was hustling,
it was like, were you on time?
And was the money right?
You know what I mean?
It's like not real recognized real is this motherfucker
does what he says, you know what I mean?
And so it's like the whole real record.
I mean, it's like, it's subjective.
Yeah.
What's real.
You know what I mean?
Let's, I mean, to me, to me, what's real is like, you know,
I look at as authenticity in the game.
Yeah.
You know, at least sacrificed it.
And you really, you were really, you know,
you were really in the culture, you know,
working for, you know, working to better your craft
and really going to the shows, connecting with people,
you know, that's the real work.
That's the real hustle.
You know what I mean?
Yeah. Yeah.
I think there's, there's definitely tivots of truth.
You can draw from it.
Like the idea of, are you doing what's good for you
or what's good for you as well as good for the community?
Yeah. I mean,
It's an interesting one, but.
Yeah. That's like fucking, it's a good one.
It's like, you know,
do you want to do what's good for the community
or do you want to break boundaries?
So it's like, if you want to do what's good for community,
you wanted to sell the a hundred dollar eighth.
But if you want to break boundaries and make history,
you sell a hundred dollar eighth.
So it's like, what do you do?
I'm the kind of person I'd rather make history.
You know what I mean?
So it's like, you know,
a lot of people in the community were against
the high prices of a Fishin' Auto back in the day,
but we wanted to make a point.
It wasn't because we, you know,
we thought we were the best breeders, you know,
cause you know, I was working with Mean Gene back then
and Don and Q and it was about showing
the fucking very best the Emerald Triangle had to offer.
So I think it's like, you know,
how do you want to communicate to the world what you do?
Yeah, totally.
Well, that brings us to the next question I was going to say
the pricing of seeds is an interesting topic.
And in the past, you guys have copped a bit of flack
for the seed pricing.
How would you generally answer someone who was say critical
of a more expensive pricing model in general?
It better be good.
It better be good.
That's the only reason why it works, you know?
And you know, let me say this straight up for everybody.
When you're playing genetics, it's a game of statistics.
It's just a matter of time
before you release something that's not good.
It's, there's going to be some seeds
in a fire ass batch of seeds
that aren't going to work out for people.
You know what I'm saying?
So if you're going to compete at a certain price point,
your testing better be on point.
Your selection better be on point
or you're going to get fucking roasted.
You know what I mean?
You have to have incredibly high standards.
And I think like, depending on how you choose
to price your seeds, that's the hardest part.
What is this worth?
You know what I mean?
Just because you say it's worth something
doesn't mean people are going to buy it.
That's the hard part about that.
You know, it's like, you know, we got lucky.
You know, we tend to sell out every year,
but whenever we think about what do we price this at,
you know, that's a huge conversation for us
every single fucking year.
You know, things are changing now.
You know, back in the day when we first came out,
we were, part of aficionado was so we could establish,
you know, one of the world's first luxury cannabis brands.
But really it was, we wanted to sell to the kind of guys
we were selling packs to.
We wanted to sell people that like,
didn't look like weed people,
but were moving a lot of money in the weed industry.
A lot of your growers don't look like weed people.
They look like regular people.
And those are the kind of guys I wanted to market to.
I was like, if you were willing to spend $500
on a box of seeds, you either, one,
would do everything fucking possible to make sure
you're gonna grow the fucking shit
of that $500 box of seeds,
or two, you're raw enough where you're going,
damn, I got 10 seeds.
Worst case scenario, I'll get 50% females.
That's five plants.
Back in the day, the reasoning was like,
oh, five plants, that's five to eight pounds of plant.
You know what I'm saying?
I'm gonna make my investment way over, you know?
But that market dynamic doesn't exist anymore.
You know what I mean?
Now, phyrogenetics are accessible
at all kinds of price points.
So when it comes to pricing,
we're always gonna have a high price point strain,
because there's things that we've been working on
for a while and that just stand out.
But it's definitely something that needs to change
with the times.
We're always gonna have our $500 to $800 boxes of strains.
Those will sell out, and people always auction those.
We don't have control over that.
That inflates the value, too.
I also know what it's like to not have the money
to spend on $500 boxes of seeds.
So we definitely have some more accessible strains
coming out this year for people that wanna be able
to experience it, but we'll offer at a lower price point.
Is it gonna be less quality?
We're actually, some of our best we're gonna put
at that lower price point.
You know what I mean?
Just to make a point, because we understand that.
But it's a difficult concept when people talk
about pricing, because it also goes in your brand.
What's the goal of your price?
You know what I mean?
I'm only gonna make these strains once,
so that's why we price them that way.
But I think if you're gonna make them over and over,
then they have to not be, then that level
of prestige pricing doesn't work.
You're gonna end up frying yourself.
People are gonna feel like they got cheated,
or you're gonna turn into another Doggy's Nuts.
Remember Doggy's Nuts back in the day?
They were selling $700 seed packs,
and everybody was upset with them.
Yeah, I remember that.
Like, who's gonna come out of the blue
selling $700 seed packs?
You know what I mean?
Yeah, okay, so it brings up a good question.
What would you say to someone if they were after
one of your more expensive strains specifically,
but they just didn't really have the financial freedom
to get it?
Do you have any kind of creative solutions?
Usually, we hear a lot of these,
I stay off the gram.
I don't do any business on IG.
That's my role.
So, it kinda sucks I can't interface with consumers
on that level on IG.
Because when we do have that interface,
it's usually at a show.
You know, I meet all kinds of people at shows.
There's like, you know, they'll show us a lot of love,
and they'll be like, yo, really,
I don't have enough money for this, but I have this.
I'll hook you up, man.
It's like, you know, especially like, you know,
I give a lot at the show.
Like, for a year, they didn't want me to sell seeds
at the show, because they were like, bro,
you hook everybody up.
You're too fucking nice.
You're like, you know, because I really just want people
to grow, you know?
Like, aficionado of the brand and the pricing
is to show the world, this is the potential
of Northern California.
So, I want people to stop taking it seriously.
I'm trying to do something for us, so we can, you know,
so I'm trying to be a part of this ecosystem
so more people could, you know, build up this ecosystem
to make more high-end brands across the world.
You know, I mean, across California.
Yeah, well, I think you could argue
it'll extend across the world.
I don't think a lot of people are familiar
with your refund policy, but let's just kind of put it
into question form.
What would you say to someone if they said
they were kind of unhappy with a pack of your seeds
or something along those lines?
And does that ever really happen?
Yeah, it happens all the time.
I mean, it's genetics, you know what I'm saying?
Everyone has different rooms and environments.
It's not gonna, it's a fucking seed.
And so, it depends.
Everybody grows differently.
And our seeds are grown in a certain environment.
So, it definitely happens.
But I try to make an effort, you know,
if we've had a few email accounts shut down
and get hacked over the past few years.
So, it's been, you know, kind of hard for us
to get back to people.
But we always try to replace the packs.
Especially if it's at a show, I'll just hook you up.
If you're like unhappy and you show me your certificate,
like this was garbage, it's like, I'll just give you a pack.
Like, here you go.
You know, but if you hold onto the seeds,
you don't open them, we'll buy it back from you.
So, you know, we'll only pay the wholesale price
because that's what we get paid.
We'll pay you what we get paid.
You know what I mean?
And I do that every year.
I can't wait till people come up to the booth.
Can't wait for that shit.
People to fucking sell me back my seeds.
Because the first three years we sold everything.
Like, everything.
So, you know, we didn't have a whole lot
of white cashmere seeds left.
We probably had like 20, 30 of those left.
And so, like, when someone came by the booth last year
and they sold me back,
they wanted me to buy back two boxes of cashmere.
I gave them, you know, more than the wholesale price
at that point, because I really wanted those fucking packs.
Yeah, and it's an interesting point.
And I think that it might be something
which continues into the future.
Do you think that's just a part of the high kind of prestige
and value of the brand?
Or do you think this might even be adopted by users?
The function of it was, so your strains always have value.
You know, Louis Vuitton follows a certain model.
That's why you never find a Louis Vuitton
at a fucking thrift store.
Because if you take a real, authentic Louis Vuitton,
Burstback Louis Vuitton, they'll give you cash for it.
It always holds a cash value.
And I was inspired by that.
When doing Aficionado, I was like,
you know, if these things are still sealed up
and the vials and the boxes are set up in a way
so we can preserve these fucking things, you know,
I'll buy it back.
We'll buy it back.
And we thought that was a great thing.
I'm stoked every time someone keeps a box long enough
for me to buy back.
Because chances are, I probably don't have boxes
of that strain because we sell everything.
You know, we sell everything.
We make new stuff every year.
And, you know, that's just how it is.
So over the past, say, five to 10 years,
at least as far as I can see,
there's been this growing demand
for the use of growing from seed outdoors.
There's plenty of advantageous reasons,
particularly the taproot
and all the benefits it brings with it.
With that in mind, do you consider the idea
of catering to these kinds of outdoor growers
who are looking for like your 50 or your 100 pack seeds?
Yeah, so when you were local in Mendocino and Humboldt,
there was this rule for a long time.
If you knew me, if you knew me personally
or you knew me through a friend,
I'd give you free seeds if you lived anywhere
between Arcata and Ukiah.
So for the longest time, I was, you know,
and that was kind of the thing with,
back in the day when I was working with me and Gene
is we always had the homies come by the booth
and we always gave them seeds.
Because we came in from a point,
it was like, even though,
like when I was making my own seeds
and doing my own thing before Aficionado,
I was like just giving them away to people.
Like, hey, see how this is.
This is something I made, you know,
with Mike back in the day, you know what I mean?
Like, tell me how it is.
And so it's like, I've always given the homies seeds.
So it's like, what am I gonna do?
I'm gonna charge you now that I have a company?
So it's like, I always made an effort to show love
to the growers that made all the magic.
I always saw the growers in Humboldt and Mendocino
as the key clientele that could help our strains
reach a new level.
So when it came to those guys, you know, hell yeah.
But these are mostly on a personal basis
where I'll break you off like 50 to 100 seeds
to sift through, you know?
But we're seeing that that's going away now.
You know, the days of growing big ass outdoor plant patches,
you know, that's gonna get smaller and smaller
because the name of the game now is clones
and tissue culture and getting that consistent canopy.
So, you know, the breeding is gonna change according to that.
We're always gonna breed for outdoors.
We're always gonna breed for outdoor people.
We're always gonna have those strains
because that's what we are before anything.
I was a fucking outdoor grower, you know?
That's like, that was my passion.
And so like, you know, we'll make some strains indoors
but we'll always make our best strains outdoors
under the sun.
That's a rule we just can't fucking deviate from.
And do you believe that seeds produced organically
under the sun give like the most healthiest
and optimal seeds or do you think that-
100%, 100%.
People say it doesn't matter.
And I go, okay, cool.
Cool, let's take your pregnant wife,
stick her in a closet for nine months,
feed her pizza and fucking soda, you know,
put a light on her, she'll probably survive
but I guarantee that fucking baby
ain't gonna turn out good.
You know what I mean?
And so it's like the inputs,
30,000 genes are in the cannabis plant.
Every input matters, right?
And so if we look at that and we're geneticists,
we're like, all right, I wanna give this DNA
everything it needs to be successful for the next person
that's gonna work these lines.
I need to give this genetic everything
that it evolved to uptake and have.
I mean, people forget that.
This phenomenon of cultivation is wholly happened
in the span of the last 60 years.
You know what I mean?
And in big cannabis cultivation,
this phenomenon has only happened,
you know, fuck, the last 10 years.
And so it's like, people have to also remember
like this plant evolved for millions of years
under sunlight and organic inputs.
And that's just a fucking fact.
So when it comes, so that's our core philosophy
is providing the plant genetics,
everything that it needs,
you know, everything that it evolved to excel with,
you know, and then we'll try to supercharge that aspect.
But I think that nutrition of your seeds is so important.
Man, when I see people fertilizing seeds
with salt-based nutrients, I'm like, it's not the same.
It's not the fucking same.
You take two prize fighters, right?
You could take two prize fighters.
Like let's say we take two clones
and you fucking make seeds that are inorganic
with salt-based inputs, grown on a walk wall,
and you make seeds that are made in soil
that have a high amino acid content,
have, you know, a high content of organic matter,
have high content of minerals, you know,
because a lot of the problems isn't an NPK problem
in plants, it's a mineral deficiency.
So it's like, you know, in genetics,
the genetic building blocks are all built
on these essential minerals and amino acids, you know?
So it's like, it's essential to have these inputs
present in the soil and present in your regimen
to just get your fucking seeds in your babies
to have their very best start.
So if you take a prize fighter and you feed one,
you know, you feed one the right diet he's supposed to eat
and the other one, you feed him vodka and pizza
before a fucking fight, you know,
you're definitely gonna see the difference.
You know what I'm saying?
I see the difference in people's genetics
when they make seeds without organic inputs.
I see a distinct difference.
Yeah, totally.
So how would you feel about people making F2s and F3s
of your line for their own use?
And I guess in general, how do you feel
about people breeding with your work?
That's the biggest gift you could do for me.
It's like, you know, people think that the gift stops
when you buy the seeds and you grow it out.
But man, when you choose to F2 it, F3 it, F4 it,
man, that's awesome.
Kill it, get it, man.
Make that line your line.
Because at least you're working it.
They're doing the work.
You know what I mean?
There's a lot of work that goes into that shit.
And so it's like, anybody who's willing to do that, man,
like nothing but love and respect, man.
Like, fuck, let's share some seed stock.
Give me some of yours, I'll give you some of mine.
You know, there's all kinds of opportunities for that, man.
So when I see people work with genetics, man,
it's just like the greatest gift.
It's like the best complete circle to me.
It's better than selling the seeds.
To me, that's the validation as a breeder.
When not only has it expressed itself good enough
for flower to meet their expectations,
but it's exceeded their expectations to a point
where they choose to continue working that line.
And to that's just the hugest, most humbling gift to me.
So in a previous episode, we had Mean Gene on
and he said he really enjoyed all the work
he's done with Aficionado.
But one thing he felt was that it carried a bit of a labor
with it for like being the absolute best.
And he said that he just felt like
that was a lot of pressure.
Do you kind of agree with that?
Do you feel the pressure sometimes?
I remember when Gene was talking about that, man.
Cause he would have, every year,
he'd have something that was crazy fire.
And but it would be the,
but I don't think it's good enough for Aficionado.
Like having to meet that bar is pretty fucking stressful.
I'll tell you what, bro.
Just to keep doing that and meeting these expectations
is I think I was a little short-sighted
when I first came up with that concept,
but I'm already all the way in.
I gotta keep swimming.
I can't drown now.
I gotta keep swimming.
I gotta hold that line.
And so I 100% feel Gene on that.
And like, you know, when you're trying to meet that level
of quality and expectation,
it's almost unsustainable.
Really, if you really think about it,
if you wanna be hella real,
like it's almost unsustainable.
And so I think it also,
it also inhibits you from making other experiments
you wouldn't otherwise,
cause you're so focused on putting the best out.
And you're always so focused on having the most elite shit.
I mean, look at what Symbiotic did with Larry OG and GDP.
They created the purple punch.
You don't fuck what you say.
That's just not hype.
That's beautiful.
I've sifted it this year.
That's crazy.
You know what I mean?
It's like, so, you know,
when you're in this mindset of like, man,
we only have to put the most exclusive genetics,
the best possible genetics on the market.
I mean, I think it kind of takes away from the artistry
cause you're always trying to meet a certain expectation.
You're not doing it just for the love of the game.
You know, and I gotta be real, you know,
when Gene and I kind of went on our separate ways,
I think that was a point in my game personally,
when I don't think my head was all the way in it.
I think that was probably one of those that year,
I think based on just how long I've been doing shit,
I got lucky with my selections.
You know what I mean?
I got lucky with the selections
and I was able to meet a certain mark
and expectation for people.
But it's tough.
It's tough trying to fucking always hold that line
and do it.
Like what Gene's doing right now with his lines is crazy.
It's really cool.
You know, he could do anything he fucking wants, you know,
like that.
And that's music to me.
You know what I mean?
So you could do anything you want, that's freedom.
You know, you could really make good music.
So that's one of the reasons why we started
a French Connection with my partner, Professor Q.
But it's an outlet for us to be able to explore
a lot of these more contemporary flavors
and find new flavors that necessarily don't fit
the aficionado paradigm of what people expect.
But, you know, are something that can still exceed
all expectations.
You know what I mean?
Like, you know, the genetics, you know,
Symbiotic and Sea Junkie are working with,
they're not the most crazy exclusive genetics,
but they're incredibly good breeders.
And that's why the quality comes out of it.
They're able to select and find things out of, you know,
normally found strains, you know, and some rare strains
and create something entirely fucking different
and pivotal, you know?
So that's the magic of it.
So, you know, going back to your thing with like,
you know, yeah, it was hella fucking hard.
I can't blame him.
You know what I mean?
I can't blame him.
Yeah.
So tell us a little more about Professor Q.
I don't think people are as familiar with him
as they are yourself.
Man, so we're in Spanibus two years ago, right?
Frenchy goes to Spanibus a week before me
to do about two classes.
And I tell Frenchy before he goes to Spain,
I'm like, I'm looking for the fucking skunk Frenchy.
At the time, you know, before Duke Diamond
released all the skunk crosses and stuff,
you know, we were talking to James.
You know, there was a bounty, you know,
everybody had a bounty on skunk, right?
So I was like, I'm gonna find this, you know,
cause you know, that was the unique edge
I had in a fishing auto.
Wasn't that, not that was the best breeder.
I was really able to find good genetics
cause I was able to find the good pounds, you know?
I was awesome.
Right, so we find a good pounds.
And I was like, who's the farmer?
Who does this, right?
So with Quentin, Frenchy puts the word out at his class
to all the French cronies.
He goes, I'm looking, we're looking for skunk.
And then two weeks passes by, we're at Spanibus
and these two shady ass looking fucking French gangsters
come up to the table with a big iPad.
And they're like, are you Leo?
We're looking for Leo.
And I tell my partners at the booth,
it's like, it's about to get heavy guys.
I don't know what they want,
but it's gonna be ugly.
And they had these mean mugs, mean mugging ass faces.
And a dude looks at me, he's like, we represent Quentin.
He's like, we heard you looking for the skunk.
And they pull out the iPad
and they show me pictures of the skunk.
It looks like skunk.
You know, they said they got it from Hypro.
And you know, this, the French people
been holding it directly from Hypro
who got it from Flying Dutchman.
So it's like a verified Flying Dutchman cut
of the roadkill skunk.
And so they show me a sample of the hash
and I'm like, well, where's this dude at?
He's like, well, he doesn't wanna come in Spanish,
but he wants to meet you at like, you know,
he wants to meet you at a private location.
So I'm like, all right, this is kind of weird.
So, you know, he tells us where to meet him.
We meet him at this bar.
And then we go, we're at this bar
and the waitress is super nice to this fucking guy.
And he's the most humble guy.
He's like, he's just some tall guy.
He looks kind of, he looks like a gangster,
but he's like the most humble, you know, calm,
you know, soft-spoken dude, you know,
you'd ever fucking meet, you know?
And so we were just talking and he was like,
yeah, I have the skunk and, you know,
I wanna, you know, I wanna offer it to you guys.
I wanna be able to work with you guys.
And he was like, come up to the countryside
near the French border.
I wanna show you my place.
And so, you know, after the cup,
you know, after Spanibus, we went to his place, man.
And he lived in the most beautiful part of Spain
outside this town called Girona.
This is where they filmed a lot of the episodes
of Game of Thrones.
And so he had this grow there that was so fucking clean,
you could eat it off the floor.
And he was so passionate about, you know,
working with aficionado.
He was like, I'll give all this up
to have a chance to work with you.
And he left it at that.
And then for like the next week,
he showed us the most beautiful places of Spain
and we just chilled.
It wasn't any business.
And I just had a really good feeling about it.
I mean, this dude could look at any fucking plant
and tell you the scientific name of it.
It's like ridiculous.
And he went to France's, you know,
their equivalent to MIT of horticulture.
And it's the University of Antibes
where he specialized in tissue culture and breeding.
And so it was kind of like meeting him
was almost as fucking magical as meeting Frenchy.
Like that was made to happen.
And then it just so happens that the guy
that's kind of Quentin's OG from back in the day
in Nice, France was Frenchy's homie
they were partying with in Goa.
It's fucking crazy.
Like, how does this happen?
It's just like, we didn't, I was like, dude, this is crazy.
It's like, you know, and so Quentin had to come,
you know, he came to California and, you know,
we restructured the company.
And I was like, bro, you know, you're my fucking dude.
You know, I wanna like,
let's take over the world together.
And so, you know, now he's a full partner and aficionado.
And he's like, you know, he was definitely, you know,
one of the best breeders, best botanist,
horticulturist I've ever met, man.
He's one of the most passionate people
about plants you'd ever fucking meet.
One of the most knowledgeable people about botany.
It's unreal.
He's like, how do you know so many scientific plant names
and where they come from?
Like, that's just unreal.
He's not just a cannabis person.
He's a fucking plant person.
That's like the magic of Professor Q, you know?
So him having the skunk was just like an entry into,
you know, just scratching the iceberg
of like this guy's potential.
You know, like me and Frenchie looked at him,
we were like, you know, talking,
he was like, man, this guy's gonna be fucking huge one day.
He was gonna be huge, you know?
So, and he was also generally a good guy.
So I was like, look, man, this is why I wanna work with you.
You know, but I don't wanna make the mistakes I've made
with other breeders where I didn't really play my cards
right, so, you know, you're so raw,
you're gonna wanna do your own thing one day.
So let's work on Aficionado
and let's build a company around you too,
your own brand where you could fucking express yourself
and you could be your own person, you know,
and it'd just be kind of like this record label shit.
And he was down and that's how it's been working, you know?
So we both work on Aficionado and then like, you know,
French Connection is our opportunity
to do really exciting things in Europe
with a lot of really badass French operators
because when Frenchie and I went to Spain, it's universal.
The best fucking growers in Europe
are in the UK and France.
I'm sorry to all my French people,
my Spanish people listening, and Alberto,
I know you're in Barcelona right now.
Yes, you're one of the best too.
So, but universally, man, the guys in France and UK,
man, they brought some fucking heat.
We saw some crazy shit, like shit,
the kind of talent where if you brought it to Cali,
you could sell it for Cali prices.
It was that fucking good.
They gave Cali people right for their money.
And so, you know, that was definitely, you know,
Professor Q, that was kind of our whole thing was like,
man, we can make something bigger than Aficionado.
And I'm more comfortable on an international scale anyway.
I grew up in Japan until I was 20,
started my career when I was in Germany.
So going to Europe with Quentin
and doing these new exciting things makes sense
while, you know, we allow Aficionado
to be what it always has been.
Keep it based out of California, keep it pure, you know,
cause we're only gonna release
three to five strains a year anyway
for the rest of this company's life.
Cause you know, we have a very specific focus
for what we wanna do,
but the music we're gonna make with Quentin,
that's what I'm really excited about too.
Sounds exciting.
Are there any other breeders
you plan to do collaborations with?
You know who I just hit up this morning?
Is I hit up Miss Jill.
I hit up Miss Jill cause I've been breeding
a lot of strains.
I've been breeding a lot of strains
more geared towards the female palette.
You know, my sister who's French's apprentice
kind of really inspired me.
She kind of indirectly inspired me on that
cause she liked a certain flavor profile
and her friends liked a certain flavor profile.
And I was like, fuck, I wonder if I could breed for that.
You know what I mean?
So I forgot where I was getting to.
What was your-
Any other breeders you wanna collab with?
Yeah, yeah.
My reason for hitting up Miss Jill was
she's got some of the craziest flavors
that females love,
like the chili bean, the Asian orange,
like these really incredible, exotic,
crazy pronounced tones you don't find a lot of cultivars.
So she was someone I hit up this morning.
I asked her if she was down
and she was like, yeah, man, let's rap later.
So another breeder I'm really looking forward
to doing some work.
You know, we've kind of really collabed
with a lot of breeders.
We always kind of just did our own thing
and made our own music.
But that's something that I definitely wanna change
cause there's a lot of talent out there.
There's a lot of breeders, you know,
I wanna put off the notion
that I'm too good to work with you.
Cause it was never like that.
I was just always in my own world.
I'm pretty reclusive by nature anyway, you know?
So I was just in my own world,
working on my own thing
cause I tend to get distracted easy.
But, you know, being able to work with different breeders,
you know who I wanna work with?
You know, in-house, in-house is killing it right now.
I definitely like to work with him.
You know, he was someone I like to work with.
Compound, these aren't guys I'm planning to work with.
These are just guys I'm fans of
because their compounds work really good.
And, you know, if I could collab with a breeder one day,
whoever's running symbiotic,
I think it's Budologist 420, but I could be wrong.
But whoever's doing their breeding
is doing some incredible work.
Like I sifted through their purple punch F2s
and I just can't believe you got that expression
out of GDP and OG.
Like what the fuck did you select for
to get it to look like that?
Like that's, like what he did
was what I always try to do.
You know what I mean?
So, and 303 Seeds, some cat out of fucking Colorado,
believe it or not.
You know, it's like,
California guys kinda hate on Colorado guys,
but we just gotta be real, man.
There's some cats in Colorado that bring some flame.
And 303 Seeds was one of them.
They did the G6 Jet Fuel.
And that was, he was able to get an expression of sour
that I've been trying to get for seven years.
You know, he nailed it on the G6 Jet Fuel.
You know what I mean?
So, if I could work with someone,
it'd be someone definitely like that too, you know?
Yeah.
So on the flip side, what are just some general genetics,
whether it be land race or modern
that you kinda wanna work into an aficionado strain?
Well, like we've been sifting
through the Lebanese for a while.
That's gonna turn into a long-term project
because you could cross things with things
that sound exotic, but is the end product gonna be exotic?
You know, so we're really gonna open up the Urkel.
We're gonna, you know,
a lot of these really exciting flavors come from Urkel.
So, you know, the essence of Royal Kush,
I always thought that, you know,
Mandelbrot was trying to go towards the sour D side
of things with the Royal Kush
until I finally grew his F1 clone,
the Magnum Opus and the original release of Long Valley
directly next to a Urkel.
And I was like, holy fuck.
And it wasn't, you know, it was literally till last year.
I saw that observation.
I was like, holy fuck.
That's what he was selecting for.
That's where all those crazy flavors
in the original Royal Kush 7 coming from.
It wasn't coming from the Ghani.
It wasn't coming from the sour.
I mean, it was complimented by that, but man,
those crazy tense piercing fruit tones
were coming from the Urkel.
And so I'm definitely going back into the Urkel again,
doing some exploring into there.
And we made a crazy cross last year
with one of the contemporary strains, Great Pie.
We got one of the cuts of Great Pie
from one of our buddies at Humboldt.
The cut came from LA and we crossed it
with the Rose Especial.
And we just were like, we'll see what's gonna happen.
And so we didn't really pop the seeds this year.
We had Royal Key, Josh from Royal Key Organics
ran the seed and he found some crazy shit.
He ended up giving us two males back.
We floured the males out and there were some
of the frostiest males we've ever seen.
So that's something we're gonna explore
that cultivar a lot more next year
and see what we could select,
see if it meets certain expectations.
And I'm really excited about working the original Diesel.
I met Strawberry Jerry from,
God damn, I can't remember his fucking company name.
He released, Strawberry Jerry,
he's a super talented breeder from the East Coast.
And he's got a back cross of the original Diesel mutter.
But that's Sour Diesel, original Diesel,
the mom that made Sour Diesel.
So he's got a back cross of that
and that's definitely something I'm really excited to work.
And I've kind of been collecting pollen
and storing a few things.
Because Capulator gave us, he gifted Leo from Blockchain
to give to me a pack of this orange apricot
times Mac crossed our chem dogs, special reserve.
So Leo ended up keeping the two females out of that.
And we ran all the males in our indoor
and the males are fucking crazy.
And so we put the male on one of my white cash mirrors
to see what happened, but we're just gonna test that out.
I have no intention of releasing that.
I make anywhere from like 30 strains a year on average.
But we only release like five to six.
So it's like part of me breeding
is just seeing what things have in them.
You know what I mean?
And how do they cross, how they look.
Not everything that I'm gonna cross,
I'm gonna produce or sell.
A lot of this is for observation.
Just like, you're only gonna be a good breeder
as many strains as you grow and you fuck with too.
So that's why I also see the virtue
in working with other breeders
and collaborating with other breeders.
Getting that extra set of eyes,
getting that extra perspective
on what a certain direction could take.
You know what I mean?
Because I'll be honest, if I didn't have Quentin
here most of the time in Frenchie,
I'd probably be full of shit.
Because you could believe your own shit
you tell yourself in your head.
But if you don't have another informed breeder going,
no, I don't think that's the right direction.
I think we should go this way.
And you could look at it objectively and go,
yeah, you're right, bro.
You know, that's magic.
So these breeders that I'm talking about
that I wanna work with in their strains,
it's because I'm seeing shit in their work
that they're making selections.
They're coming with flavors that nobody else is making.
That's magic.
Yeah, totally.
So I mean, on the topic of creation and whatnot,
seed testing is always a topic of interest to me.
In the past, we used to see people use testers,
but we've steered away from that.
And a lot of people do in-house testing.
Where do you guys sit?
We've never done testers, ever.
We've always, it's always been our policy
to vigorously test in-house.
When you're outsourcing testing,
it's kind of like the risk of licensing.
You're expecting a certain standard to be met
in your absence.
And that's always a risk, right?
Especially with breeders.
Breeders always need to have things a certain fucking way.
And we're the same way too.
It's like, I vigorously test.
We have a vigorous testing program
where the whole time that we test.
So when we test, this is like how we test, right?
So we'll make a strain,
and then we'll test it its first year, outdoors, right?
We'll test it outdoors.
And we get a full six to eight months,
living with the strain, seeing how it works.
And also we take cuts during when it's growing.
We take cuts of the females, we take cuts to the males,
right, one for preservation
and two for fucking stress testing.
You gotta see what's in these strains.
Because when we grow, I'm basically giving the seeds
and their environment the best possible environment.
It's like, it's how you wanna treat your pregnant wife.
You wanna give her just nothing but love
and a comfortable environment and just no stress
so that baby comes out its best possible self, right?
And so we need that to happen in the garden
where things are producing
and where we're getting a feel for cultivating these things
under ideal conditions.
You also have to test things under unideal conditions.
You gotta kinda be a fucking asshole
and subject the girls that you love
to a certain degree of pain.
And especially the boys.
The champagne room,
the reason why we call our mail room the champagne room
is because it's the final place you go
after you get your ass beat in fight club.
Like that's initial male selection for us.
It goes through fight club.
And that's, we have to see
what the fuck this strain can deal with.
And that's really where a lot of your testing
is gonna come from.
Testing as far as like germination,
that's something you should always do in house.
Test the fucking germ on your seeds,
test the progeny, see if they grow out well.
But I think there's also a lot of value
in having other talented growers test your shit too.
I just think you have to be really,
you have to be really a fucking,
you have to be really decisive
on who you choose to work with.
You have to be a lot of trust
and there has to be a set of rules
in an agreement that has to be honored
between the breeder and the guy that's testing it.
Because a lot of the reason people don't like testers
is because things could end up getting stolen.
You don't know certain people's security.
So as a breeder, you just kind of wanna control everything
best possible.
Yeah, totally.
Yeah.
So Aficionado as a brand has a lot of kind of mystery
and kind of mystique around it in my opinion.
With that being said,
what are the types of things you get up to
on an average basis?
Like are you just locked away breeding most of the time?
Yeah.
Short answer.
Yeah, yeah.
So basically it was like my day,
I'm up at five or six every day.
I'm a weed monk.
I get up at five or six every day,
I work out and I do weed all the way until I sleep.
And I think you need that kind of intense focus
to be good at anything.
It's like, I've really butted heads
with this guy in the past
and people know that we've kind of
don't like each other publicly,
but Brandon from third gen,
well, you can love him or hate him.
There's one thing that I learned from him
was I've never seen somebody to work harder
in the industry than that motherfucker.
And so seeing, and a lot of people have,
you could say whatever you can,
but he earned everything he's fucking earned
through hard fucking work.
The guy's talented,
but hard work beats talent every time.
You know what I mean?
I've never seen someone work that intense.
So I've always looked at Brandon
as someone I had to kind of keep up with,
and it was kind of using a rival to your advantage
where you could find inspiration
from someone you don't get along with.
You could kind of see the strengths they have.
So it's like seeing guys at the top of their game,
seeing how many fucking hours they put into their business.
I'm with Kevin Jodry.
That motherfucker's a workaholic.
He's a workhorse.
You know, the dude never stops working.
And that inspires me.
Same thing, and I follow the hip hop industry.
Most successful artists don't fucking sleep.
I mean, they sleep, but they work.
And it takes that level of focus and attention to detail
to be successful at it.
And so it's like, I've gotten through times in my life
where my focus and my cognition is deviated
from where it should be.
But knowing that if I really wanna be in this industry,
make something, I gotta be super fucking disciplined.
You know what I mean?
Like this isn't just because I own,
you know, we have our own business
doesn't mean that we could fuck off.
It's like, you have to be incredibly fucking disciplined
because no matter how hard you're working,
I really feel that there's other people out there
that are more hungry
that are fucking working harder than you
to take away what you have
or to fucking get better at you in the game.
And that's just gonna fucking happen.
So it's like my regular day,
it's like, I have to manage the indoor, the outdoor,
check on emails, check on sales.
Like we have a really small type family
to really small type network.
You know, and we really like to, we operate like we hustle.
We don't like to really share a lot about what we do.
We just like to show people the end product.
We feel that's part of the magic.
When you go to a magic show
and someone shows you how the magic trick is done,
it kind of loses its mystique,
kind of loses, it loses the magic.
And so we figured if we just like
really focus on the fucking craft
and just whenever people see us,
we're just communicating some fire,
and that's our goal, you know?
And so it just takes a certain lifestyle.
Definitely a lot of sacrifice.
You know, I definitely sacrifice partying a lot.
You know, I was partying a lot
when I first started Fishin' Auto,
but now, you know, just I've learned by being in the game
that if you want to be relevant,
you got to work harder than the guy
that's working harder than you to get in the game right now.
So that's what keeps me hungry, you know?
It's like my normal day is busy as fuck.
I'm usually up at five or six, done at 11,
go to bed at 12, do it all over again,
sometimes go to bed at two.
Yeah, wow.
Workaholic by the sounds of it.
Yeah, a little bit, you know,
but it's like, you know,
everybody thinks it's a cool idea
to start their own company until you're actually doing it,
and then you have to see what goes into it.
And then, you know, I have a lot of people
I aspire to kind of, you know, get to the level,
and so I just kind of emulate their work habits
and their intensity when they approach their craft.
Like, you know, certain producers I know
that I really look up to,
and certain businessmen that I know I really look up to,
that they have these work ethics that,
man, if I want to get to that level,
I have to fucking work that hard or harder.
Yeah, totally.
So I guess shout out to Brendan from Third Gen, One Love.
Yeah, yeah, One Love, you know,
like we've, you know, we've, you know,
we've had people publicly know we don't get along,
but my voice is the thing,
it's like, just because I don't like you
doesn't mean I can't respect you, you know what I mean?
And just, you know, like there's always, you know,
everyone's got something about their hustle
and their intensity that if you just put away
your fucking ego, man, you can see,
you can really see the value
these motherfuckers bring to the game.
You know, aside from all the ego show on IG,
it's like no one worked harder than that motherfucker.
That dude worked hard as fuck, you know what I mean?
And same thing with Gene, you know,
no one makes, no one breeds and observes
on a level that Gene does, you know what I mean,
when it comes to breeding.
So it's like, you know, being in proximity to those guys
showed me a standard of where we should operate,
you know what I mean?
And then not abiding by those
and making my mistakes and fuck ups further reinforces
how we should emulate how certain guys like that operate,
that intensity, that dedication, you know what I mean?
So.
Yeah, okay.
It's definitely like a spiritual journey.
So a little bit unrelated, I wanna know,
what's your prediction on the next big thing
to hit the industry or the next big wave,
whatever you wanna call it,
and how do you plan to ride it?
I don't know.
That's a good question.
That's a good question.
I think like, the big thing in what context,
the big thing in like the flower market,
the genetics market, you know,
it's, you know, next big strain, next big phenomenon.
I mean, I really think the next big thing
happened with Big Al, bro.
I think that, you know, it's, is it set in stone?
We can't tell yet.
But is it happening right now?
Is the opportunity here right now?
Fuck yeah.
That's what real people in the industry needed so hard
was to be able to participate at that level
and separate themselves
from the fucking corporate booth squad.
You know, so like to me, that's like, you know,
some people can say that's not a big phenomenon
and motherfuckers are price gouging.
Look, that customer demographic exists.
They're underserved.
It's the reason why Audemars Piguet,
Ferrari and Rolex are in business
as customers of this demographic.
And so it's like, they need to be served.
You know what I'm saying?
It's like, and just because you serve them
at that price point doesn't mean you could offer things
at another price point too.
It's not binary.
You know, cannabis isn't binary.
It's not just, it's not black or white.
You know, so, you know, I think that's like
the biggest thing that's happening to the culture right now
that people really aren't appreciating
is that we have this new opportunity
to really be like wine, to really be like craft spirits,
to really be like high-end Cuban cigars.
So why resist this opportunity
when it's gonna be what's gonna save us
later down the line?
Yeah, totally.
So one of the questions we received
from a few different fans over the period of this show
is that basically they're always interested in knowing
how is it you go about sourcing all of the rare genetics?
I know before you mentioned that it was through,
you know, bags and whatnot,
but obviously some of the stuff you have access to,
which is really old, doesn't come from a bag.
Is it like a real kind of-
No, it wasn't from bags.
When I said in that context,
when the person would bring the packs over,
I'd be like, where's the farmer at?
I wanna meet the farmer.
Ah, there you go.
And if they wouldn't introduce me to the farmer,
I'd give him some fucking fire-ass seeds
or a fire-ass clone.
I was like, dude, introduce me to the farmer, bro.
He's gonna want this clone.
Yeah, okay.
So just in general, how do you go about procuring
these more rare and obscure strains?
Man, all over, you know?
Sometimes, you know, some people will be talking to Frenchie.
You know, I've met, you know, really, it's always different.
You know, back in the day, before everything went legal,
it was really through when I was still, you know,
when I was still really active, you know, doing other things.
It was when I was really collecting the strains,
meeting farmers, you know, driving thousands of miles,
putting thousands of miles on my fucking vehicle every week
just to meet farmers, making deals happen
and so I could find genetics.
But now it's a lot different.
Now it's the culture changed, the landscape changed,
so we're getting our genetics from, you know,
from just random people now.
Like, not random people, but like people that we meet
through our network that we never would have thought
would have brought this.
You know, we have to verify these genetics
and grow them out and see if it's really
what they say it's gonna be.
But a lot of the times, you know,
the hardest part about obtaining genetics
is getting it from a rare source
that's willing to share it.
The game's changed now where a lot of people
really realize the value in their genetics.
So it's getting harder for a lot of breeders
to obtain, you know, new gear unless you're collabing
with people or you're straight up buying seeds.
And I've never been, you know,
I've never been a huge, like, seed collector
in the sense where I collect other companies' packs.
It was like, I want the shit that comes in a Ziploc bag,
you know, that came from fucking Thailand, you know,
or the stuff that we got from Lebanon.
The seeds we got from Lebanon was,
we could congratulate Professor Q,
you know what I mean?
And it was really hard to get those.
They were from, they were late 70s stocks
that was just opened up a couple years ago
and then open pollinated.
And so, and that came directly from Lebanon.
And then we got that, it came from Lebanon
and then it ended up landing in Spain
where we were sifting it.
And so, I don't know how it fucking got to Spain,
but Quentin called me one day and he was like,
dude, I got the Lebanese.
And we were so happy.
We were fucking so happy.
Oh yeah.
You know, finding the strain is the hardest part.
It's like when you look at a producer, right?
When I was mentioning earlier that, you know,
producers' job is, you know,
to create, shape and shift the future of music, you know?
And I have to quote,
Funkmaster Flex was one who says that,
that producers create, shape and shift the future of music.
But also what these producers and DJs do
is they do some, they have this culture of digging
where they go through and they dig through records
so they can find new sounds.
And where you obtain these new records
and these new tracks and how you obtain them
is always a fucking secret to DJs.
You know, a lot of people are like back in the day,
you know, motherfuckers always ask other producers, DJs,
like, hey, where are you getting these tracks
or where are you getting these samples from?
That's part of their magic
and how they acquired seeds, you know?
Like I've always just had a really,
you know, that was kind of one of the weird things
I fell into.
I was just, I ended up getting really lucky
at finding good genetics because of business pipelines.
And so I just keep following those pipelines.
I just keep, you know, I keep, you know,
networking with people and I share a lot of genetics too.
So it's like, it's not like I'm just like,
look going out, looking for shit.
I'm like, you know, I have a lot of things on my vault
that I'm like, hey, you know, what are you looking for?
Is there anything you want?
And then, you know, I'll make that happen, you know,
or to the best of my ability.
It's usually the best way we can get strains.
Yeah, for real.
So just trade them, you know?
Do you feel like breeding with heirloom
or land-raised strains is able to help you remove
what we would maybe refer to as the ceiling
or that inability to continue to get more and more high,
which doesn't seem to be occurring
in like land-raised and heirloom varieties?
I don't know, man.
It's really difficult breeding land-raised
and heirloom varieties.
It sounds exotic until you're actually doing it, you know?
And then you have to go out
and you have to make the crosses and test it.
You know, with a lot of these contemporary strains,
you could tell from the mother stock and what you select
that you're gonna have a good probability
of getting something that's gonna meet
a certain level of expectation.
But when you're working with land-raised,
your selection has to be fucking incredibly on point.
There's a lot of really garbage land-raised,
but there's a lot of really good stuff,
but it's really difficult to access.
And so, you know, for me,
a lot of these really difficult ones to access
that I was been searching for years was, you know,
the broadleaf Burmese, old school Burmese.
The one that looks like OG.
You know, I smoked the Burmese.
My first trip when I went to,
I grew up in Japan until I was 20.
The first time I went to Thailand, I was like 18.
And my buddies came out and was like,
hey, we were in the smoke weed at the time
because weed is expensive as fuck in Japan.
It was 70 bucks a gram.
And so when we went to Thailand,
you know, it was just like smoke heaven.
And I remember having a Burmese that was rock fucking hard.
And it was one of the craziest highs I've ever had.
So I've been kind of chasing one of those strains.
It was really frosty.
It was like exceedingly frosty.
You know, some of the weed we were getting in Japan,
a lot of it was coming from Mexico.
If it was coming in nug form
or it was getting smuggled in from Cali,
from on the Navy ships with the sailors,
and then they'd sell it to kids.
And, but when we went to Thailand,
that was the first time I got to see like really good weed.
I got really lucky.
It wasn't hydraulically pressed or anything.
And so it was something like that.
That was the standard what I wanted to chase.
You know, same thing with like an Afghani,
like a real Afghani,
or like an incredible Pakistani that has not just frost,
but a nose.
You know, so you see a lot of these old hash varieties,
like they'll be crazy frosty,
but they won't really have like a definitive nose.
Something that you could breed with
and that you're really certain that you're gonna get,
you know, a new and exciting flavor from.
You know, so it's like, it's really,
I've learned through trial and error
that when you're breeding land races,
it's more of a long-term project.
And a lot of it's gonna be more research and development
and recording your observations,
because it's gonna take some time
to get that land race cross to express itself
in a manner that's gonna meet the expectations
of what strains are doing these days.
You know, with shit that fucking, you know,
symbiotic and see junkies releasing
these crazy frosty profiles, like that's the new standard.
So it's like, if you wanna breed with land race strains
that historically don't have these exaggerated
frost profiles, it's gonna be more of a, you know,
it's, you better have a fucking good direction
you're gonna go if you wanna release that.
Yeah.
That's at least my two cents, you know,
and there's people that work a lot of land races
that have really good working as AK Bean Brains
in the nature farm on IG.
These guys are crowing some crazy fucking land races,
really rare shit, and that's cool.
I think those guys might end up being
some of the next big guys in the game.
I've been seeing some crazy phenotypes and collection
coming out of their fucking feeds.
I'm just like, how the fuck did you get that?
You know what I mean?
But it's like, that's the magic, you know what I mean?
How did you get that?
The fact is they got that and it's exotic
and they're gonna be able to flex crosses
their land races that are gonna hopefully prove themselves
to be just as good, if not better than a lot
of these contemporary polyhybrids we're seeing on the market.
Of course.
So something I realized I haven't asked you,
what type of cannabis is your personal favorite?
Are you into stuff that's kind of like gonna
more work you out?
Oh, stimuli.
Stuff that'll sell.
I mean, I love gas.
Like, really, my first love is gas.
I have a really, I get gas plants,
I get along with them really well
as far as growing and smoking them.
But man, my love is haze, man.
I love that crazy, you know, it looks like someone
just plucked your third eye out
and just threw it in the outer space.
Like, that's what I want.
The first time I smoked the C5 haze in Spain
was a crazy experience.
It was like a 16-week flower.
It didn't look, it looked airy as fuck.
It was pretty frosty.
It didn't really have a crazy, unique nose
that I can remember right now and go,
oh, it's this flavor.
I just remember the high was so intense.
I don't remember the flavor, bro.
And I was sitting in this house
and a great gardener says to smoke it.
It's just all the way up.
Like, what do you mean?
It's just straight up.
What the fuck you mean?
Smoke it straight up.
All right, so I smoke it and literally it feels
like someone grabs the side of your head
and lifts you straight the fuck up.
I haven't had such a visceral sativa high like that
since I was a little kid in Thailand.
And so it's like, my favorite weeds are always gonna be
those old school sativas that kind of get hated on
because they take a long time to flower out.
Because to me, it's about the high.
Yeah, everyone says, oh, this is medicine.
Yeah, it is fucking medicine.
I got PTSD, I use it medicinally.
But really, my form of medicine is getting
to this certain high so I could interface life
at a different frequency, you know what I mean?
And so to me, the haze high did that.
And I'll be real too.
With the other straight, I love smoking.
I fucking love, because the high just makes sense to me,
it's Skittles, you know what I'm saying?
Some people either hate that shit or they love it.
So it brought me a similar happy, heady high
that I get when I smoke a lot of the old school
and the contemporary hazes you find in Europe nowadays.
I don't like being really stoned and sleepy
because I'm busy as fuck all day.
So I like something that's going to really pick me up
and get me going, almost like a proper sour diesel,
you know, where you're noticeably high,
but you're not impaired to the point
where it's gonna inhibit productivity.
Yeah, so on that note of gassy,
we've mentioned it earlier, the Chem Special Reserve.
It's one of the popular ones I hear about people,
from people all the time, from you guys.
Do you plan to ever bring it back and work with it?
And broadly speaking, will you ever rework
any projects again?
Yeah, we're in the middle of reworking
the white cashmere.
Those packs?
Yeah, those, oh no, it was, yeah,
those packs coupled with the last like 30 to 50 seeds
we had, we went for broke.
Like we never pop everything,
but we popped everything this year.
So we got males in clone form, we saved all the females,
we got tons of pollen stocked up,
but it depends on how good the strain is.
You know, we would really be doing a lot of our clients
a disservice if we were to release,
do a re-release of the strain or to rework it.
It kind of takes away from the allure and the prestige
of why they bought it in the first fucking place.
Unless it was one of those strains where,
because a lot of the times in the first three years,
these strains didn't get saved.
They were literally grown as big ass outdoor plants
and the packs were moved back east.
I mean, that's just what's the culture in Humboldt
and Mendo at the time, you know?
So, you know, under certain circumstances like that,
like the white cashmere was one of those
where a lot of people really didn't save a cut.
It kind of disappeared.
And if we have enough evidence that it's disappeared,
we'll fucking, we'll do a re-release.
You know what I mean?
We'll do an encore release,
but we've never purposely opened up a strain
and then reworked it and released it.
Probably the only one we've done that with was like,
you know, the Royal Lions.
Cause every generation was different.
From like when I got it as the Royal Crest 7,
to we brought it in the 8 and 9,
every generation was fucking different.
Like now we have it at 12, you know,
we have it as like Magnum 12.
And so like, and it's completely different.
Every generation is just like, you know,
there's something unique in everything.
So when we go back and we open things up,
it's if only if we could find an entirely new direction,
then it becomes a new thing.
Yeah.
So that's actually a question
we got asked a lot about as well.
What was your journey with Mandelbrot's Royal?
And how did it go from being, you know,
the Royal 7, sorry, 6 to the Long Valley
to kind of where it is now?
So I met Mandelbrot through Kevin and Shiloh
at the Emerald Cup in 2013.
We won in 2012.
And then I got fourth place with the Royal.
And I remember on the card it said,
who's the breeder or who bred it?
I think there was this thing I was like,
I remember writing, I don't fucking know.
I wanted to know,
and cause I always heard about him.
I didn't know his name was Mandelbrot.
I always heard about the guy that bred the truth.
The guy that bred the Royal Kush.
Cause these are the strains that were going back East
and Dave Chappelle in common.
And most deaf were smoking on.
You know, the story on the street, you know,
when I heard it for Mandelbrot was,
that's how the strain got the name, the truth.
Is, you know, Chappelle was smoking some weed with,
you know, this is, you know, this is, you know,
this came from, you know, sitting in Mandelbrot's car.
It was like, you know, Dave Chappelle was smoking some weed
with fucking most deaf and Talib,
most deaf in common.
And I guess they called it,
it was sold to them as like Maui Superdog.
And someone got so high, I forgot who it was.
And he's like, no nigga,
that shit's called the truth, the truth.
And so that was like this whole story.
And, you know, that was the, you know,
and that was the story, you know,
motherfuckers were also talking about
when the truth seeds were in Mendo.
The truth seeds were the first fucking seeds I ever heard
that were $80 a seed.
Like they went for $80 a pack,
but my, our partner, Sean at the time,
who's no longer with us, bless your soul.
You know, he passed away from cancer.
He was one of the guys that came with the Mendo
when me and my first years.
He came into the fucking house
after going to a club in San Francisco.
And he was like, you want to fucking believe this?
Cause he was a seed collector too.
That was our thing.
We'd collect clones, we'd collect seeds.
We'd go to any club we could find clones of seeds
and just go shopping.
And he came back with these fucking truth seeds.
He was like, and he didn't pop them.
He was like, bro, I paid 80 bucks a seed for these.
I was like, bro, how many seeds are in there?
He's like 10.
He's like, it's like some of the best flower
you've ever smoked.
And he had some samples of flowers.
It was fucking crazy.
That was probably like 2010 when I saw those seeds.
And then fast forward to like 2013, when I won the cup,
I didn't know who had bred the Royal Kush.
So I didn't claim that I bred it.
So Mandelbrot, Shiloh comes up to the booth.
Kevin's also at the booth too.
And then Shiloh's with this fucking big dude.
And he was like, hey, this is Mandelbrot.
He bred the Royal Kush.
And I was like, holy fuck.
Because when I went to go find the seeds of the Royal Kush,
they were at this,
they were at Lovin' It at a dispensary in Mendocino.
And it was the only dispensary in the entire state
of California that had fucking Emerald Mountain seeds.
And they were all the original seeds.
They were all the original release seeds.
I remember buying tons of packs.
And we selected the winning Royal Sour out of that.
That's how the Royal Sour name came about.
It was a Fino from the Royal Kush seven packs
that was hella sour-y dominant.
It was long, long, lanky spaghetti noodle stems.
Anybody that grows Royal knows it's like a fucking pine tree.
It's short, stout, fat.
You know, it grows like a Christmas tree.
But this one was like a sour.
And so that was the one we entered.
And I remember the seeds were old
and they had really bad germ rates on them.
And then after I met Mandelbrot, he was like,
yeah, dude, those are the original seeds,
those original Royal Kush seven seeds I made.
I was like, holy fuck.
And so I remember after that, we became friends
and he sold me several hundred seeds of the truth,
the original truth, which some of them I still have,
and the Royals.
And so my goal was like, I was like, look, man,
I'm making this Royal and I wanna acclimatize it
to the Mendo environment.
You know, because what we were doing is, you know,
the Royal Kush was really unique
was you'd get a fucking nice, you know,
huge fucking crazy frosty plant that had gas,
but no powdery, no mold, you know.
And Laytonville's a really unique environment
as far as Mendocino's concerned.
It's not as dry as places like Boonville.
It's not as dry as places in, you know, East Willets,
like in Hearst.
You know, Laytonville definitely has
a lot more coastal influence, a little more fog.
So the whole goal of doing the Long Valley Royal Kush
was to select a Royal Kush from seed
that was relatively consistent.
If anybody remembers popping the original Royal Kush
seven seeds from broth,
every single pheno was crazy different.
Like not in a bad way, every pheno was fucking fire,
but you know, some would be long, some would be short,
some would be purple, some would have gas,
and so we wanted to get a strain
that I selected the sour D dominant male
and the sour D dominant female.
So because we felt that the sour D tendency,
sour D did really well in Laytonville.
It was old faithful.
You could grow a ton of it.
It wouldn't have a lot of powdery,
wouldn't have a lot of botrytis,
and you could get it to market.
So, you know, just from that observation,
I wanted to select, you know,
more of these smaller leaves, noodley branches.
Let's trace that, we're definitive to that.
And, you know, and then when I started working
his lines more, that when Mandelbrot sold me
those original seeds, that was, you know,
that was where we really made the fucking Royal Kush
and he helped me select.
And, you know, I was giving him plants up until,
you know, when he passed away, 2015, you know,
it was fucked up.
You know, I gave him, I actually gave him
the last of my plants in my greenhouse
because he had a problem on his farms,
a bunch of his plants died.
And I remember, you know, I was still with Lady L
at the time and Mandelbrot comes with his truck
and we just, we gave him like a few hundred
of our plants that we had left.
And it was all his genetics too.
So I was like happy to give it to him.
I was like, bro, you like, you know,
you helped me, you know, create these.
And I mean, not create these,
but you helped me like fucking grow these out
and select these fine, you know, what was fire.
You know, it was like the thing I could at least do
is give you these, you know?
So what was cool about Mandelbrot was he operated,
he vibrated at such a high fucking level, right?
Like he got me my first account at Ag Unlimited
and like, I'm still on his account.
It's like a Mac, I'm still on his account.
It's before I even knew his real name, I'd come in.
I'm like, yo, Mandelbrot here sent me.
It's like, who do you, Mac?
And I was kind of like, yeah, whatever.
That guy, big guy, you know, the guy I came in with.
And so he sent my first like real ag account up
at an ag wholesaler.
And at the time I was super into soil science.
I was super into compost.
I have just previously worked with Alan Atkinson
from Gokashi, who was doing Probiotic Farmers Alliance.
And so that was something that we really connected on.
Mandelbrot was doing Emerald Mountain Organics.
He was formulating soil for people.
He was actually mixing his own nutrients.
He was getting BioLink nutrients and he was mixing them
and having Ag Unlimited do custom mixes for him.
And then he would find his own inputs around.
So like really my regimen I gave to my plants.
It's like, I won the cup through the regimen I built with,
you know, that I learned from Mike and that I helped,
you know, it's like,
cause the cup soil recipe was jointly created
by Lady Elle and I, you know, her cousin Crazy Larry
had this crazy fire soil mix, we used that.
And then I was, you know,
I did all the top end fertilization and the gene selection.
But when it came to fertilizing,
that Mandelbrot had an incredible talent for that.
And that's where we really bonded on,
you know what I mean?
And I remember we would be at Area 101
with Emerald Cup Tim.
And at the time there was, I was there,
Mandelbrot was there.
I think Casey O'Neill might've been there.
But this guy named, this PhD plant pathologist
named Chuck Schiller, who invented the micronized 12-0-0,
the 12-0-0 soybean powder that a lot of people
are using as a foliar.
That's fucking crazy.
He invented that.
And, you know, he was kind of like him and Han,
a lot of his growers,
but he was genuinely blown the fuck away
by Mandelbrot's knowledge of soil sciences
and general botany and horticulture.
He was blown the fuck away, this guy's knowledge was.
So, you know, and I think that was probably
a year before he passed away,
was when, you know, they called us in,
you know, the whole thing,
Chuck Schiller was working for Grower's Secret at the time.
And Grower's Secret was like,
well, we're trying to formulate the best,
you know, bloom formula possible.
You know, and so like, you know,
me and Mandelbrot, we were really geeking out on that
because we had a beef with BioLynx, you know, phosphorus,
because their phosphorus was great.
They had this great phosphorus nutrient,
but it was a colloidal phosphate suspension.
So basically it was just fucking water
and soft rock phosphate, right?
So there was, you know, and so what we wanted
was we wanted something kind of like what BioCanna had,
but they had an exclusive license on it,
was like this colloidal phosphate-based
phosphorus bloom formula,
but that didn't have any sediment
that you could run through a drip line.
You know, because Mandelbrot was really big on,
all right, I want to breed these genetics,
but I also want to create the soil
and the nutrient, you know, nutrient regimen for it,
but I also want it to be scalable
and I want it to be universal so anybody can use it.
And so it's like, really working with Mandelbrot
goes way past the genetics.
The dude taught me so much about fucking general,
you know, general nutrients.
I still have a file box full of like the old catalogs
from Emerald Mountain Organics
of what the soil mixes Mandelbrot would make for people
and the different regimens.
Like he had a 32-part, no, an 18-part liquid,
organic liquid regimen,
and it wasn't for feeding the plant,
it was for feeding the soil.
Like he was on to some next-level shit.
Mandelbrot was the first person using a calcium,
magnesium, using a cow mag that was completely organic.
It was all from mined magnesium carbonate
and calcium carbonate.
And this company that was working with spinach farmers
back in the late 90s,
they found out that they could take this calcium carbonate
and this magnesium carbonate
and they could put in a vat
of what's called dextro-lactic acid.
And it's a different salt,
it's a different sugar-based,
or sugar, I think I'm saying the right thing,
sugar-based lactic acid.
But what it does is it attaches a sugar molecule
to the calcium and the magnesium components
in the magnesium calcium carbonate
and allows it to just hang out in the soil
as an amino acid-based calcium magnesium.
So what was crazy about this is whenever you generally
feed cow mag to a plant,
it's chelated with EDTA,
which is a chemical salt chelating agent,
and it gets directly absorbed by the roots.
But what Mandelbrot was doing, he was like,
fuck, how do I increase the mobile availability
of calcium and magnesium?
So we know that magnesium is mobile in soil,
but calcium isn't.
But through doing his fucking homework,
he was the first person to use cow mag DL on crops,
on like cannabis crops like this.
And that was like, when he taught me these things
and I switched to using his inputs,
man, my fucking soil went through the roof.
I remember the first time Dirty Business Soil came online
and I was actually able to see
what my cation exchange capacity is.
And what people don't understand,
they're listening what a cation exchange capacity is,
is basically a number that indicates the rate
of how available nutrients are in your soil
and the breakdown of nutrients in your soil.
So I was getting way higher numbers,
like with the soil that was using Mandelbrot's inputs
versus the soils that weren't.
So it's like, it goes way more than genetics.
How I grow completely changed because of him.
Yeah, for real as well, it's a lot to take in.
I'm trying to think about what the-
Yeah, because a lot of people don't know the story,
it was a really, it was something that,
it was street business back in the day.
So it was something that no matter what,
even though that there was drama
between Mandelbrot's brother and I back in the day,
it was something that, it wasn't my business to share.
Like it wasn't me, like people were doubting
that when I worked with Mandelbrot,
it wasn't up for me to reinforce that.
Like I knew what the fuck I did with Mandelbrot
and the right people to know what I did with Mandelbrot.
You know what I mean?
I was sitting with him in area 101,
helping formulate fucking bloom nutrients
with Chuck Schiller from Grower's Secret.
Chuck Schiller remembers that shit.
And so it's like, it was like a,
it was a bittersweet, you know,
because I had some drama with his family back,
you know, like two years ago.
And it was a really hard thing to deal with, you know,
because I had never met his family.
We had a strictly, it was old school relationship.
You know what I'm saying?
We were based on the hustle.
It's like, you know, people that usually
are fucking doing deals together,
you're not going to family barbecues together.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Unless you guys grew up together, you know,
and I'm a transplant, you know what I mean?
So I really didn't get to meet most of Mandelbrot's family
until I feel like he really passed away.
Yeah.
That's unfortunate to hear.
Yeah. He was like, he was probably, you know,
he's the whole point of working his lines,
especially after he passed away
was so his memory wouldn't die.
It was that a lot of people, you know,
me and Mandelbrot would talk about this thing
about the great breeders that would breed something
and their shit got raided by the cops or they got killed,
you know, and no one's ever going to hear that story.
And, and, and, and that shit's in those genetics
are forever going to be extinct, you know?
So it was about, you know,
I felt that this guy was like the father
of the contemporary, you know, of what,
he made breeding fuel possible for a larger,
for a larger audience that didn't have access
to things like chem dog or, or OG back cross seeds,
you know, and they get these kinds of crazy fuel profiles,
you know?
So I did, you know, it was like, I'd be damned
if, if, if, if all fuckers forgot about him,
you know what I mean?
But now his memory lives on through, you know,
numerous farms and Ben still can, you know,
Ben still continuing, you know, his brother's work.
And so like, that's the beautiful thing,
you know what I mean?
So.
Yeah, for sure.
So what type of legacy do you want to leave
on the industry from Aficionado?
I just want, I want to build something.
I want to build a company that's stand the test of time,
you know, and I think it's about, you know,
finding, finding different talents
that could help you take this vision
and take it somewhere, you know what I mean?
So like, you'd look at, like,
I studied a lot of fashion companies.
I grew up in, I grew up in, you know, Yokohama
and, you know, I studied fashion
when I was in college in Japan
before I, before I moved back to the States.
And so I've always been fascinated
by how a lot of these luxury companies were built,
a lot of how these fashion companies were built.
So you look at, you know,
long after Christian Dior passed away,
he had this guy named John Galliano, you know,
being his creative designer, you know?
And so you could have like, you know, after,
if the brand's good enough and it could live,
it could continue to live on,
it's still gonna need some sort of creative director
to carry that legacy.
I don't want to just sell a Fishin' Auto
and I want to do this for the rest of my life.
I want, I want, I want my grandkids
to be able to sit at the board of a Fishin' Auto's table
and work with whoever they choose
to be the creative director
or whoever's good enough to breathe,
you know what I mean?
So it's like with, you know,
Yves Saint Laurent, that's where I was how Tom Ford
was the creative director of Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci.
And all these companies were started by
a guy named fucking Yves Saint Laurent
and a guy whose last name was Gucci.
And so like my vision was like,
I mean, if we, if I could really,
if there's a possibility we could build something
that's stand the test of time,
that will still be here after we die,
what's needed to make that happen?
You know, so I guess we're exploring that right now.
And I know Frenchy's exploring that right now,
you know, cause Frenchy's building is a brand
that we want to stand the test of time too.
You know, Jack Daniels is gonna make the whiskey forever,
but he's gonna continue to stand the test of time.
And so it's really early in the industry
and it's gonna only time in the market
and consistency is gonna decide
who reaches that level first, you know?
Cause I don't think anyone's reached that level yet,
but I think it's worth trying.
Yeah, I totally agree.
So, I mean, if we're talking means to an end there,
what are you gonna release next?
What can people look forward to next?
And tell us what you're gonna have at Emerald.
So we're, so Emerald Cup,
our distributor seeds here now
is gonna be representing a Fish and Islet Cup.
I'll be doing some appearances there,
but due to regulation,
we weren't able to get all the right permits in time
for the Emerald Cup this year.
So James is gonna handle the launch for us.
We're also gonna be doing an online presale.
We've never done a launch online for the Emerald Cup.
It's always like people have always had to wait
after the Emerald Cup
for things to be available on seeds here now.
So what we're doing something different
is since our market has magically grown global
over the last two years,
we're gonna offer, you know,
special online pre-Emerald Cup release.
So people that are fans and have always supported us,
they could, you know, they have the opportunity to cop
what's gonna be at the Emerald Cup too.
Everybody has the opportunity to cop it now.
But there's not gonna be a lot.
You know, we did a 2000 plant sniff this year.
We worked a lot of strains that we worked last year.
We ended up only keeping 80 plants out of the 2000.
And we only pollinated 13, 13 plants.
Different, we used some different males
on some different plants,
but our production, like that's what we made.
And so five, five to five of those 13,
we'll probably make it.
The fruit tartar turned out really good.
In the pines, cross forbidden fruit magnum opus,
that turned out hella good.
We're releasing that.
We released six boxes of the F1 of Formula One.
And those auctioned for obscene amounts of money.
We never thought they would auction for so much.
I guess the fact that there was only six boxes,
we used some good shit on them too.
It went for a huge price,
but we wanted people, we liked it so much.
We was like, man, there just can't be six people
in fucking boxes of Formula One.
So we're gonna release the F2.
And we were pretty happy with how the F2,
how the F2 is turning out.
And we're really excited with how the F1
turned out in general.
So we have the Sichuan flambe,
which is the sangria times cherry noire times testa rosa.
That's the one that we're really excited about.
And we have a few that still waiting to be named.
We just can't find the perfect name for them.
But we're gonna be releasing an OG cross this year.
I did a collab with the guy who brought me up to Mando.
His name is Mendocino Mike.
And we bred his, he has this OG called,
we call it the Green Bomb OG.
His name is Mike Green Bomb.
So we call it the Green Bomb OG.
And what that is, it's heirloom bubblegum
crossed with an SFV OG that he had from Seed
that he's been making himself for the last four years.
And so he crossed that with the old school bubblegum.
And he got this bubblegum framed plant that turns purple,
but still somewhat smells like OG.
It's weird.
It's like you get this fruity bubblegum,
but there's just as much OG on the contrast in the bud.
It's fucking crazy.
And so we crossed that with our Versailles OG,
which was like a really good solid OG.
And we're releasing that year.
And we're calling that,
that's gonna be, we're releasing the Miyazaki OG.
And that's what we're calling that.
And that's from my old Japan roots.
Miyazaki was a director who created films such as Totoro.
And we always called Mike Totoro
cause he was like a mountain spirit.
He's like a forest spirit.
He's like this guy's, he's like a late fifties,
huge white beard, tatted from head to toe,
walks barefoot.
He's a fucking mountain spirit.
This guy's a forest spirit.
So, and he taught me a lot about paying respect to plants
and appreciating nature the way that Miyazaki's films
did for me when I was growing up as a kid in Japan.
So we chose to name that, that's straight Miyazaki OG.
And the next two, we just haven't named yet,
but they're good.
They're good.
We came across a flavor
and the Backyard and BCN got some of these seeds.
Leo got some of these seeds
and it's working title was Rosso Corsa.
And that was this offshoot from the Testarossa line
we were working when we crossed it with the Cherry Noir
and Rosso Corsa is the name.
We weren't gonna brand it this way
because that's Ferrari has that name trademarked
as the color of the paint on their cars.
So it was just like, I just called it that
just as remember that it was like,
that's obviously from my Testarossa cross.
You know what I mean?
Because the number, the color red on the Testarossa
was called Rosso Corsa.
But we're going through this thing
where we're trying to find a good identity for it
because it doesn't smell like anything
we've ever worked before.
It's got a completely, it literally smells like,
like if you were trick or treating
and you had a roll of Smarties in your pocket get crushed up
and then somehow someone spilled gasoline.
You know what I mean?
It's insane, like crazy.
We've never been able,
we never thought we'd be able to get Terps
like this to express.
So we wanted something that we could call it
that would give it its justice
and two, we wouldn't get a cease and desist from Ferrari.
Sounds exciting.
Yeah, because Testarossa is like, you know,
Italian for redhead.
And so like a lot of the stems and the leaves
in the Testarossa would get this red hue
and that's why, you know, we call it the Testarossa
and the Rossa Corsa was even more fucking red.
It was just this brilliant, vibrant red
that would transition to a lavender
and then like a Royal purple.
And then, but the nose was just pure candy shop,
pure candy shop.
Maybe we'll call it candy shop.
It sounds really exciting.
I got a question though for you
and you gotta be honest here.
When you do the online launch,
do you expect the site to crash?
Fuck, that would be cool.
I mean, the coolest thing that happened to Seeds here now
is we crashed their servers one time
where the orders came in so fast,
they actually oversold.
And because the computers couldn't keep up with them
with the frequency of orders going out.
So that was like, you know,
we never expect these kinds of things to happen.
It's just, we're really grateful and we're humbled,
you know, because we really approached this like as music,
we could, you know, if we're in the garden,
you know, our version of a studio,
there's a really good chance what we make won't connect.
So it's like, if it connects on the front end
and people like the cross and they like the way it sounds,
and then it really expresses itself
to exceed their expectations,
then that's when we'll know, you know, our job was done.
So it's like, it's really hard for us
to get excited over sales
because the sales is the first part of that relationship
with the grower, you know,
who's the cornerstone of your fucking brand.
You have to get his validation.
It's not a good day.
It's not a good day when you sell the seeds.
It's a scary day when you sell the seeds
because you better fucking hope those seeds
come out good for that grower.
So when you get the feedback months later,
that's when you know you could rest easy.
Because your testing could be on point.
In your friend's gardens that you're testing
other strains too,
we tested our other strains in Mendo this year
and they did good as usual
because Mendo's where we're from.
We know it's gonna test good,
but is it gonna hold up in other people's growths?
It's gonna express yourselves according to your expectations
and their expectations in their environment.
So that's the key.
So I try not to get too excited about it.
You know, I think if you get excited about selling seeds,
you're in it for the wrong purpose.
And that, you know, if you're getting excited too early
and then, you know,
you just can't forecast the fucking future.
You know what I mean?
If we could all forecast the future,
we wouldn't be in the weed game,
we'd be running headphones.
So, I guess that's the fact.
All the testing in the world could be good,
but if it doesn't prove itself on the market, you're fucked.
So bringing us to kind of the tail end of things,
a really interesting question I pose to a lot of people.
It doesn't seem to be a very clear answer.
What's your recommendations for the small scale farmers,
both indoor and out,
who are kind of continually dealing with this conundrum
of ever decreasing prices and ever increasing supply?
That's a really difficult problem, isn't it?
Yeah, I think the regulations are changing almost daily.
Right when people adapt to a certain set of circumstances,
the circumstances change yet again.
I'm a long-term thinker.
I know it's really painful for a lot of people
that are in the rec industry.
It's not as profitable as it used to be.
You gotta pay every fucking tax under the moon.
Things are getting spread out.
Regulation makes it so, definitely, like I said before,
we're not making as much money.
So, speaking in light of a long-term scale,
if they could just hold on,
hold on for another two to four years, man.
Keep grinding as hard as you fucking can
for two to four years,
because Canada's already made cannabis international.
And the amount of fucking money that government,
cannabis is gonna dramatically improve Canada's GDP.
It's huge.
And America's not gonna sit back
and watch this happen for too much longer.
A lot of people agree with the sentiment in Washington.
And I still talk to a lot of my old colleagues
back in Washington that are still doing it.
I'm like, hey, what's hot right now?
Where do you think politics are going?
You know?
And then I'll kind of get a feel for things.
I think that whether you wanna fucking acknowledge it
or not, cannabis is international right now.
So people, these small farmers have to embrace the future
and just hold the fuck on.
Because once this goes international,
these small farms are overnight gonna be big,
or are gonna be the next big Napa wineries.
All their products are gonna fucking sell out
over and over and over and over.
Smart ones are gonna fuck a scale immediately.
And then they're gonna, you know,
California right now,
California weed is all over the fucking planet.
If you go on Instagram,
you go on different feeds in the UK,
you go on different feeds in Spain.
Just the fact of the matter is,
there's California branded weed everywhere.
And it's going for a premium.
And that's, you know,
so a lot of people have to understand,
when we were breeding,
we like to read what the black market's doing
and see what trends in the black market are doing.
That's one of the most demanding markets
as far as taste and flavor,
when you're just dealing with people
that buy things at the highest ticket possible.
And so it's like what the black market's doing,
you know, worldwide,
you're seeing a lot of, you know,
somehow a lot of these packs from Cali
are going worldwide,
but they're going for huge premiums.
And that should be indicated to everybody
that when this fucking switch flips guys,
when this switch flips,
everyone's gonna have it made.
That sacrificed everything,
that put their fucking dick on the line,
you know, put everything on the line,
their families, their wellbeing,
to just keep doing this dream of cannabis.
We gotta stop looking at just the Cali thing,
even though it's the Cali thing for right now,
cause it's not always gonna be like that.
The world's global,
the market dynamics are gonna change big time.
But one thing we know that's not gonna change
is that consistently the best quality
is gonna continue to come out of California, hands down.
It's just our culture,
what we're known for.
That's it, right?
Yep, so it's like telling me,
you're at the top, it's hard right now,
it's hard to look at it.
Just hold on guys,
I believe in everybody, man.
It's like, our shit was so fire for years,
it was going back east for a long time,
you know what I mean?
And who else knows where it was going?
But what's we know right now?
If you just surf on Instagram a little hard,
you see Caliweed in different places in Europe,
it happens.
They have a whole import category at clubs in Amsterdam.
Import weed, get the fuck out of here, really?
I was like, come on guys,
that's the highest price point.
So it's like, people need to start accepting
that our fate as California for the large part,
if you're raw at your fucking game,
man, it's gonna be like wine.
Or your shit's gonna go for extremely high premiums,
one, because your location,
and two, because you got roots in the game
and you're able to back that up with your quality.
So it's like, if you got a farm
and you're holding on right now,
just keep fucking holding on guys,
because you're gonna do way better.
You guys are gonna be the magic makers
that connect with everybody.
Breeders can only connect with so many people,
but growers connect with everybody.
Those are the true artists.
So what do you think is the best way
to deal with the dichotomy of needing to use Instagram
or social media in general as a breeder
to promote your brand,
but also trying to stay off it?
It's fucking necessary.
I think if anybody doesn't think it's necessary,
you're crazy.
Your shit better be so fucking fire,
other people just naturally post pictures of it.
You know what I mean?
I think the world's changed.
How we interface with people has changed.
Before it was on threads and it was on forums,
it was on ICMag, it was on the hustle,
but now Instagram's changed the game.
We're so more connected than we've ever been.
People are able to show their grow methods.
We've seen a huge exponential increase in raw growers.
You know, motherfuckers are put,
people, a lot of people, a lot of hobbyist growers,
people just starting out, people just into Instagram
are growing some good shit
because they're watching all these pros on Instagram,
sharing their knowledge, man, sharing the tech.
And so like, you know, quality's continuing to go up.
And that's because of the phenomenon of Instagram.
And more people globally have been able
to discover Aficionado through IG
than we ever have been being in magazines,
being in Skunk and being in High Times.
I mean, being in High Times is big for us,
but consistently when you have a platform
that reaches everybody in the world
and everyone network overlaps to these worldwide networks,
it creates a reach that we never been able to see before.
So it's like, I think everyone's still adjusting
to this new culture of IG.
It's absolutely necessary.
And it's fucked up when people get their accounts deleted
because their livelihoods, their followings
are dependent on their IG.
And unfortunately, a lot of people's success
is measured upon their followers
because people think there's a corollary
between your followers and your consistency
as being someone who's a supplier of quality.
So, but perception's reality
and this is how people communicate.
So we can't ignore reality.
We gotta be real.
Yeah.
Right now it's on Instagram, it goes down to DM.
All righty, so just onto the final
little last few questions.
These are the more short response ones, generally speaking.
First one, it's a bit of a lesser ass one,
but I have a feeling you have a good answer.
What's your favorite Tom Hill strain besides deep chunk?
It was deep chunk.
I know, but that's why I said the size.
It was deep chunk because I heard stories about him
on Spirog having the balls to select their 3000 plants.
Like nobody was doing that when Tom Hill was doing that.
Fucking nobody.
And so the fact that he was able to get the old blue Hindu
and the old red Hindu,
and people in town, Laytonville,
can actually trace back,
who the fuck brought the Hindu back to Laytonville?
And it's not my business to make
who these people are public knowledge,
but definitely Jackson knows these people,
Dminji knows these people 100%.
And these are the people that originally brought Hindu Kush
back to Spirog in the 70s.
And so when Tom Hill was working it,
what in the 90s, early 2000s,
nobody was doing that.
Nobody was putting their balls in the line
and select it like that.
So it was just the whole mystique of him having,
him being so devoted to his craft,
he's willing to blow it up that much,
not to sell the flower, but to select a fucking seed.
Oh, he was crazy back in the day to not use that shit
and to sell all that flower.
And he was selecting for like the best possible shit.
Like that's passion.
And so it's like for that one,
like he went through that sacrifice to make deep chunk,
that's my backup why deep chunks my favorite of his.
It was the folklore behind that too,
that really attracted me.
Yeah, no, it's a good story.
And it is a fan favorite.
So next one, what strain do you wish you had back?
Oh, fuck.
Which one did I fucking get rid of?
Which one have I lost?
I lost my original G13 cross.
That got lost in a raid.
It was at a buddy's place.
It was a G13 across Panama.
It wasn't anything that was super special.
It was something that was special to me in the terms that
it, one, it harvested late as fuck.
You know, it harvested like second week in November,
but it didn't get any mold.
And it had the craziest high, the craziest high.
But the one I really regret losing is the,
really the bulk of my white cashmere seeds.
I think that was one of the strains that I really could have
opened up a lot more.
I really could have explored that one a lot more.
And, you know, there's a few others that I've let kind of go
out of the window that I'm like, fuck,
I shouldn't have sold all those, you know?
Cause it was to me, I want, if I want it to me,
it was a personal thing that if I really felt my work was
good enough, I'd let it all go.
You know, I'd say like a little bit,
but I wanted to see really where I stood, you know,
would it come back to me?
Would people keep working it?
And if people didn't work it, then obviously it wasn't,
it didn't meet my expectations for what could be a classic,
you know, cause it,
cause people weren't inclined to keep working it.
And so it was things like that where I released really small
numbers of it.
People didn't work it because I felt like I could have done
better at the breeding.
Yeah. You know?
Okay.
So what is the most memorable or the best strain you've ever
smoked?
Big Sur, Holyweed.
2012,
we were at the cannabis cup in Richmond.
I was with Frenchie.
It was the first cup I met Bam,
when Bam was still working with Coastal Seeds.
And I met Mike from Coastal Seeds.
And I had always read about the Big Sur Holyweed.
And I was like dying to try it.
I was almost a Teva guy.
And I was dabbing all day.
It was like when dabs and shatter came out,
it was 2012, you know,
cannabis cup and we were,
we were getting fucked up, man.
We were dabbing like crazy.
I didn't think I'd get any higher.
Mike pulls out this joint.
I meet Mike from Coastal Seeds through our friend,
Johnny Q and who Johnny Q runs Stanky Dank.
He's also an Emerald Cup winner from 2011, 2010.
And, and fucking he,
we light this Big Sur Holyweed
and it cuts clear through all the dabs.
Like it was almost like the C5 haze.
Like the closest thing to C5 haze for me,
as far as like intensity of cerebral high
was Mike's Big Sur Holyweed.
That shit was fucking crazy.
It was like, it cut through all those dabs.
We were smoking OG, you know,
Bamf was big at the time.
We were smoking a lot of his fucking Lemon OG hash,
which was really strong.
You know, I had a kick.
Man, but that fucking Big Sur Holyweed,
that was probably easily the most,
that and, and this too, this too.
When I won the cup in 2012,
Derek Emerald gave me some flowers of his in the pines
and Derek Emerald had won five Emerald Cups previous,
you know, to me winning.
And to me, I think he's probably one of the absolute,
but he's, in my opinion,
the absolute best grower to ever compete
in the Emerald Cup circus, Derek Emerald.
And when I smoked his flowers,
I think, you know, on point with how blown away I was
with Mike's flowers,
that was really memorable as far as like,
holy fuck, that's Big Sur Holyweed.
It's exceeded all expectations.
That's incredible.
But Derek Emerald's flowers in the pines
he gave me that year
was the absolute best flower I've ever fucking smoked.
You could taste, taste the fucking love
that he put into it, you know?
And then I think also the first time I met,
I met Mean Gene.
It was the first time I met Mean Gene
was at the Peg House in Leggett.
And I meet him online.
He's telling me he has some crazy shit.
And he says, hey, come out to this reggae show.
I'm gonna be a performer.
And I'm like, fuck you, you do reggae?
That's cool.
Sounds cool.
So I'm like out there.
I haven't met him yet.
I'm waiting to meet Jackson at the Peg House.
And we see our homie.
He's like this, you know,
he's this OG guy everybody from the neighborhood knows.
And I say, what's up, man?
Here's my weed.
Check out my weed, you know?
I show him this weed of this bud of something
we selected from the can of tonic
that we called La Dolce Vita.
It was like this 27% THC can of tonic.
It was fucking crazy.
And then I smell what homie's smoking on,
what Rick was smoking on.
And it was like the craziest fucking flavor
I've ever smelled.
And I'm like, what the fuck are you smoking?
He goes, cherry, cherry, cherry crossed lime,
cherry pie crossed lime.
And I'm like, who grew that?
He was like, my boy.
He wouldn't tell me who grew it, you know?
He was like, my boy.
And then, you know, I remember Jackson,
you know, Gene goes on stage.
He does his thing, kills it.
You know, he's a really good performer
if you ever heard his music.
But he gets off stage and I'm like, bro,
you gotta fucking try this weed, bro.
He was like, and then Rick's like, oh, that's my boy.
He's the one who made it.
And I was like, you know, it was like, bro,
you know, if you would have entered that this year,
you would have fucking beat me like hardcore.
Like it would have been last line.
He was like, nah, he was really humble about it.
Like, nah, your fucking shit would have won, bro,
if you entered this.
And he ended up fucking getting a breeder's cup
of cherry lime, like a few years later.
You know what I mean?
And it was like, that was like,
so those three experiences, Derek Emerald,
Mike from Coastal, and then the first time I met me,
Gene, in 2012 at the Peg House.
That was like the most memorable pod experiences I had.
Oh, and then one more, I have to share one more,
one more, cause it's good.
The first day I get to Mendo, I'm at Mountain Mike's house.
And we had, we're fresh from San Diego.
We had just closed the club down.
The sheriff's had shut the club down.
But Mike had some weed that was hanging in the house
for like literally six fucking months.
Like the whole time he was like,
he was Mike, when I was running the club in San Diego
with Mike, he was back and forth,
you know, going from Mendo to San Diego all the time.
And so like, when we finally had the club shut down,
we were there, he had this weed
that was hanging there for six months.
And it was original Urkel.
And it was the first time I had the realist Urkel.
And that was, that was probably some of the highest,
probably the, some of the happiest high weed
I've ever smoked in my life was that original Urkel
that Mike had just sitting there
after months and months and months and months.
I never tasted a flavor like that, you know.
His house was like in the trees.
And so it was in this place in the stairs
where his house was wood and there was like a perfect,
it was always cool and cold
and there was always the right temperature.
So it just cured perfectly after these last six months.
But you know, that was like, it was my first time in Mendo
and my first time smoking Mendo weed was like,
you know, that Urkel.
So I guess, you know, those four experiences
were like definitive to me,
which changed how I looked at weed
and how I approached that weed.
Every single one of those experiences
pushed me to want to get to that level.
I was like, wow, that level exists?
What do I have to do to just get on that level?
What kind of concentration do I need to have?
What discipline do I need to have to express myself
in the way these guys are expressing themselves?
You know, it came like that for me.
Yeah, what an awesome little backstory.
So onto our third last question.
Polar opposite of the best one,
what's the worst weed strain?
Berry white.
I fucking hate berry white.
It's a great plant to grow, but it's just frosty.
It's got no kick.
The hash sucks.
Nobody wants to smoke it.
I mean, that was definitely one strain
that I wasn't really a fan of.
I'm a big fan of weed.
So it's like there's one strain I hate growing,
I hate growing Bubba, but I love smoking that one.
But there's one thing I just hate smoking,
it's fucking, you know, some people say Blue Dream,
Trainwreck, I like smoking all that shit.
You know what I mean?
When it's for some reason, I do not.
Berry white, yeah.
I'll always have a little soft spot for Blue Dream,
I reckon.
Onto the next question.
So desert island, top three weeds
or you can smoke for the rest of your life.
What are you gonna do?
Oh, that's a good one.
That's a good one.
Damn, he got me on that one.
Okay, okay, I got you, I got you.
Original, it's really hard to find the original sour D.
Everybody says they have it, but it's not the real sour D.
Even when I was moving packs,
120 pounds was the real sour D.
Any hustler agree with that?
They're like, yeah, motherfucker's right.
He's probably being nice too.
But if I could find the, you know, the original,
just like that fucking crazy sour from back in the day
that would just stink up your whole car,
I'd bring that with me.
I definitely bring Chemdog.
Yeah, Chemdog, sour and C5 haze.
Nice little array.
Yeah.
Yeah, awesome.
Okay, and so lucky last question.
If you could go back in time to anywhere, any place
to get some land race seeds, presumably,
where would you go?
Oh man.
I don't know, like Marco Polo times in like Southeast Asia.
Like, you know, before like Western expansion,
you know, cause with trade,
he also saw the trade of certain cultivars of plants
that were being domesticated by people throughout,
you know, Europe and Asia.
So, you know, I always heard these stories about,
you know, my favorite weed just generally,
since I was in Thailand as a young kid,
it was always been the Thai and the Burmese weed.
And I always wondered what weed was like
from those villages.
Cause they purposely cultivated those flowers
in certain parts of those areas just for their flower,
just for smoking it.
You know, whereas other places in the region,
in the world, like, you know, like India and Pakistan
and Afghanistan, there's hash cultures
and other places that were cultivating hemp
were cultivating it for fiber.
But, you know, Southeast Asia was one of those rare places
where people, you know, and some parts of Africa too.
I won't forget about that.
But, you know, fuck Thailand, Burma, 1800s before Western,
real, real Western industrial, you know,
technocratic expansion happened where people,
where their ancient way of life wasn't allowed anymore.
You know, so I wanted to, you might, you know,
if I had it, if I get a time machine,
what was, what, what, if they were one of the only cultures
on the fucking planet, you know,
breeding weed and selecting it for the taste
and the high of the flower, man,
what the fuck were they smoking on before, you know,
Western, for Western ideals says that this isn't good
for you and we have to outlaw that.
Or even before when, you know, you know,
different dramatic changes happen in certain countries
where that culture is lost because of the villages
and it's obliterated due to war.
You know, that's also a factor too.
So yeah, I've got to, I got to think for those hazes
from Southeast Asia.
Totally.
Alrighty, so I think that might bring us
to just about the end of it.
Did you have any comments or shout outs you wanted to make?
