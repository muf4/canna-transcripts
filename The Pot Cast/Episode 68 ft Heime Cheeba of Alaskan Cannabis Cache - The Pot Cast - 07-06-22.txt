On this episode, we're joined by our second friend from the final frontier, Jaime Chiba,
the man behind Alaskan cannabis seed cache, a seed preserver and historian in his own right.
He's come on the show today to tell us about some of his breedings, some plans for the
future, and talk about some RKS.
So without further ado, let's get into it.
All right, friends, we're back for another one.
And on this episode, we're joined by the old school head and founder of Alaskan Cannabis
Cache, Jaime Chiba.
Thank you so much for joining us today.
You're welcome.
Thanks for having me.
As always, I'd love to start the show by asking our guests, what have you been smoking on
recently?
Well, we've got a local strain here called Mud Bite Delight, and it's pretty much a staple
for me.
So I kind of stick with that.
It's an old school strain originally developed in the early 60s by a chemist, believe it
or not, who brought it back from South Africa.
Wow.
That's actually one of the strains I was going to ask you about, not just because it's sort
of in your repertoire, but I'd actually dug up some posts on various forums where people
were like, you know, talking about how much they enjoyed it.
Does that mean that it's sort of South African genetics is what it's made up of?
Yes, totally.
Back then, everything was in seed.
There was no clones or anything.
So pretty much the seeds in someone's pocket is what ended up being some of the stuff that
was grown here in Alaska and California.
Yeah.
Wow.
And so would you describe that as sort of like a more uplifting effect?
And what's the flavors on it?
You know, it's got a really heavy, ripe strawberry terp to it.
Real heavy.
Anise.
Anise is another one.
So, you know, kind of leads me to think that there might be a few more strains in there
than I thought.
It might be a wild hybrid, so to speak.
A lot of that was going on.
And it was Rhodesia at the time.
So, yeah, it's hard to say because the breeder, the original breeder, I never met him.
I met the people that inherited the strain and then I just kept it going.
My first job as a pot grower was to pack water for Mud Bite Delight.
That's really interesting.
And I mean, you know, you referenced the anise flavor in there, and that's one that
commonly gets thrown around as like the typical description for a dirty,
the typical description for a Durban.
Do you see some overlap there?
Yeah, it has, you know, I want to say it has Durban in it, most definitely.
And then some heavy Afghani presence in there also.
But it's a great daytime smoke.
Keeps you motivated doing things, but it's got a good stone.
So if you got eggs and pans and you're old like I am, it helps.
Helps a lot.
That's awesome to hear.
I had noticed while scrolling through your Instagram that obviously a wide variety
of different strains, but a lot of them sort of fell under the general umbrella
of Afghani.
And I was sort of wondering, are you like me in that you would say sort of
generally speaking, you're a fan of the Afghanis?
I am, but I'm also a fan of sativas.
I'm a, you know, you say breeder.
I'm more of a preservationist.
That's what I call myself.
You know, some people have called me the crazy seed collector.
A lot of people came to my home over the years, and the few people that I showed
what I had going on thought I was, you know, insane for just growing weed
with seeds in it and preserving strains instead of selling weed.
You know, that was the thing, and that's what everybody did during my era.
So, you know, kind of this is validation to an old crazy guy after all these
years of having seeded plants and trying to explain it to good friends and
people that I meet in the industry over the years.
It's a little bit different now.
You know, as far as the breeding goes, I took what came to me and I crossed it,
but I did a lot of work.
So, it's the work that you put in that makes you a breeder, and the testing,
and sending it out there, and getting results from other people.
That, in that sense, I think makes you a breeder.
I call myself a breeder only because I do that.
I have everything tested by other people and I accept whatever they have to say
about whatever I put out there, and I'll either release something or I won't
depending on what they give me, what their feedback is.
Yeah, wow. It's funny because, like, as you were saying that,
in my mind I'm like ticking these boxes.
I'm like, yep, that checks out, that checks out, that checks out.
And then at the end of it, I'm like, wait, you just described, like,
what a good breeder is, really.
It's, you know, like I said before, my currency is time.
It's not money.
Everything I do, just to bring something to an F5, will take me six to seven years.
You know, and I've worked with a lot of different strains and brought them
up to that point, but I haven't released a lot because it's been so much work
to just set it out there and have somebody grab it up and call it something else.
It kind of would break my heart.
It's kind of a collector thing, I guess, or part of my mental illness
of collecting seeds and working with strains for over these years,
not giving them away.
You might call me a hoarder.
A lot of people call me a hoarder when I wouldn't release a roadkill skunk.
And that's basically what prompted me to release it,
that being called greedy and selfish.
None of those things.
It was just that I could have released a stable version or an IBL.
And I thought, you know, the IBL, that would release the whole genome
to everybody so they can work with it and find what they want in there.
And there's been a myriad of things, but there is no floral accents
like a lot of people are finding in some skunks.
The roadkill originally had none of that.
That's what it was originally called.
It was originally called roadkill, not roadkill skunk.
That came about in the late 80s, early 90s.
People started calling it RKS and roadkill skunk
when I started selling clones.
Yeah, wow.
A lot of notable points to touch on in that one.
We'll have to loop back to a few of them.
Before we jump into the roadkill skunk stuff,
I just wanted to quickly ask, in the prior question you referenced,
you were hanging on to all these seeds all through the 80s and 90s.
I'm wondering, did you have the foresight back then
to know that at some point in the future these seeds would be valuable
or was it more different and it was just like,
I just want to retain my own seeds really?
That's how it started out.
Then in my travels, I traveled extensively.
I met a few people that were doing the same thing as me,
but they seemed as crazy as I was and got the same feedback.
What really spurred me on and the part that most people
don't understand because it was illegal,
there was a lot of people that would lose their strains
because a girlfriend would turn them in or they were stupid
or they let somebody in or they just plain got busted,
door got kicked in and they lost their strain.
I started to think, well, if I'm going to keep doing this
to collect more and to get more, I can guarantee people
that have a saleable product that they're making money on
out there selling every day bags to the public.
If I take their strain and I save it,
then I have those genetics that they want to start over.
I have those in seed form.
Sometimes it was clones, but I prefer not to work with clones.
I'm trying to keep them alive over a long period of time.
I've kept some clones alive longer than I ever should have,
but that's a lot more work than breeding
or working with seed stock.
The toughest thing for me was the retention of males,
trying to keep...
I have a pretty extensive seed stock and trying to keep
all these things alive, I regenerate them every three years.
So every three years, I'll regrow as much as I can
in a rotating basis so nothing gets older than three years
and doesn't lose its viability for germination.
A lot of people don't do that, but that's the only way
if you're going to make sure that somebody gets the product
that they want or they were working with before,
that they have a reasonable experience in growing it out,
germinating it, and getting what they had before.
Yeah, certainly.
I think what you just referenced there with strains being lost
is a plight felt by most breeders.
I think most people who have come on the show can talk
of a few strains they've regrettably lost over the years
that they wish they still had.
I wanted to quickly ask though, you mentioned breeding things
over multiple generations, and I'd be interested to know
from your perspective, let's use the roadkill skunk,
for example, because I'm sure we'll talk about it a bunch
throughout the episode.
I think you've covered the F5 or maybe even a little further
at the moment.
What have you noticed change over the generations
as you've worked with it?
Have you been able to narrow things a bit,
or are you trying to open it up?
I'm trying to open it up.
What I find has really happened with it is it's lost
its heavy stone effect.
It's more of a happier stone.
A lot of people are enjoying it.
It does have that old school effect, but it doesn't have
the original heavy stone when I first sourced it.
When I sourced it in Albion area of Mendocino
from some old hippie couple and their commune-like people
that was growing outdoors in that region.
In California, they had what are called planting holes.
You dig a hole in this clay soil, this dense clay soil,
and then you'd add soil or amended soil to that
that you made your own soil.
You grow your plants in that.
In that region, there's a pH problem or alkalinity problem
that stunts the trees and natural growth of the bushes
and plants around there.
One of the things I recommend to people with roadkill
is that you adjust your pH downwards to bring out
the heavier scent.
I noticed the further you get away with your pH,
the higher you go with it, the less it stanks.
Wow, that's really interesting.
It makes sense using the known terroir effect.
I'd be interested to know, have you ever feel around
with adding or subtracting sulfur from the soil
and seeing because a lot of people always throw out
the idea like roadkill skunk maybe has like some thiol,
some sulfur type compounds in it.
Do you have any thoughts on that?
A lot of people use sulfur up here.
We really don't have issues where it requires sulfur.
I never experimented too much with sulfur at all,
but I have heard that.
I have heard about the thiols.
Without having DNA testing or genetic testing on things,
it's hard to say exactly what's in there that creates
the stench, but the plant, when it was growing in its prime,
the place that I sourced it from was up river,
about three quarters of a mile.
You could actually smell part of the grow from Highway 1
on the coast.
You had ocean air blowing in, but you could still down river
smell the smell of that grow, that particular grow.
It was one of the first ones on the river.
Wow.
Do you think that the reason why we don't see it anymore
is because, as people say, people just got busted with it?
That's the reason I stopped making clones available.
There were just too many people getting busted.
Really good people that I know really well.
I don't know if you had it going on over there in Australia,
but they were taking everything you had under federal
forfeiture laws, and police departments were getting rich.
Good folks, the only thing that they were doing was
selling marijuana for a living.
They were getting busted and losing everything they had,
sometimes their children.
Those stories, they're too horrible to listen to
for a plant that you had a part in making sure
it got distributed widely.
I think its downfall really was that it's a medium yielder
at best.
When Big Bud came in, BC Big Bud, it kind of stole the show.
That and the widows and the whites kind of stole the show
as a commercial grow, so to speak.
A lot of what I did, as far as unknown strands,
a lot of people say, well, what's the name of that?
Well, sometimes I've got a strand that's just called
Bob's Strands, but it's completely a knockout strand.
I don't know the background of the strand,
because when I got it from Bob, he didn't know.
It might have been bag seed.
He doesn't know its origins, but it made him a lot of money.
So I preserved it, and then when, especially around here
where people got used to smoking it for years,
I would let it back out, and they're like,
oh, yeah, what's the genetics on this?
I'm like, your guess is as good as mine.
So on that end, like I say, being a preservationist
and a breeder are two separate things.
If I'm preserving something, I want to preserve something
as close to the original as possible,
especially in those instances in seed form
so I can get that person that lost everything
up and running again.
Yeah, that's a very sort of noble cause.
I can definitely jive with that.
And I mean, while we're on the topic of talking
about the genetics in a strain, one of the tales you hear
about the roadkill skunk, and I think you'd be
the perfect person to ask, that it sort of originally
had its roots in like the bikey scene.
Do you believe there's any truth to that,
given you just said you actually got it
from a hippie community?
Well, to be honest with you, I used to go
to Garberville, California to the Redwood Run.
I am a biker.
And when I go to Garberville to the Redwood Run
that have all these different rock and roll shows,
I also hooked up with a lot of regional Humboldt area breeders.
And I just came across this hippie couple
that came up to see one of the shows.
And they offered to show me their grow
and hooked me up with some stuff I could bring back
to Alaska to share with everybody here.
It was one of the things I did when traveling.
I smuggled a lot of weed.
Hawaii, California, Kentucky, Tennessee.
So yeah, a lot of it, you know, I'd bring it back here
and friends would go ahead and get rid of it for me
because I didn't sell weed.
The problem with me selling weed is if I got busted,
I didn't just lose my seed stock.
I lost everybody's seed stock.
So I tried to be as careful as I could
with what I was entrusted with.
I mean, some of those people are gone today
and I ask their relatives to this day,
can I go ahead and reuse this strain?
This used to be your uncle's or your father's
or your grandfather's.
Can I reintroduce this?
You have a problem with that?
And almost none of them have.
I did notice in California,
there was really no interest in seeds
when I tried to reintroduce them.
Years ago, I went to the Redwood Run
for almost 40 years and tried to reintroduce
some of the seed stock or just give them back.
Here's these genetics.
I got these from your grandpa, your father,
aunt, uncle, etc.
And they just weren't interested.
They say, hey, dude,
we do everything from established clones here.
We know what works here.
And I'm like, okay, I'm just telling you,
I got the seed stock from your folks
and I've kept it all these years.
If you want it, it's yours.
And they're like, nah, hang on to it, it's yours.
Wow.
I think there's probably a lot of people
who are like wishing they could have traded places.
Like, you know, kudos to you
for restraining yourself in that conversation
and just being able to be like, well,
you don't know what you don't know.
Yeah.
You know, it's sad because there is a lot of stuff
that got lost because I can only collect so much myself.
You know, I know what I liked and what my friends liked.
You know, we all have our group
that we have our sessions with
that we enjoy cannabis with.
And then we have another extension of people
that we give pot to or share with
because they have ailments or certain things going on.
And to lose some of those things
that have been out there for years,
I think was, you know, the biggest crime
that was committed during the whole pot prohibition
was losing all those things
that could have been beneficial,
you know, all pot is medicinal.
I tell everybody that if it makes you feel good,
that's medicinal.
If it changes your mindset, that's medicinal.
It's just my personal opinion.
Yeah, no, I can greatly get on board with that.
So that's really interesting to hear that.
Just to quickly loop back,
you'd mentioned a few other states you'd been to
and brought some cannabis back from.
Over the years, did you ever get a chance
to see the Fayettewood?
Because you mentioned Kentucky.
So I was wondering, did you see Kentucky,
did you see Kentucky bluegrass,
which is a somewhat well-known strain at all?
You know, under that name, I couldn't tell you,
but I probably have in my bank
probably about eight strains left from Kentucky,
older strains, a lot of it's red hair and stinky,
you know, a lot of skunks that don't exist anymore.
But some of those folks,
I can't get in touch with.
I haven't, you know,
I don't know what happened to them over the years.
So some things I'm reluctant to release
simply because I don't know how it'll affect
people that might still be growing it
and their ability to regenerate it,
which is what I do.
I regenerate things.
I do the best I can with what I have
so it doesn't get lost.
But I regenerate the seeds
and try and keep them viable.
But in that process, you know,
I can't, I'm not perfect.
And some things can get lost with parents.
You know, if you're a breeder
and you don't choose or select the exact,
you know, or as close to what you're looking for
in the plant that everybody loves,
you can inadvertently change it
without trying to do so.
And I, you know, challenge any breeder
to keep 10 strains for one year
and try not to change anything
about them from the original donors,
both parents, both, you know,
the original parent lineage.
It's a task, you know.
So like I said,
my currency is time more than anything.
And karma, you know,
if you don't keep a good karma
doing all this,
what I've seen,
especially when it's associated
with all about the money,
that bad things seem to happen
and bad things happen to good people
in those situations.
So you got to keep a clear head
and, you know, just be practical,
just be a farmer.
Yeah, some really wise words there.
I can definitely get on board with that.
Try to keep track of the karma meter.
I would love to quickly run this idea by you
because I see it a lot in the community
as a general sentiment.
Do you believe that there was only ever
one roadkill skunk
or do you think it was a profile
that actually occurred
in maybe a few different strains
and people are just noticing that?
I think there could be a myriad
of roadkills.
I see it within,
with what I've released as an IBL.
I'm down to seven
male plants now
that I use for open pollination.
So the last time I did,
I had 11,
but I went through a series of
the last couple of years
that wasn't so kind to me
as far as illnesses and health.
So during that time,
my help,
I had to have help for a long time.
My help came and went.
So in that process,
I lost some male donor plants,
parent plants for the IBL
and so I had to
create new ones out of seed stock
that I have. So it's changed a bit
even doing that. That's why I say
I challenge anybody to try
and keep the original stock.
All you can do is do the best you can
with what you're given.
Probably if somebody has a large
enough facility
and they run enough phenos,
they can keep
and preserve
exact replicas,
especially doing
tissue culture.
I'm not much of a feminized guy.
I used to do rotalization
which is when the plant gets older
it'll self-germinate
itself.
I was a big believer
in that and trying to preserve an original
mother plant that I may
have been losing. Just let her go to flower,
let her rotalize,
and let her self-pollinate
and basically an S1
just to keep that gene pool
intact.
But I'm no scientist.
I just do the best I can with what
I've learned over the years.
Some people when they start talking
pot or breeding
or preserving strains
with me, they get kind of
I go over their head a little bit
I don't mean to. It's just
this has been my passion for
as long
as I've been alive.
Since I was a teenager, this is what
I did.
My first job was with Matt
Nuska, Thunderfuck.
I took an ad in the paper
to go clean some
buses. I didn't know what it entailed.
I met this old biker dude and he said
I'm raising Hawaiian
fighting dogs in these buses
back here but I got something else going on
can you keep your mouth shut?
I said, yeah.
He said, I'll pay you
well but you have to
promise me you'll keep your mouth shut.
I said, okay, no problem.
What he wanted done was I had to clean
dog shit out of this school bus that
he raised these Hawaiian fighting
dogs in and the other
buses had Matt Nuska
Thunderfuck in them and I had
to keep those
plants going and call
any males in
the smaller plants as they were
showing.
He showed me all of that
and that was a summer job for me.
After a while
he got to trust me so much that
I was able to get
original genetics from him too.
Wow, what an introduction.
Was that your first
hands-on experience with growing?
That was my
first hands-on experience with
just even working with a
pot plant, knowing what was
going on with it.
I didn't know I was going to go
be cleaning school buses with
dog shit
and pot plants in them.
It was
a real
education.
He was up in Anchorage and I was
up there for the summer with
my father when I was younger.
I needed a
job during the day. My dad said,
go get a job. So I went and got a job.
Of course I didn't tell him what I was
doing.
I totally kept my
word. I learned a lot from that
old biker.
So many questions to ask.
Tell me a bit about the Matanuska Thunderfuck.
It's one of those ones where everyone knows
the name and has heard of it but
it's hard to get clear descriptions about
the smells, the flavors,
the overall effect.
It's a
good stone.
A heady stone
gets you
in the place you want to be.
Not debilitating.
Has a lot of
pain killing.
Let you
sleep fairly easy.
I want to say that there has to
be a certain extent of
Afghani
in the original crosses
that I was working with.
Mostly sativa.
Probably a 60-40
on the sativa side.
Without having
genetics or testing, I couldn't tell you
exactly.
Looking at the plants,
they would throw sometimes
narrow leaf, sometimes wide leaf.
You can see the
mix in there.
It was a true hybrid.
Back in the day,
when I was working with this plant,
I talked the guy in to let me
make seeds
because he believed if he was going to
get the plant to someone else
so they could grow it,
he did something called grafting.
He would
take another plant
and graft on
the Matanuska Thunderfuck and get it
to this other guy.
You would think that those genetics
would somehow mix in that plant
but that's how he liked to do it.
He cut a little notch
in the plant. He notched both plants
and then
wrapped it up with some polstice
that he didn't share with me
and bandaged it up.
He would have me set
them off to the side and I would
take care of these things until they were
ready to go to one
of his pals.
It was a way for him to get the actual
plant to someone else that was
going to grow it for
commercial value. They were all bikers.
Like I said, I kept my
mouth shut pretty much up until now
and I still keep my mouth
shut about names and who they are.
In this game
forever
name dropping
was a no-no.
You just didn't do it.
That's what I've
did. I still do that to this day.
There's a lot of people
that get upset about me because they want to know
who the original breeder was
and especially if it's a biker
or a club biker. I'm never
throwing that name out there. I'm never throwing
that affiliation out there.
That's nobody's business but my own.
Running with
that thread, one of the
general lines of
discussion you hear in the cannabis community
is that many of the old school
clones that are now sort of fabled
did have their roots in the biker
scene. Do you think that's true?
Were the bikies sort of reasonably
involved in the cannabis scene over the years?
With
the clubs
you have the ability to have a clubhouse
you're protecting your clubhouse
and you have
basically a sanctuary where
you're not letting the general public in anyway
or law enforcement
usually has to get a
warrant to blow the doors down
and so
that system
of being able to
move things around
clandestinely and
closed mouth people
a lot of genetics
stayed viable
and around because of
what was available
within that
system.
Otherwise they wouldn't
it's just
mainly a culture within a culture
you have the
counterculture
then you had us bikers
I never called myself
a hippie I was always impressed by
I still think to this
day every time I look
at what's going on today I go
yep the hippies were right again
I could never be one but I really
respected their
attitude and what they did
and their resolution to
everything peace and love
and all that
that wasn't me
I didn't live in that world
I kind of kept to myself
That's good I think we need people
from all sort of different corners
to ultimately be represented
so let's jump back into some
RKS stuff because
I know a lot of people are keen to hear about it
so we may as well bash out some of the
more pressing questions I think
that are on people's minds
fairly recently on the show we had
Todd McCormick come on as a great
episode and he
spoke about his friendship with you and
some of the seeds he got off you and he
vouched for your seeds he said hey
the RKS Jaime's got it's real deal
he said you might have to hunt through a few
seeds to find it but he said
you could probably
refine it to be a little more louder
but it was definitely there
what are your thoughts on that is that
how you would describe it to someone who comes
to you and says hey I want to find
that nostril flaring
roadkill skunk
well you know that's a big
controversy and
when I originally agreed
to release it
Todd was one of the people that I always
respected for his sacrifice
and his dedication to his plan
over the years
I reluctantly released
the IBL because I
thought that would release
a wider
variety for somebody to
work with yet
the inside of the IBL
there's definitely the heavy
stinkers all the way
down to you know
some people have reported
not having the heavy
scent or any skunk scent at all
sometimes I've
replaced those because I knew
the people and I knew they weren't
BSing me but you're gonna find
that with phenos that
across the board especially when you're using
11 male donors and I
never work with less than 130
female plants
so
yeah it's
it's hard to
pin it down but I pinned
it down it's just like I
told Todd if I released
you know the absolute stinker
you know what kind of price point
do you put on something like that cause you can only
release it once and then everybody's
knocking it off immediately
and then they're calling
it something else and
I put in
15 years of work on
getting it to where it's at right now
and do I just want to
throw it out there
and everybody said it was too expensive
to begin with when I originally
set it out there and Todd
took it F2'd it
and then released it
and you know dropped the price
down so it was more readily
available I'm not a seed bank
I'm not a big guy
I'm just holding on to
genetics and doing
the best I can
and to be honest with you
I told you
how I made
a living at it was
backing up growers
and other people that were
saying they were breeders I would sell
them I would
go to shows and bring them
six or seven different strains
that they were getting directly from me
but like I say
my business and
the people that I hung out with you
know
so I always believed in
open source genetics
because
anything less I'd just be a hypocrite
that's how I live my life
I would get these genetics
and sometimes
for nothing just to preserve them
and so for me
not to share them
or you know
not trying to get rich
or anything
I just don't want to give something away
I have grandchildren that I hope
that someday that maybe
they'll pick this up and run with it when it's
fully legal and there is
no worries like there is today
I mean globally it still
hasn't been resolved in my opinion
and a lot
of people are left hanging because of that
and like I said if it ever gets
back to how it was I mean that's going to be
a total tragedy but I could see it
moving that way if governments
aren't making the kind of money that they want to make
off of it
those days are gone that's what I tell most of my friends
those days of making all that
money and living the
lifestyle that you were
they're gone for good
but fortunately a lot of the strains
aren't because there's a few crazy
guys like myself who've hung on
to things
yeah you know what it's so
interesting that you touch on that topic
about like those days are gone
I feel like I have that
conversation with people more and more
you hear people talking about how
producers who used to produce
the best quality herb are getting out of the game
and I always just say
yeah yeah yeah you can't make like
30k off your crop
every 3 months anymore it's not like
that but you look at other farmers
they're not making any wind like you know
someone growing corn or whatever they don't grow that sort
of money and I feel like there's this sort of
underlying entitlement
and I try to explain look like
yeah the reason why you got paid that in the past
was because of the very real threat
and to a large degree
you know there's less threat depending
on where you're based and they
don't seem to understand that like that's where
that price was coming from was from the
threat and now that that's gone
that's the price is dropping
would you say that over time
cannabis will become
like corn in the sense that like
it'll just become like an everyday
farmer sort of income
I'm sure of it and the people
that continue on will
do it for the love of farming
and for the love of the plant
and you know the culture
and mystique that went behind this plant
for all these ages
I mean
I saw all this stuff
from the 60s, 70s, 80s
90s now we're up
into 2000s and
I'm still seeing stuff everyday
if you keep your eyes open
and you appreciate things for what they are
you don't
miss
just myself
I can only keep so much alive
and preserve
that I loved and my
friends loved and
some friends profited from
but there's
you know there's no way
that any one person
can keep a lot of
things together for a long
period of time and I'm
slowly learning that and I
lose stuff everyday just because I
can't do what I used to do
I used to do up to 1200 plants
in rotation
every year
three different cycles
and try and keep the seeds
regenerated so they were
somebody wanted them, they were viable
they germinated right away
they were good strong
genetics and they were as close
to or equal to
what people remember
them being
so like I said without
DNA testing or
actual genetic testing
it's hard to
say you know
when you're getting
from different sources I try to source
things myself from the regions
I go to and
for years that was my vacation
go somewhere and
it was my job to
get strains from
some people go to the bar and
after work I go look for
cannabis seeds and
you know you get them from the
strangest
sources and sometimes some of the best
people that you ever want to meet
you got in some really scary
crazy situations even for me
being a biker
I tell you a lot of times I'm like
man is this guy going to kill me
you know a pig farmer
comes to mind you know
he talks some crazy stuff
but man he had the best weed in the world
that I'd seen to
that day and I just wanted that
strain that he had
so to get it
I had to put myself in a
situation that I probably wouldn't
do today
don't mean to ramble on but it's been a long
strange trip and yeah dead shows were really
good for them a dead head
and those shows were
a blast thanks to the hippies
and dead heads everywhere but
I wasn't much of a dancer
standing in the middle of 30,000
people jumping up and down and dancing
is a real experience
that you know I wish
everybody could experience because
it does change your heart as a
person I was pretty callous
after coming out of the military
and you know a lot
different person than I am today I was a lot
harder biker but
you know cannabis and
dead heads pretty much changed
my life for me for the positive
yeah that's beautiful to hear
you're sort of echoing the sentiment
almost every guest on this show
has said I think that's
probably one of the most
unknown things to the general public
is how much of a contribution
the Grateful Dead played to cannabis
over the past 40 years
oh yeah Shakedown Street
you could get anything you wanted on
Shakedown Street and
a lot of people
you know my alias I'm Ichiba
a lot of people knew
my alias as that crazy
guy that's looking for seeds
and is willing to pay so
I got scammed a lot
but I got some great genetics
on Shakedown Street too
that's great I love it
so if we link
back to sort of some of the
details of the answers you've given already
you talk about how you've had
quite decent plant numbers
in terms of your when you're creating
seed but I know at the same
time you're not exactly operating
on scale so it's sort of like
you've got a relatively
small to medium scale set up but
lots of plant numbers in there
how do you find it is
navigating that because I think for a lot of people they get
quite scared by the idea of how many
plants you have in that space
right well I was
pretty lucky on
having remote property
and then people that were interested
in making their living
by selling unseeded
weed that we would grow
side by side with
my seeded plants
so to enlist those people
to help me with my work
which is pretty extensive when you're growing
1200 plants on your own
it's almost impossible
to get two or three people to help
me with that work during
the summer season was
a godsend so
I had some remote
cabins and a large lodge
to work in and
pretty much so
remote that we never hardly
ever saw anybody there Canadian
miners would stop by
every once in a while
I was amazed at how
close mouthed they were about
everything and non
judgmental you know a bottle of
whiskey bought a mile
of zipper on their
mouse you know so
or just having cigarettes
around or you know
somebody wasn't into pot
they were always into something else
they pretty much kept quiet
about things and we only had
real trouble one time
that I can remember in all those
years so
it's not easy
to do anything
outside of
your own home
large scale
and as far as breeding
I wouldn't recommend
unless you have large outbuildings
and you can do
isolation work and you can isolate
your males you can isolate
clones that you might bring in
from someone else to work with that genetic
material unless you have
specific build outs
rooms to
separate
and segregate
your plants and your plant stock
and your strains then you're
doing yourself and everyone else
a disservice by
trying to breed under those circumstances
so like I said I got
lucky but there were people
profiting off of what I did
I just I wasn't interested
in that and no one could understand
my preoccupation
with seeds even myself probably
I would
compare myself to a crazy
collector that you might see
on one of those
television programs that
these guys go through
a hoarder you know
but in my instance
they're walking through all these plants
going why is all
your weed seeded are you nuts
so I mean I got
that for years
for most of my life so
the transition to all of
a sudden people are interested in things like
Acapulco Gold and Panama Red
I'm like have you even tried
it I mean it looked like skanky weed
back in the day it's
you know bunk compared to
what you think of as
great weed you're showing me you're telling me
there's a lot of weed snobs where I live
right here in
Alaska and
I might have created that problem
because over the years
they've had access to
some things that people will never see in a lifetime
so
to be able to smoke that kind of weed
you know generates a
certain type of person over
time I can't apologize
for it either
I envy those people gosh
so there's some weird
parallels there you got me thinking about my
brother who's like only a very
casual weed smoker and I try
to explain to him I'm like dude you understand
like the shit I'm giving you
like no one gets to try this
exactly
exactly
okay so it sounds like you're quite
a fan of open pollinating
is that the primary method in which you choose
to breed and is there any degree of
sort of selection around the males or it's just
like everything stays and does
its thing? No
only when I'm doing IBL's
does that happen
when I'm breeding I breed
if I'm going to bring something to an F5
I'll back cross it a couple
of times
I'm looking for traits
I'm looking for recessive traits
I'm looking for traits that
I want to keep in the plant
and to do that
that selection
I keep away from everybody else
you know especially when I was
having people growing
commercial weed right alongside what I'm
trying to do they knew certain
rooms are off limits to them
because I didn't want an introduction
of a pollen from a male
room I didn't want to have
you know cross pollination
I didn't want to have any
kind of issues so
you know I've
been called an asshole more than once
over my protocols
with having people
grow for me
you know had quite a few
people quit you know saying
just way too strict I had to loosen up
and smoke more of what I'm growing
but
to do it right
and to keep
it for the
future I mean
the future for me is now just making
sure that it goes to
family and
friends that a lot of these things
can be carried on and shared with everybody
else
but yeah I don't
have the health
and longevity
no one lives forever
and I've been pushing the
limits
you know to keep these things
in a box
would be a crime and I've always said
that you know everybody says what are you going to
do with all those damn seeds
you know you've got you know for a long time
I used to feed old seeds to chickens
and
yeah then one friend talked me out
of it and he started a seed
a seed bank and a business out
of it and I go well maybe I just
ought to hang on to those old seeds
oh yeah there's a reason why you thought
you shouldn't give them to the chickens
that's interesting
that's interesting okay
so are there any specific sort of
traits or what you might
consider to be like telltale signs
that you look for in a male that you
think oh that's like usually a sign
of a good male
you know I've tried
to tell everybody I've mentored a lot
of different growers some of them
are on Instagram some of them
personally here
at home and the first
thing I look for in a seedling
when it pops up
is that it develops
like trichome hairs on it
or it doesn't
so a shiny leaf usually
that phenol I'll eliminate
it right away I'll start out with
a thousand seedlings and
pretty quickly get down to a hundred
the same thing goes
with the male when I start
turning a male I'm looking for
it to actually produce
its trichomes early
and have a resinous coating
on the stock itself
so a lot of people
have said well your weed
gets me I don't want to go to
the dispensary because your weed
gets me stoned more than
you know even though it's seeded
than anything at the dispensary
I'm like well if we don't support
these people then we're
going to lose legalization
so you know I can still
give you stuff but not in the
amounts that I have before
and please support those people
I'm doing this to
breed
not to sell
specifically
yeah it's hard to explain
I sound like a crazy person to myself
now
no no no you're on the money and I think
we are really congruent in a lot of our
beliefs I'd love to ask you
you sort of without directly
touching on it did reference some of the
problems with the dispensaries not just
the quality of the dispensaries which
is a problem sometimes but more
importantly that there seems to be
a lack of consumer
education occurring at
the dispensaries and we're in this position
now where someone walks into a dispensary
and they just say what's got
the highest THC percentage like
that's sort of where we're at
how do you think we can help move past
this and help educate the casual
consumer who in all honesty
probably never gonna wanna learn too much
about you know the
genesis of chem dog or whatever
they just wanna get high but how do we
reach that sort of customer and help
keep the legalization fight alive
I think with
what you're doing and I really
believe in it
with a really good
book we need a book out there that's as
simple as possible I mean just
as simple as it can possibly be
with the best tips on growing
the best possible weed and the best
possible weed starts with
the best possible genetics
you can get your hands on
and seeds are viable
so like I said
before my motto
to everybody has always been since
day one since I started
moving genetics
moving seeds was
if in doubt grow it out
if you have any doubt
about my strains
or what I'm
trying to preserve just grow
it out and then you can give me
feedback on what you're
finding but don't bitch before you've
grown it out don't buy into
the anti-hype
what also
needs to happen is this needs to become
a more positive
in my I know I don't live
in rainbows and fairy tales
but it needs to be more of a positive
community where
we're aiding each other
you know kind of the reason I'm doing the podcast
we're teaching the younger
generation hey you don't have as
many roadblocks or hurdles to go
through so concentrate
on teaching people
about the benefits of cannabis
and the benefits
of growing your own and
the benefits of growing the
best you can possibly grow
turn it into a competitive
like I always believe in competitive sports
very highly competitive person
turn it
into a competitive sport you know
who can outgrow their
friends and using what genetics
things like that
got us to where
we're at today and the hippies
they were
a huge part in it you know that
whole subculture
God bless them you know if they hadn't
kept it alive it would have
disappeared and there was a lot of
obstacles in the way
lots
yeah hugely I can see that from my
perspective when I talk to people I
can certainly identify in my own
journey that it feels as though it's been
certainly a lot easier than many
of the stories I hear from guests
I just wanted to quickly loop
back one moment to the RKS
because I think a sentiment
that I hear really commonly in the
community is people keep saying
look if the RKS really
existed it would be out
we'd all be sharing the clone and like
that would be the end of it
I guess the gist of it is like if it exists
it would have been found
what's your thoughts to that sentiment
well I don't
particularly know
that my
roadkill skunk that I
you know inherited
from someone else they passed on
too
I don't know if it's what
people were trying somewhere else
I personally
can't remember a smell
or taste from a
week ago maybe yesterday
I could remember a smell
or taste specifically
but a week ago
no so
all these years down the road
I will tell you that it was actively
you know supplying
people with these seeds and
with clones up and down the
Pacific up I-5
up and down I-5
the Pacific Northwest Corridor especially
but I'd go all the way to San Diego
because I was trading genetics down there
years ago too and there was
some awfully good genetics that came out of
San Diego especially
in the 90s
and you know a lot can be done in full
sun that can't be done
indoors so
you know my hat's off to the guerrilla
growers that risk
fires
law enforcement
feral animals
it was unbelievable when somebody in
almost a desert climate
was able to produce
outdoors just blow me away
and of course I wanted
any genetics I could cull from
that and
I went out of my way to find them
Yeah I think we have heard in the past
about some mythical strains coming out
of San Diego so sounds like
you're in the right spot at the right time
which is beautiful to hear
I wanted to quickly follow up
I'd seen on your Instagram that
you had crossed what I think
is an RKS male
to a few different things like doing outcrosses
Right! and I was interested to hear
your thoughts because obviously
you know a lot of people are keen on the IBL
but I'm interested to hear about the outcrosses
because I think outcrossing
is the spice of life to me
so yeah I noticed
specifically you did a Bubba Kush outcross
I'm such a big fan of Bubba Kush
how did that one turn out and what sort of things
do you think RKS brings to the table
when you do hybridize it
Well I select
actually for
like I did
when I'm at probably about
an F13 right now on
what I've worked the RKS
up to now and that includes
8 backcrosses
looking for select
traits and it really is
it's a
complex
strain to work with to
find those recessive traits
to get rid of some and to
amend others
so over time that was
that was really
difficult but I mean
the chem dog that I got
from Tricome Tech
in the 90's
there were a couple of guys in
kind of central northern California
that had an
ad in high times I got their chem dog
I got quite a few different
strains from them
that I bought online at the time
and I heard that
they were really finicky
like I was
you know just
I don't know you get
you get to a point where other people just
think you're a mad scientist
and you know kind of
like the Cheech and Chong movie
Nice Dreams where the guy
down in the pool
his name was Jimmy and they go in there
and ask him a question
and that's all he'd say was big buds
and you kind of get to be that
guy and that's I got poked a
lot of fun out over the years
that you know because I had friends
come and you know getting weed
you know they're just out trying to
you know score a bag the best way they could
and the best way they could was hey let's
go see if Jim needs a hand
or you know go out there
and check out his place
and if he needs a hand with something maybe we
could score some weed
the back crosses have
been
probably like you say some of the most interesting
things that I've done for a while
I didn't know
that the road kill
had that potential
I've already gotten back from several
people seeds
with their
crosses with road kill
one comes to mind
a blueberry that I recently
received from somebody and
I popped in there
I could give you results at
a later date but
everything I've crossed it with
turns out to be
a better plant
but it retains a lot of
the road kill skunk
scent to it
so even throwing it in
skunk number one
I've got
skunk number one and super skunk
I threw it into that
I've got nirvana super skunk
I threw it into that
all it did was accentuate that skunk
and make it stronger with
when I'm using the males
now when you're using the females
and you're
crossing to a male of a different
parentage
you're finding
that it's not as heavy
on the skunk side
so
you're not getting those
terps coming through as heavy as if
you used the male
road kill skunk
as parent
if that makes any sense
I'm trying to keep them as F1
but I've sent them out
to testers
four corners of this nation
I use a tester, a friend of mine
in Maine who's been working with me
for years
a friend of mine in Florida, same thing
a friend of mine in San Diego
and a friend of mine in Seattle, Washington
I also have a friend in Canada
that's been running
a lot of my stuff
and I take everything they give me
and try and improve upon
it but the F1s are saying
I've been using the road kill skunk
by
different crosses
I can give you a list of some of the
crosses I recently did
and
they came out phenomenal
but I guess
I'm never happy
that's the problem about
being a breeder and having the original
genetics to work
with, you're never happy
with what somebody else
says, oh this is great because you see
something that no one else does
because you've worked with that particular
plant for so long
yeah look, a true perfectionist
yeah to a point
that it really irritates a lot of people
I can't apologize
for it because it's taken me
to here
but as far as
breeders
using
my genetics
I just
like with Todd's situation
I really respect Todd
you know and
I like what he's doing
and trying to preserve the seeds
but I honestly think
it's in his best interest to send things out
to test
because he'll grow more
as a breeder
and if he learns to take
other people's
and wherever
they're at
and they're growing
they might not even be as
competent a grower
as Todd is but they might be
better at breeding and finding
recessive traits and things that
he's just not looking for
sadly
yeah
the Bubba Kush that you mentioned
I got from
a breeder and
he's
in the southern part of Washington state
really well known
I met him on a seed
trip I was in this group
and Facebook
that was my introduction to this
another crackpot guy named Preston
White
started a seed group and a lot of
people I know to this day on Instagram
and they're prolific breeders now
they started out
trading genetics and that's all I
did was just trade genetics
try and get some of this stuff out
there that I thought
was just going to disappear otherwise
but they were really interested in it
and they were really interested in
crossing using
those strains to cross with
a friend of mine in Michigan
he's a good guy
he
got a company called 517
he has used a lot of these
older strains
and crossed them to newer stuff
some of the hype stuff that
I'm not familiar with and I don't
have the wherewithal to
preserve them because I've got
so much in my library as it
is
on your Instagram feed
I saw that there was Mac
crossbred kill skunk is this where that
project came from?
yeah that was
this is a recent project
the Mac
really kind of blew me away
because it doesn't accept pollen
very well
yeah I think actually
funny you mention that just a few days
ago some studies came out
showing that Mac is one of the few
true polyploidy
plants out there so it's
effectively as you said yeah
obviously you can make
crosses with it if you really force it
but generally speaking as you said doesn't want to take pollen
oh yeah
a lot of trifolate on it
on the Mac
and to get it to pollenoid
I had to use six different
I finally found the right
male that it would accept pollen from
from the RKS
and yeah I'm currently
working on that
trying to get it to be
more stable
but the results are
alarmingly great
the reports
last summer from the
the F1's that I sent
out
were just great
and I thought so too
when I grew it out unseeded
I'm like oh wow this is
really good stuff
I don't want to take somebody's
genetics without their
authorization and release it to
anybody so I didn't
until I run into
that fellow with the fake beard
at the Emerald Cup again
or one of the shows
then I wouldn't even
think about releasing it unless
I got his approval
and I'd make sure he got seed stock first
I think Cap's a pretty
reasonable guy and he would probably
take you up on that offer
yeah I don't know him but
I'm just saying
that's what I do
I preserve stuff and then I
work with stuff that I really like
but I was still really surprised that
some of my more
resilient male
donors for
pollen were not
accepted by this Cap's
cut that I
sourced
and I was
just blown away by its
production by not seeding it
so I thought this is one
that I'm going to go ahead
and push forward
another friend of mine
Antonio Diaz
great guy met him on this
group the seed
trading group that Preston White
started
he created a strain
called Lamula
and it was just out of this world
so I had to add the
roadkill skunk to that
and trying to dial that in
right now the F1's
they're just
producing but the yields are really low
on it and it was more of
a diesel plant
had the real strong diesel turps
but you add that to RKS
and honestly
roadkill skunk just pales
in comparison as
to the skunk turps that are thrown out
there from that added diesel
wow
ok so that could be the real
fuely gassy
in combo with the RKS
right
I took
Soma's New York City
diesel and I crossed it to
roadkill skunk and that
also produced some awesome F1's
that I recently released
just blew me away
that diesel
was actually
a fuel for the skunk
turps
just kicked it up a notch
even more than
where I've gotten my F13
roadkill skunk
I'm like well this stinks heavier
I mean it lingers
in the room
if you wipe the walls
you're getting that perspiration
from the plant
and you go outside and it stinks
to high heaven
that's really
interesting to hear because I
could see that you have worked with
some other modern genetics
in the past specifically
the driving rain which uses
Sanse Sherbert, Bruce Banner
Purple Afghani
it sort of made me wonder was there
anything specifically that stimulated
you to think you know what
I'm going to do a cross with some more modern stuff
because I think largely it's
probably one of the only crosses
you offer that doesn't have quite
a what's the word
a provenance to it
a very long established sort of
history was there anything that stimulated you
to do that one
you know a friend of mine
wanted a Sherbert
so I went in search of a Sherbert
I got my hands on
a Sunset Sherbert
cuttings
in Fremont Washington
at the High Times Cannabis Cup
and a guy there
had them and you know
he said yeah this is a great Sherbert
but it's not the original Sherbert
you gotta try this
it's called Sunset Sherbert from
this dude I'll call Sherbinsky
and I said well cool man
and yeah I'll buy some clones
from you and I brought
them home and
you know that cross
is epic up here
Driving Rain is probably
one of the most
surprising
I would say killer crosses
that I've ever created
it's a beautiful plant
the terpenes are
across the map
the stone I think
because of Dark Horse's
genetics in there the Bruce Banner
number three that I used
it was a bomber
yeah I wasn't into polys
and I wanted to try my hand
at polyhybrids
because my belief
and a lot of others beliefs with
if you use any more than
one indica or one sativa
or two sativas or two indicas
as a hybrid
you're gonna breed
out resiliency
some of the
environmental
factors that a
strong genetic plant
brings to the table or a land race
something that's been grown by people
for generations
as food or medicine
and once you breed
out of that then you're gonna
lose some of
the stability of the plant itself
here that
particular cross is one of my favorites
as far as
what it's done to help people
medicinally I mean I know
there's only two cancer survivors here
that grew it out
and it's had wonderful
results for them
locally
and they swear by it and they keep
you know growing that
particular strain
so you know as far
as what it's done
it out produced my
wildest imagining on
polyhybrids and it kinda
changed my mind
on polyhybrids cause that particular
plant even though it's more
sativa leaning outside
our growing season ends
in October it'll finish
before October outside up here
even in a rainy environment
with no powdery mildew
so the strains that I used
in there seem to
retain their strength and
vigor and pass on
some of their ability
with environmental stresses
to
stand the test of time
so it's a strain for me
it's funny you bring that up cause I don't really advertise it that much
because it's been so
great locally
I should have made more F1's of that
it looks like
a killer on paper
it sort of caught my eye so I thought
yeah that seems like a good one to talk about
out of curiosity was there any
specific reason you thought that
purple Afghani would pair well
with that sort of more modern combo
to tell you the honest truth
that purple Afghani is one of the first
that I personally sourced
in
Afghanistan myself
wow, yeah
I almost got in trouble for that particular
plant but
I happened to glean the seeds
off the plant and
tell a few fibs to get
myself back to where I had to be
and back to the States
and I'm still with them
so yeah
that Afghani has thrown
a blue
tint
into everything that I've grown
and bred with
bred towards certain things
I bred a blueberry
years and years ago here
40 years ago
we have a blueberry festival
here so somebody was like
hey man why don't you have
I said well you know I'll work
that's a good idea I'll work towards that
and that was one of the
things I used but you cut the plant
some
sorry if I'm rambling on but some Colombians
and Mexicans will bleed
a red
well this purple Afghani bleeds
purple and it will stain
anything I mean it actually
stains the blood from that plant
will stain clothing
fabric, paper,
but as far
as a breeding stock
it brings a blue beautiful lavender
tint to anything I put
into it and that's what I was trying to bring
out when I added it in
with that Sunset Sherbert
because it already had that
lilt already it had that
lavender vibrancy
but I didn't think it was deep enough
so I added that and
that brought it up a notch
and the Bruce Banner
to be quite honest with you a lot of my strains
were medicinal for people here
and
I told a local dispensary owner
that I was adding this Bruce Banner
I added it to Green Crack
and that's just been a stellar
stellar stellar plant
both they sell it
commercially in their dispensary
got the seeds from
me and have been growing it out
and a skunk by Bruce Banner
has been available locally
here too and it's been a knockout
success
so I wanted to increase
people get to a certain point
where pot doesn't get them stoned anymore
and if they're using it
for medicine if it's not getting them
stoned they begin to look for something
else and they said you know I
love these strains can you take these
strains and make
them a little stronger somehow and I said
well I'll try my best
and I think I know a strain
at the time Dark Horse
had produced
you know it was fairly new
the Bruce Banner number 3
was coming out as the most
stable so I used it
and it
actually increased the THC level
where people were just
going nuts over you know
they wanted to grow their own
and that was actually before
legalization
we've been legal in Alaska since
1975
Raven vs. Alaska
if anybody wants to look it up
we won the rights
to legalization
different administrations have tried to
make it legal, illegal but
Alaska's Constitution
and that was the key
kept it legal in Alaska
since 1975
no matter what the efforts of
prohibitionists was to change
that fact so even
if you just brought that up in court
along with the government
having a medicinal patent on marijuana
pretty much you won
every court case that you had
the nuts and the
money to go to court with
yeah definitely a
definingly unique characteristic
of Alaska
just to sort of follow up
on what we've been talking about
I was curious are there any modern
strains that do impress you
it sounds like largely speaking
you enjoy the more old world
strains but does anything
strike you as special
or as unique
as maybe say the roadkill
you know
the roadkill is
it's just a
special strain period
it takes you back
it's basically a time travelling
strain, what I call
several of these strains
because the unique effect is to bring you
back to that time and place where
you were driving down
the road listening to BTO
taking care of business
and you were all that back in
the day again
except you know in actuality
you're an old fat man and
you're cruising down the road in an old truck
so yeah
for those
specific things that I look for
I'm not looking
for a time travel weed
I'm looking for a
spatial weed that
takes you out there
and then lets you down
fairly easy towards
the end of the day
I'm really working with sativas
a lot right now from Columbia
and Mexico
trying to find that one
specific hybrid
that will do that again
I used to have in my stable
a couple
Punta Rojo
comes to mind
that were an all day stone
pretty much
the fabled 3 hour high
that you could kick around town
and do everything you wanted to do
but still be
high with a positive outlook
so anything
that does that for me
and somebody turns me on to it
I start to
disseminate it
figure out how it grows
somebody tells me
about a specific stone
like that
that's what I'm after
personally
and for people that
medicinally
I lost 2 wives to cancer
and those strains
when I was growing
them out
to uplift them
to give them a normal day
without opiates
to help raise my children
to bring a level
of happiness to them
in the
process of death
there's no higher
calling for cannabis in my opinion
in my personal opinion
and in my
experience with it
I had police
come to my house
ready to kick down the door
because somebody reported
smelling a grow at this house
I was in the
yard in handcuffs
my wife was upstairs
she'd lost all her hair from chemo
and
I told them
look officer
before you go in
you're going to go in and take my wife's medicine
I'm serious about this
she's been told
there's not much left
she's just trying to be here
for our little children
so just tread
carefully I'll go with you
and tell you anything you want
I can tell you right where my
grow is
downstairs in my garage
just be careful
with what's there
be respectful
he went in the house
I went in
I took my wife
walked out
came and unlocked my cuffs
and this is when it was still
super illegal
there was no compassion or anything
he says you know we didn't find anything
in there
he says you have a great day
I'm sorry to have bothered you
but I had to investigate this
and I have to fill out my report now
and I'll just say that there was
and that's where it ended
and to this day
I've never been able to thank that guy
but you know
that's the kind of positive stuff that
that I like to see
behind cannabis
you know what it does to help other
people is way
beyond anything that I'm personally
doing I don't have any
aspirations
or you know financial
aspirations or otherwise
I'm just a crazy old guy
that's preserved a bunch of strains
and worked with what I can
to help other people
and to me I made good
money at doing what I did
for a living as a commercial diver
and a union electrician
that I could support
my family just off of that
what I
did otherwise just a crazy hobby
that no one could really quite figure
out they're like well you don't sell pot
but you help
people with seeds and you give seeds away
and what's all that about
and I really could never tell
anybody that's probably the most I've ever
talked about it
outside of a few friends here that know me
Oh what a
really personal and touching story
you know thank you so much for sharing that
I think you really hit
the head of the problem of our community
which is yeah sometimes I think we lose
sight of what the real
utility of this plant is which is
to help us all get through life a little bit
easier if you're
willing to discuss are there any
strains you have that
if someone listening was a little bit unwell
themselves you might
recommend from your catalogue that might
be what you feel is particularly medicinal
well because of
the profile that's left
in it the 1974
Matanuska Thunderfuck
is one of the best because
it has the CBD still in the plant
the CBG
the THC
V it hasn't been bred out
it's been
you know as much as I could
kept it as close as possible
the Maui Wowie
is at an F18
it's about
it's about as original
as they come
my Concha Cambodian
it's a really good
Cambodian that like I said
it has the THC
and CBD
it's not a really high
soaring
like a Thai
but it's a heavy enough stone
and I think
it's essential to people's
mental well-being it really
brings about
a calming effect
you know
I have a strain called
FOB
which is Forward Operating Base
I created it specifically
for people with PTSD
you know fellow veterans
and
you'd be surprised
how many people have
PTSD were never veterans
but life experiences
trauma
a range of crimes
that were committed against people
just even growers
you know that have spent years
like myself there's only a certain
amount of crazy people that can stay
locked up in
little rooms growing plants for
all these years waiting for
you know a gun at your back of your head
or your door to be kicked in
or you know that
mentality
you need something that is
going to help you everyday
that's what I created
FOB for
I've made
that available as much as I can
to anybody that needs it
a chocolate tie that I picked up
years ago
down in California
it's one of those tie
strains that
really helps with anxiety
mental
fatigue a lot of people are
just worn out it's helped a lot of my friends
just recently with
everything going on from COVID lock
up to just even
wearing a mask you know they tell me
hey I have to go out with this damn
thing everywhere if I
smoke some of that chocolate tie
I'm cool I don't lose
it I'm not too high I don't
have any anxiety and I can
get done what I need to get done
while wearing that mask
masked it on
is a
very sedative
indica
plant it's a combination
of two local strains two growers
that I
inherited their strains are passed
on now so I combined them
and called them masked it on
years ago
20 some years ago
it's a beautiful plant
very gassy
but it's a strong
sedative painkiller
and it helps with insomnia
and sleep problems
the cat piss I got in
I originally sourced
it in
Garberville
but I had to go to San Diego to actually get
the cuttings
that was owned by a
motorcycle club
proprietary
genetics they didn't want to
really release it they asked me not to release
it in its
form but they knew I was breeding
they said you can go ahead and cross it to
whatever you want just leave our name
off of it
so the cat piss
has
an effect a speedy effect
pick you up
move you throughout the day
get you from point A to point B
that's why it was really popular with
the biker culture
and for something like that
when somebody's trying to recover
it just
over and above any other strain I've ever
seen the cat piss crossed
with just about anything
picks people up and propels them
through the day it's a really
good
strain for recovery in my
opinion
I could keep going
what I'm picking
up is that you're obviously very
passionate about old school lines
and I'd be interested to find out
what are some of your absolute favorites
because something I've picked up as a
sort of recent trend is that
more and more I feel like there's
a wider appreciation
for Mexican lines
Acapulco Gold, Punta Rojo
even Colombian
people really really getting into
these strains what are some of the most
memorable lines in your mind
I love Michoacan
Michoacan is
one of those Mexican
strains so
another Mexican
strain I have
two different
Oaxacans
Oaxaca is a large
district kind of like
a state here in the United States
you know it's a large district so
the Oaxacan
that I have comes from
more of a hill
mountainous region
part of Oaxaca
so it has
THCV
and THC
and CBD in it has some of its
original
and it
retains a lot of its
vigor
that it has outdoors when grown
indoors and it's not
a super long flowering
plant
for a sativa dominant
so that Oaxacan
yeah it's
been worked a lot
probably before I got it
probably by original
cartels
basically
built Mexican drug cartels
a lot of people don't know this was
marijuana
before they got into anything else
marijuana was the product of
Mexico and when it
crossed the border it was degraded because
they pressed it into bricks and
cemented and got mold in it
and there's a whole lot of chemistry
that happened in them bricks
but if you could source
the weed like I did
across the border and
actually go to where the growers
were
growing the plants those
Mexican breeders and growers
were really knowledgeable and
ahead of their time I mean
we got sensimilia
seedless weed
from the Mexican people
back in that era I mean
if it hadn't been for them
trying to develop a seedless product
to send across the border
you know it was just a matter
of time before people discovered
wow we get you know a better
stone and a heavier product
if we don't let it seed
but you know
you gotta give credit where credit's due too
with marijuana and cannabis
history the people that
came before us the people that really
did the work and I'm a huge
believer in
putting in the work
so your end product
meets or exceeds what people are looking for
yeah
I know it's not a popular thing
I love that
one of our listeners
our Patreon supporters asks
can you ask if he can
expand a little bit on his creation
Big Tuna
that stuff looks killer
Big Tuna
I
yeah
Big Tuna
I can't really
it's not my creation
so I don't want to take credit for it
it's just something I've continued
on to this day and that's a person
that created that strain
is recently deceased
so you know I kind of
just recently
with the relatives
on what I could
do with that strain and right now they're just
kind of they're not talking about a lot of
things and this seemed to be
their least priority
in life so
yeah
sorry not to answer that
question
it's understandable you know more sort of pressing things on
their mind at the moment so you can appreciate
that obviously
we've got another fan submitted question
which I'm actually very curious about myself
they said can you ask Jaime
about the poster he's got that says
good for the head Panama Red
good for the head
well you know
there's a no I don't know if you
listen to a lot of music but there's an old
stoner band called
Riders of the Purple Sage
you know Jerry Garcia
played in there for a while
so they had a song called
Panama Red and if you listen
to it you'll hear
similar lyrics to that
in the song
there you go so it's like an old sort of Jerry
throwback well yeah
New Riders of the Purple Sage
you know if I had
the album's almost within arm reach
you know I
grabbed the album and show you
but yeah if you just look up
New Riders of the Purple Sage
on the front the artwork
cover of the album
is a picture of Panama Red
himself you know so
it's a great old song
and that
probably that particular post
came from that
yeah okay that makes
sense while I was cruising
through all the strains you offered
I noticed that Alaskan
Cannabis Case sells just a straight
Afghani and I was curious to know
like what's the origins of
this Afghani is it from Afghani number
one or something you collected
that's
actually a great story
in itself I
went to Innsbruck
for the Winter Olympics
and I ran into a hippie couple
that was had
traveled all the way from India
through Afghanistan
and
I asked
them you know we're
back and forth talking I was a young
man and really interested
in sports at the time and
basically there to
you know first Olympics I
was ever able to attend
just see what's
going on there but I'd run into
people that were as interested
in marijuana as I was
and were transporting seeds so they
had some pure
Afghani from
an Afghani farmer they stayed
with for about a week
and he helped them make
some bricks of hash which they were
going from at that time
Innsbruck Germany to somewhere
in France
I don't remember where and I
probably wouldn't say if I did but
then they brought it back to the
States and I actually
got in touch with them in California
again and
got picked up some of that black hash that
they brought back that they were
of making in Afghanistan
but
I kept those seeds
forever
pure Afghani
you would call it a landrace
but
when it was grown commercially
I don't know if you can call that a landrace
because somebody's growing it
for the production of hash
not for the plant
itself
if you saw what they did
to the plants
it's almost abhorrent
to us because yeah
it's all about beating the hell out of the plants
and the seeds go flying
everywhere and for somebody
like me I've witnessed that a couple of times
once in Morocco and
another time in Afghanistan
myself and I'm like oh my god
let me pick these up
for you
I can imagine
that's hilarious
I had also noticed
on your Instagram that you
had grown out some Pakistanis
sort of more recently in fact
and I wanted to ask you about your thoughts on it
because I feel like Pakistanis
like a great indica that often gets
overlooked because of the fact
that Afghanistan's right next to it and
obviously Afghani is just
incredible in its own right but yeah what's your thoughts
on Pakistanis do you think they're a little bit
underrated
way underrated
the Chitral area
what you're referencing to
probably
the purple
Pakistani Chitral Kush
that's a
river regional area
very beautiful area
and those people take
extreme pride
in their production
of hash but
their plants are
just astounding
the vibrancy
of the colors of purples
that come out of those
and the production
of trichomes
to see them outdoors
it's almost
magical
my recollections of actually seeing them in that
area
got me kind of hooked on
you're right that's something I just
worked on recently
so a Pakistani
Chitral Kush I'm trying to get it
to an
F4 right now
it's at an F3 it's been to testers
I back crossed it once
trying to pull it up
to an F4
it'll be a hard push for me
because I've got a lot of
other projects going on right now
so that'll probably be
a year off before I even think about
releasing that but yeah it's a
beautiful plant
we'll all have to wait with anticipation
you almost
answered the next question for me
so I'll try to bait it out of you a little more
I'm always curious to ask breeders
what is the thing that you're most
excited about like what's the next project
you're about to start that you're like oh man
this one's going to be great
yeah and you know
again I call myself a
preservationist
but I've really taken
to this breeding thing because I've
been
lucky and fortunate enough
to be able to access
all these different genetics
and to be able to
cross them together
is just
phenomenal and I've
worked extensively with Hawaiian strains
trying to bring back
some of the original Hawaiian strains
and I'm
working again to
to bring the Haleakala
Silver Sword
up to its
it was grown on the back
side of Hana
the back side of the Haleakala crater
at a pretty good elevation in the
jungle
by several growers from
Lower Nuhiku Road
and they're prominent growers
they've been doing it all their lives
basically since they got back
from Vietnam
they went back to California
long enough to
to get discharged from the
service, went right over
to Hana and became
pot growing hermits
these guys are
exceptional
it's actually my
honor to preserve
that particular strain
and to bring it back
so that's what I'm trying to do
and they're
old enough where
that's all past, that's not something
that they're doing anymore
but they're all behind me and want to know
its progress so that's something
I'm actively working on
right now and look forward
to getting it
stabilized
That's really exciting
I think that there would be a lot of people
interested in that one
I mean we've spoken a lot
about the Indica's
and you mentioned you've got
a profound love of Sativas
I too actually really love Sativas myself
and I noticed there was a few posts
on your Instagram
of some sneaky Neville's Hayes
slash Neville's Hayes hybrids
obviously
Todd has sort of made some ripples in the water
with his re-releases of Hayes
more recently
do you think that the Neville's Hayes
is what you would consider to be one of the
better representations of Hayes
or do you think that maybe like
an NL5 Hayes is like a better
sort of representation in your mind
Well Neville's Hayes
I had the unique opportunity
to meet Neville
and play chess with him
and talk to him and I have a different
perception of the man
and his ethos
than most people do
everybody degrades
to the worst common denominator
and if you didn't
get to know him and know what a kind
giving person he was
and what an exceptional breeder
he was, he actually made
such an imprint on me
that I just continued doing what I was
doing and didn't think I was completely nuts
for doing so
because he was
you know making good money doing
what he was doing, taking a lot of chances
his family
was 100% behind him
he was also
an Australian
great personality, I mean always outgoing
I didn't see any
of the things that some people
accused him of
he was an exceptional chess player
and I beat him once
and I was really proud of that
so getting the Hayes
from him, I knew his parents
you know he had a Northern Lights
1, 2 and 3
Hayes' were the same
he numbered everything
classified those things the same
way and then made
separate crosses of them, I also got
Northern Lights number 9
from him which he never
really released in a pure form
it wasn't one of the greatest
Northern Lights but it was
unique enough to preserve
so I preserved it
and yeah if I ever released
that I'd definitely ask permission
from his family but the Neville
Hayes did have Northern Lights
in it, I mean
he crossed the Hayes with
Northern Lights and I think he told me it was
Hayes number 3
his most worked
Hayes' were 1, 2 and 3
so number 3 and I think
it was a Northern Lights number 2 that he
used to create Neville's
Hayes and he was really proud of it
and when I brought
it back
the commercial growers couldn't get enough
of it, it produced really well
indoors, it wasn't like
a normal sativa
it had plenty of
trichome production
maybe the only thing comparable at
that time was White Widow which
I know him and Scott had
some work together
on producing Shantibaba
they worked together on that
I know there was back and forth
but I never experienced that with
Neville, he was just a gentleman
to me
I went to his so called
castle and
went down and played
chess with him on the table
downstairs and
a lot like me, just
a nut about pot
at the time, I couldn't read enough
about it, I couldn't see enough
I couldn't get enough exposure
I couldn't find enough genetics
and he goes, yeah just be careful
because it's a
never ending road, he says
you go down this road
and he says it just keeps expanding in front
of you and there's really
no end to it and he was right
to this point I never thought
I would be here
even still talking to people that
were interested in pot, I thought
once it got legal, that all these strains
these old ones that I spent
all this time preserving
I would have done everything in vain because no one would want
them because they want the new shiny
next grade poly
hybrid that
shines like a diamond in comparison
to some of these old
building block strains I call them
that I've kept viable for all
these years
Yeah wow, what a really unique history
you've had with Neville, that's really cool
I'm quite envious, I'd love to ask
quickly, can you describe
that Northern Lights 9
I don't think I've ever heard anything like that
Yeah it's a
a lot like
Northern Lights number 5
but I don't think it draws anything from
Northern Lights 5
it has
narrow leaves
on the top of the plant
really broad leaves on the bottom
some of the bottom leaves
getting as big as my hand, more of an
antilining
but then when it goes into flower
most everything on top
is all narrow leaf
heavily tricone
really dense
buds
very strong
sedative stone
but uplifting at the same time like a haze
keeps you going
keeps you running all day
kind of like that Doobie Brothers
song, keeps you running
sounds like beautiful stuff
dating myself
that's really lovely to hear
ok cool
so you've spoken about
enjoying some of Neville's
works and
unfortunately our listeners won't be
able to see this because this is an
audio only podcast but
I can see sneakily in the background
there's a plant more seeds sticker
Bodhi, I'm interested
to know what other breeders
do you think are doing good work at the moment
well anybody that's
doing it for the love of the plant
is
in my opinion
and anybody that's breeding and testing their gear
is working towards
a future
in cannabis
that can only be commended
I can't
take away from anything that
anybody's doing
I've seen Bodhi's work
with some of the land races
and bringing back
some of these older strains
I do
on occasion
talk to people
and real recently even today
talk with people that are
giving him genetics to work with
or they're doing collaborations
with him
so I know that some of his genetics
or all of them
and that's kind of what I look for
it's like my model
if in doubt grow it out
so I've grown out Bodhi strains
that I'm interested in
just from people's
descriptions of the plants when they finish
I'm like oh yeah that's
you hit me right on the head
that sounds like an old school plant
I'm gonna run that
I really like what he's
doing
he's a really nice guy
probably doesn't remember me
but that's the way
I prefer it
I spent a lot of time
in the shadows
very recently
having coming out
and sharing things
I just don't want things to disappear
that's why I'm here
today I guess
yeah nice and I can
vouch for all of that
Bodhi's gotta be one of the nicest
guys you'll ever meet and I'm sure he probably
does remember you to be honest I remember thinking
that myself the first time I met him
I'm like he's never gonna remember me but that's what makes
him so magical he's so personable
you know I bet he does remember you
we talked about playing a bass
you know as one of my hobbies
that's one of the things that
I did was you know I had
friends that were musicians and we all
loved to smoke pot so we'd play
you know I had a house we all
played and there was instruments
you know in the house
and all hours of the day
people would come and crash
smoke sessions going on
all hours of the night
you know police would actually come to the door
and say you know hey the neighbors
have said this and that you wanna keep it down
or we'll bust your grow and I'm like
okay well you put it like that
but
you know music is another
thing that I kinda connect with
cause it's for a past
time if you're a grower
it's one of those things
you can stay home and do you know
you can play music and take care of your
plants you know anybody
that's farming or
growing knows that you only
have a limited amount of time that you can
go do other things other hobbies
and you know
music and musicians
I met some fantastic musicians
I met some great collectors
I met
I gave a guitar to Paul Allen
from Microsoft
met him went to his home
so music people
I knew Al Hendricks and
Leon Jimmy Hendricks' dad
and Leon his cousin
and I spent time
gigging with them on the Lions
Lair on Highway 99
in Washington State
you know to get out there
with musicians and smoke
and everybody go in the back lot
and smoke out and hey what's
this and Jesus Christ I thought this stuff
was extinct you know
and who are you
that kind of stuff
keeps you going you know and it revitalizes
you if you're plugged in to music
and you like playing music
it gets to be a passion too
he he
I'm a kindred spirit with you
I love that that's so awesome to hear
yeah links to the Hendricks
family that's pretty cool
yeah just
Al just happened
to be at the same bar we were at
and me and my friends
played Red House which is a blues
Hendricks tune that we just absolutely
loved and Leon came
up on stage and wanted to play with
us played a couple of tunes
and then we went out back and
shared some whiskey with
Al and talked about Jimmy
and yeah it was
it was a great time
and that was before you know
everybody was after Jimmy's
legacy and what
he owned and rights to music and
they are part of
the Hendricks family that was the family
and but there was
you know differences of opinion
with the sister I guess
with Leon and
Al you know was
he was Jimmy's dad he was a great
guy you know his
90% of Jimmy's upbringing
was with Al
and to just sit back I'm a
great listener I know I'm
talking a lot right now but
now's my opportunity
I listen to people more than I'll
put out because I
also want to learn I'm a great learner
and how I learn is listening
and I can gauge
what people are all about
and their passions toward things
just by listening to them
and Al's
Al Hendricks his
greatest passion was his
son Jimmy and his upbringing
a lot of people don't understand
how patriotic
Jimmy was
other than he played the Star Spangled
Banner at Woodstock
but Jimmy was a veteran of
the 101st Airborne
not an easy outfit to get into
and you know he had a
guitar the whole time he was in boot
camp and you know Al
made sure he sent him a guitar
so hearing those stories that
you hear first hand from a parent
are different than you hear
about folklore
and read from books
and stuff so that's the kind of
stuff I get from music
online I have some
crazy videos that
a buddy of mine put onto
YouTube years ago under my
alias Jaime Chiba
and you know those have come back
to haunt me
people talk
you're a lot crazier than I thought you were
and you know it's kind of just
all out there and it's a mixed
mash of some plants
and
you know Hempfest number four
my son who's
already a former Marine
he's in there as
an 18 month old child
in a stroller at
Hempfest down at Gasworks Park
Hempfest by the way
great inspiration Vivian McPeak
one of the finest people you ever
meet on the planet
my experiences with Hempfest
and all the people surrounding it
especially Jack Herrera
phenomenal
event and I think that's why
we're here today
at this point of
legalization is because of
Hempfest and
festivals like it
and I'll even include High Times
efforts
with the Cannabis Cup
and their promotion
they might have made a lot of money but
you know they stayed in business
they weathered the storms
and lawsuits
and their founder
I don't call myself a criminal I do
call myself an outlaw because that's the life
I've lived my entire life
and you had to
to be a grower
a breeder a preservationist
that's the price
you paid there wasn't
a monetary price
it was a price of
isolation and
being
anonymous always
yeah wow
what a rich life
you've led that's so cool
to hear and almost perfect timing
you throw that in because we're sort of on the tail
end of things
last question or two before we get into our quickfire
questions that we always do at the end
okay I realized
I hadn't actually asked you this yet I'm sort of kicking
myself what grow style
do you utilize are you an organics
guy are you a more salts
I'm an organic
totally organic soil
I believe in earth
boxes as a passive hydroponic
soil system organic
but using
using the earth boxes
I know they're expensive and it's a commercial
way to go
I know you can make them yourselves
nowadays but I'd purchased
so many over the years
I still use them to this day
I can walk away from a grow for up to
two days and not have to worry
about watering
with my raising
children and having
a real job in life
that was a real benefit to me
when I ended up doing everything
alone and
didn't have some of the backup
I've been really blessed
to have in my life I've had people come
and go in my life that
you know were more passionate about the
plant than just about anybody
I've ever met some of them were
in it for their own financial gain
and they did really well
but you know just for their
assistance and everything they did
to help me along the way to keep
these seeds going
I can't thank them enough
Yeah hugely hugely I
think that having the ability to run things
with a busy life is really important
and people around to help is always
very very useful
I probably should have slotted this next question
a little earlier on when we were talking about it
but we had 2 or 3 different
listeners chime in with essentially the
same question and they were wondering
have you ever grown out skunk cabbage
and do you think there's any relationship
between skunk cabbage and the roadkill
I got some skunk
cabbage seeds
from Alaska bean
brains
and they
didn't germinate
I didn't know that it kept them in a freezer
and I probably
hung on to them to drop
them into a cycle
of growth cycle
longer than I should have
because I didn't know probably that they were
frozen and so that
might have been
a reason they never germinated
Yeah
but yeah you know Alaska bean
brains great guy
I wish I had the opportunity
to finish
him out because he said it was
a great strain
I have a cover crop outside
of all my grows
is skunk cabbage
it's an actual
plant
the bears eat it, the deer eat it
it's a plant that grows
extensively
in southeast Alaska
British Columbia
up the coast of Alaska
here
That's neat, sort of like a small world
sort of thing almost, that's really cool
to hear
So, onto our quickfire questions
which is the 4 or 5 questions
we ask all of our guests at the end of the episode
and I'm always keen to hear people's answer
first one being
what is the single most memorable
cannabis experience you've ever
had
The single most memorable
experience I ever had with cannabis
was on a New Year's Eve
in
Maui, Hawaii
I walked
upstairs
it was a restaurant
bar
I walked upstairs from Front Street
in downtown Lahaina to a bar called
The Blue Max
Now, The Blue Max was
just fantastic
old school bar
open air, but the music
that came out of it just sucked me
right in
I smoked a joint with
Paco DeLucia
and
Cecilia
and Capona from Hawaii
they were there with
Al D Meola
but they had played
up at a resort
north of there
but I smoked a joint with them
and I listened to some music that they were playing
and it was
just a magical night
and I think
the pot was a catalyst
but I always
that's one of the strains
I didn't find out what it was
I always wished that I had
asked them
or found out
what the genetics were
so I could recreate that
because it was the most magical
high I've ever had in my life
I still remember it to this day
In the old Blue Max
there was couches
for seating
and you would sit like 5 feet away from the band
while they were playing
and people would be coming
streaming up the stairs
and it was just
like an out of body experience
I can't even explain it
just sitting there floating in the music
and
the great high that I had
from whatever pot that was
that I got from them
the great unknown, some of the best
are the ones that got away
I love that, that's a great story
so on the other
end of the spectrum, what was something
that you were really excited to try
maybe your friends had even
hyped it up a bit to you
and then when you finally got around to trying it
you were left feeling a little disappointed
oh man
there's a purple strain
that came out a while ago
Purple Punch
I was told that this was
the be all end all
polyhybrid that would just knock your
socks out and a friend of mine
got it from a place
in Oregon that sold clones
so it was like a certifiable
clone and you know
bought it from a legitimate breeder
so grew it out
and yeah it was a total let down
it wasn't
anything I was expecting
I'm like sorry I'm going to pass on
working with this
we've heard a few guests mention that
it certainly has the purple
but maybe not the punch
right, exactly
okay, so this is one I
really enjoy, I'm going to drop you
off on a desert island and
theoretically you can grow infinite weed
for the rest of your life but
you can only take 3 strains with you
they can be either clones or seeds
if you want to maybe do some breeding or whatever
what 3 things are you going to take
with you?
that's pretty easy
Mud Bite Delight, number 1
number 2 is a strain that I created
called Pax
which is a sativa dominant
and I created it right after the
World War 2 and
I was in a meeting in
France
all the tourists were there
to see an American heavy metal band
and Pax means
peace in French
and I took a
couple of sativas
and
a sativa hybrid
so I had some
amount of indica in there
and yeah it's definitely
a good choice for a desert island
because it's a time waster
that time is not wasted
when you're high on it
that's my best
recollection
and
Lahainaluna Puna Butter
which is a puna butter originally from
Kona
area, actually
the puna district
which is on the big island
and that particular
even today is just
just a knockout
I sourced it
in Lahaina on the streets of Lahaina
I went up to where
it was grown in the mountains
actually had a few sandalwood trees
which had become a real
rarity and I had an opportunity
to go back to Hawaii
again I went up to that
particular patch
all the evidence of growing
back then is long gone
but the sandalwood trees are nice and healthy
I had locals
ask me about their exact
location because
carvers and
I said you know
I could show you the pictures but I can't
remember I could walk back there
blindfolded probably but I'll never tell
anybody where exactly
they are
but beautiful trees
I like
I like plants and trees I got
a lot of redwoods grown in my own
yard one of them is
30 feet high and I started
it from a
seed
21 years
no 24 years ago
wow that's really neat
yeah that's cool
ok we're going to do a
remix of the last question
we're now going to
you're the captain of the boat you're dropping
someone else off on the island
and it's someone who you're not
a big fan of you know you might even
go so far as to say you don't really like them
and you get to choose
what three strains you're going to leave them
with what are you going to leave them on the
island with
you know I might straighten them out so I'll leave
them my three favorite strains
I love it maybe they'll become a better person
beautiful stuff
very diplomatic I like that a lot
we've heard some interesting answers
from that question and I like your response
a lot there so onto
our final question for the episode
if I gave you a time machine
and you could go to any place
in history geographically
any time in terms of like
chronologically where would you go
and what are you going to collect presumably
you're going to collect some seeds or a clone
or something like that where are you going to go
and what are you getting
I'm going to go back to Hawaii to the Blue Max
and I'm actually going to ask those people
the musicians I was talking
to and smoking with what that
particular strain was
it was the unanswered question of my life
I guess
I love it man that one must really
riddle you
it resonates constantly I'm like
you know of all the things that
were in Hawaii that I
went through trying to
grow and trying to find that particular
I never have found
anything close to it you know
kind of like roadkill skunk
it might be you know that
lucid unicorn
that exists in my mind
that may not exist
in a plant anymore and that
just kind of keeps me going
on the end
that what I'm doing isn't all wrong
and it's not crazy
preserving some of these strains because
maybe there's something
in my quiver
that another
person is going to find
just as enjoyable
as I did that strain
that I now don't even
know what it is anymore
yeah certainly certainly
so I think that just about brings us
to the end of things for this episode
were there any general comments
or shout outs you wanted to give
well
just if you're
growing
don't doubt what you're growing until you
grow it out and see what the
potential is
is something
isn't what you
want
don't spend too much time on it
because we all only have so much time
breed
and grow towards
what does it for you
what rings that bell for you
and you know do share
your genetics and your knowledge
with everybody else because
the future looks like
the way we've been going the last 4 years
everybody's going to need cannabis
a whole lot more than we need
it right now and it's been around
for so long thousands of years
helping and aiding
people that
the more we have and not the less we have
as far as genetic
capability
is going to be important
to everyone
if you can grow your own medicine
and be happy
and remember everybody started
out a pollen chucker there was no expert
breeders in my
opinion when I started out
there was only people making seeds
from things they got
in other regions of the world
and learning their chops
and putting the work in
and growing and breeding
and cross breeding until
you know I'm sure everybody
can agree that we've gotten a little carry
away with the polyhybrids
but if you retain
some of the good
things by searching
for the recessive traits
and the traits that you want
and get rid of the things that you don't
want you can probably
create some pretty phenomenal
polyhybrids that will
last the test of time
just my general
opinion
some very wise words there
for people looking to
make their mark lasting
and to make some cool stuff in the process
