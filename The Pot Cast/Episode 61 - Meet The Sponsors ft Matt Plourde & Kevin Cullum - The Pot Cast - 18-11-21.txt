Hello and welcome budding enthusiasts.
It's your boy Heavy Daze coming at you from the Upside Down Library.
And in this episode we're doing a meet the sponsors.
We work with some incredible sponsors who are very proud to be affiliated with and we
want you guys to hear a little more about them.
Seeds here now James Bean you've heard from him before and you'll hear again but on this
episode we're going to hear a little bit from Matt from Premiere Tech.
Talk a little bit about ProMix Connect your number one microrisal product as well as countless
other products you're probably familiar with and might already use such as their mediums.
Likewise we're going to hear from Kevin of Copert Biological Systems an IPM expert in
the field and a huge source of knowledge for any IPM questions.
I'm really excited for you guys to hear this one.
I had a lot of fun talking to everyone and I hope you guys enjoy this as much as I did.
So up first we have Matt of Premiere Tech talking all things ProMix Connect.
We're going to jump straight into this one.
Let's get into it.
The thing which I find really interesting about Premiere Tech and ProMix in general
is that for years the company has been really well known in the cannabis community for providing
really high quality mediums and when I think ProMix I think a lot of the media you guys
produce most notably that for a long time came inoculated with microrisor.
What was it that stimulated you guys to sort of start looking into microrisor and wanting
to pursue that pathway a little further?
Well like you said we're really well known in the industry by the growing media.
ProMix HP wasn't really developed for cannabis but it ended up being an amazing growing media
to grow the plant.
But we wanted to address the market more specifically so we were looking at our technology, what
is available and looking at the plant and the growth cycle and everything, how we can
contribute and seeing all the products out there we felt like we were able to bring a
high end product on the market that would help a grower grow great cannabis.
Yeah, really good answer.
It sort of stimulates me to start thinking all about microrisor myself and maybe the
best way to sort of discuss this to start at the beginning which is how do you guys
grow microrisor?
What is the process behind doing that?
Well we have a really unique process at Premier.
First it's all done in-house with our technologies but in the microrisor industry there's basically
two ways of producing microrisor fungi.
There's the first one I would say the most common and I would say the easiest in the
market is in vivo technique.
So the microrisor fungi is basically grown on a full plant that is usually grown into
an inner medium.
It could be clay or sand for example.
And then you harvest all that inner medium, the root system of the plant and the fungi
itself and that constitutes the base of the microrisor product.
But there are certainly a couple of flaws with that technique.
Yes it's less expensive but at the same time it's harder to ensure no presence of pathogen,
control the type of genetics of microrisor, you end up with a product and it's harder
to control also the concentration and the quality because you're growing it out there
on the full plant.
At the beginning like 30 years ago that's how Promethec was doing it.
But with a lot of years and research we've developed a technique which is in vitro technique.
It's kind of grown on the artificial root system of a plant in kind of a micro-reactor
if I can call it that way.
Honestly I don't even know the process at all because it's a well-guarded secret in
the industry.
It requires a special type of equipment, it's done in a laboratory with a septic condition
with a special type of expertise.
So yes it's more expensive but you're able to produce a massive amount of micro-reactivity,
enormous concentration and a very high quality product at the end.
Yes okay that makes sense.
I think I read a long time ago that some types of plants and root systems will produce micro-reactivity
naturally but it sort of like takes years.
Does that sound correct?
A plant in itself cannot grow mycorrhizae by its own.
The way it can grow mycorrhizae is because it would have like a viable spores or mycorrhizal
structure in the soil and when the symbiosis happens with the root system well the mycorrhizal
fungi are going to develop itself you know and at some point you can harvest the mycorrhizae
directly on the root system of the plant.
Okay interesting yeah because I guess my follow-up question was I was always wondering well if
you went somewhere that had like really old established mature growth like say like the
Redwood Forest in Humboldt or like you know somewhere with really established growth could
you try to harvest mycorrhizae from that soil or not really?
Yeah definitely honestly for example Primatech didn't invent mycorrhizae or anything.
Mycorrhizae was found in the woods by digging out some roots so when you have really old
you know growth operation outdoor or even in the forest or stuff like that you can definitely
find mycorrhizae in the soil for sure.
Okay sure but I mean I guess obviously it's pretty variable.
In terms of the mycorrhizal product you guys create I'm assuming that consistency is probably
some like one of the benefits you can sort of bank on when buying a high quality mycorrhizal
product like ProMix Connect sort of thing?
Yeah definitely consistency is a big thing especially for a cannabis grower you know you're
growing a high valuable plant so you want to be able to have consistency in each of the batch of
the mycorrhizae that you purchase and we've just talked about the method that we're using to
produce that mycorrhizae that ensure a very high quality product each and every time.
But not only that you know we're we test each and every batch each time and for ProMix Connect
especially it's a very small batch so we validate the number of iodized pores for each batch,
the content of heavy metal as well and also the presence of microbial for example.
So each batch of product that you can buy out there is really really high quality.
Yeah that's great to hear I mean I was sort of wondering in terms of like the viability of a
mycorrhizal product is there such a thing as like a shelf life or it's sort of indefinitely stable?
There's definitely a shelf life because you know mycorrhizae at the end of the day is a
live microorganism you know so you have to keep it viable and alive
and in order to have the benefit out of it. We have like a two years shelf life assuming that
it's keeping at the right temperature you know indoor temperature is not too hot not too cold
but yeah I would say we have a two years shelf life.
Wow that's really quite good I mean especially compared to some of the other microbial products
you get sort of more bacterially based ones that you know the shelf life is quite limited
comparatively. A question I was hoping you may be able to answer for me is I had read in the past
other mycorrhizal products there can be quite a bit of variation in terms of what the spores are
mixed with or I think I remember reading one time that mycorrhizal product I was using was it had
like azomite with the spores or something or zeolite or something like that and I guess I
was wondering is that common process and does that affect the quality of the product the substrate
it's sort of mixed or bound with? If I understand the question correctly you're talking about kind
of the formulation of the product because the thing is like mycorrhizal it's a fungi and you
can put it in different type of carrier depending on how you want to bring the fungi to the plant
so it could be like in the case of PROMIX Connect it's a wettable powder but you can it could be
granular form. Zeolite is another example of carrier that can be used and there's a lot of
different type of carrier it could be into water but it's a bit more complicated since you
have to keep in low temperature to keep the viability but you know you can formulate the
product in different ways and that's definitely something that PROMITEC has become expert at
because it's one thing to produce good mycorrhizae but you have to keep it viable until the grower
actually using your product and formulation so keeping the mycorrhizae alive on the carrier
that you're choosing is a big part of it. Yeah that is definitely something I was hoping we
could touch on a bit because something I had noticed and the reason why I stepped away from
that mycorrhizal product I referenced in the past was as you mentioned you understood perfectly what
I was trying to ask so apologies for forgetting the word carrier and whatnot but you were right
it was a granule sort of base mycorrhizal and I found it really hard to apply it to like the
root ball when I was transplanting for example like it was it would just fall off like little
grains of rock sort of thing. Would you sort of guess that the way PROMIX is made in the sense
that it's that wettable powder and you can really get a nice coating on the root ball for example
would you sort of guess that that's probably a better way of applying it than say the granules
I gave up on in the past? Yeah definitely you know in granular form it can work as well the
key here in cannabis and mycorrhizae is to have proximity between the spores and the roots you
know that's how the symbiosis is going to happen and that's why we developed PROMIX Connect as a
wettable powder it's like you just said you have the most proximity with the root you're able to
create a coating so like all the spores are really at the surface of the roots so that's how
you get I would say the fastest establishment and with that you get the best benefits out of it.
Yeah okay that makes sense that's good so in the past I had sometimes added mycorrhizae to just my
water and then watered it in do you think that that's gonna lead to sort of meaningful levels
of the spores getting to the roots or you really sort of want to do what you mentioned and have it
like proximally just really applied to the root itself if possible? I would say closest to the
root is the best you could have an impact by mixing it with water but clearly it's not efficient enough
for you know first mycorrhizae isn't soluble so you have to keep like agitation in your water in
order for the mycorrhizae to stay mixed into your water so that's first but even that the spore is
going to have to attach itself to the roots to have really an impact but probably a lot of them
are going to be washed away when you're applying your water you know so yes it could have an impact
but definitely not as much if you're applying it directly to your roots. Okay sure and is there
anything people can do that you're aware of that would increase the ability for the the spore to
successfully connect with the root like maybe like soil temperatures or like the degree of
how wet the medium is at the time is there anything you're aware of that could help them get better
benefit? I would say mostly two things the water not being too too hot or too cold you know tap
water is just fine when mixing the powder for example and the second thing would be to maybe
slow down on phosphorus for you know two weeks after application and it's kind of renowned out
there like phosphorus is not going to kill the fungi at all it's just that if you have a lot
a big amount of phosphorus is going to kind of inhibit the establishment of that symbiosis you
know so you want to give it a chance to those through those two first two weeks. Sure I mean
this is just sort of a question that's come to mind but if someone was to use mycorrhizae in a
like a more of like a hydroponic setting where they're using salt-based nutrients and they're
late in bloom and they're applying lots of phosphorus and potassium and stuff I guess by
virtue of what you just said like you're probably not going to get that much effect out of applying
mycorrhizae late in flower in that sort of situation or it's still beneficial do you think?
Well the key anyway is not to apply the product late in flower you know to have the best benefit
out of the mycorrhizae is to apply it as soon as possible so the goal we recommend to apply
you know when your clone is rooted that's one to when you do your first transplant that's one you
want to apply it because you know the establishments of the mycorrhizae in the symbiosis take take
sometimes so the sooner you do the application the better the benefits you know you're going to
have at the end so I don't see the point of doing it at the end like late flower when you're gonna
harvest you know a month from from that point. Yeah sure that makes a lot of sense so I mean
you touched on earlier how this is a high commodity crop it's a lot of value for people and
that's something I'm always trying to emphasize to people especially when people talk about
the economics of products and stuff I'm I sort of frequently try to remind them that
you know this is such a high value crop that sometimes paying for premium inputs you're
going to get a much better output and I guess in the case of mycorrhizae there's no discussion in
the community about whether it works just empirically you can see it works when you use
it it's just it's so so night and day difference but I guess I'm sort of wondering have you guys
ever looked into or sort of tried to quantify it or the benefit of using mycorrhizae because I
thought if I had to hazard a guess I'd say it probably going to get twice as much growth or
something like very dramatic increase have you guys ever looked into that sort of thing?
Yeah yeah of course one of our first single that we bring to the market is the return on investment
you know and the way we recommend to apply the product you know you you're going to kind of put
an investment between one or three dollar a plant it depends on how much powder or how you mix the
product you know but you know one or two three dollar a plant it's it's not much when for example
let's just say not not even a high a high yield increase let's just say five percent you know five
percent on a big plant it could end up to be 20 gram you know 20 gram at five ten dollar a gram
your return on investment is pretty pretty easy but not only that we've was really really important
for us to yes the yield yes yield is always important but in cannabis quality is everything
craft cannabis you know I feel it's a really growing industry and you know you get top dollars
for top flowers and by bringing yes the yield but also the quality you know increased terpene
increased cannabinoids you're able to produce consistently higher quality flowers and that
you're able to get much more out of a crop even for example if you don't have any yield increase
you're going to get better result as well. Yeah okay I mean that opens the door to sort of
discussing when might be the best time to use things in terms of getting the best return on
investment a lot of people use mycorrhiza as sort of a root stimulating agent instead of your
traditional cloning gels or powders things like that how would you use mycorrhiza would you say
for example use it once when stimulating the roots and then again when transplanting what
how would you tell if your friend came up to you and said when should I be using mycorrhiza give
me the roadmap? Well I would just tell you how I personally use it myself you know most of the
grower out there anyway are now probably doing only one transplant that's kind of the trend right now
and anyway the most important application is the first one and in my mind the best one is when you
have a rooted clone that is ready to be transplanted into a bigger pot because you know you have all
those roots exposed and you have to have the contact like I said before the roots and the
spores in order to get the symbiosis going so I would say that's really really the key moment to
apply the product. Yeah okay great and I mean this one is kind of a hard one to answer and that's
why I'm asking you because I wasn't able to find an answer but I've always been curious as to how
mycorrhiza facilitated that root stimulating process because it's very clear based on people's
evidence of just trialing it themselves that mycorrhiza is a reasonably is a pretty down
good effective rooting agent but I could never really like figure out like what was how was it
mediating this process do you have any idea about that or is that just something we probably need to
research a bit more to figure out? Well mycorrhizae mycorrhizal fungi basically need the plant
to live that's how it works you know by having that symbiosis going with the root system of a
plant and that's how the mycorrhizal fungi is able to thrive and develop itself you know create the
network that bring the benefit the renowned benefit of the mycorrhizae which is picking up
water picking up nutrients you know and in return it's going to help the plant to thrive because if
the plant thrives the fungi is going to thrive as well so if you have more water more nutrient
you're going to be able to develop bigger root a bigger structure bigger flower you know and higher
quality it's all linked together so if if the fungi is doing well well the plant is going to do
well as well so. Okay yeah that's that's a really sort of nice explanation like so
you're sort of thinking that maybe there's like a chemotaxic sort of process where the fungi are
stimulating the roots to ensure their own survival sort of thing? Well there's a whole process behind
of it you know I can go deep into each and every step you know the the spores when you get into
contact with the roots like physically it's going to detect where the roots is in the soil and it's
going to germinate towards it and at some point it's going to have a contact between the ife and
the roots the root in itself it's going to penetrate the root cells and create structure inside the
roots of the plant and when those structure like arbuscle and vesicle are created inside the root
they are able to exchange energy and that's how the ife network then is going to be created
and you know that relationship yes going to bring more water and more nutrient but you know you
impacting also the immune system of a plant you're basically stimulating the immune system of the
plant so that's kind of also where gnns of quality cannabinoids and terpenes compounds like that
came from. Yeah wow okay that's that's really good information to know so with that in mind
how there's more sort of nutrient availability with the presence of mycorrhiza would you sort of
try to angle that effect as you could get away with using less nutrients because it's more
available to the plant or would you sort of try to pile up on it and be like well let's actually
add more nutrients and try to facilitate even greater uptake? Often I try to stay away from
that topic because you know cannabis growers are really like personal in terms of using nutrients
but for sure you can slow down on nutrients because you're going to pick up more but at the
end of the day you can keep the same schedule and you're going to achieve better result as well
because it's going to maybe help you achieve better like become like more nutrient like I said
but also like avoid soil buildup and stuff like that because you're having that much nutrient
present into the soil you know. Sure so I mean the majority of our listeners as far as I'm aware
are soil-based growers but you know we like to show some love to our soilless growers from time
to time so I guess my question is as far as you're aware does mycorrhiza work equally as effective in
sort of both styles of growing? Yeah you know our mycorrhiza, Promix Cannabis, yeah of course it's
Promix, it's worked well with our growing media but it's compatible with other type of media you
know as long as you have a physical support for the roots and the fungi it is going to work you
know rockwool or cocoa it's just fine directly into soil as well of course. The only issue I
would say is pure hydroponic and to be more precise aeroponic because you don't have a physical support
to develop the root and the fungi so I'm not sure how it would work but in most cases mycorrhiza is
compatible with kind of every style of growing. Fantastic and from what I had read it sort of was
saying that ectomycorrhiza didn't really provide any benefit to cannabis does that sound right to
you? Yeah no effect at all because it's kind of just a failure because at the end of the day
the mycorrhizal fungi is not going to be able to connect with the root system because it's just not
compatible so it won't have any effect at all. Sure and I mean in the past I'd seen mycorrhizal
products which had sort of boasted being a blend of you know 6-12 different mycorrhizal
strains things like that what's your thoughts on that does it provide diversity or is it filler?
You know that's something that is really popular in the marketing the most the better but
unfortunately for mycorrhizae it's not the case you know we've did a lot of research at finding
the best strain of the best you know genetic of mycorrhizae out there which is glumus and
triradices in the PROMIX Connect you know by putting any other mycorrhizae in there you're
just introducing competition with the mycorrhizae which doesn't help the strain to thrive you know
and to put other mycorrhizae in there you have to dilute the amount of mycorrhizae that you put in
of your best strain so you know it just can't you know it doesn't work that way. Yeah brilliant I'm
glad to hear that from you because that had been my suspicion for a while I think yeah I had read
that yeah the glomerular subspecies was the sort of doing the bulk of the work so that's when I
started to wonder you know the the rest just sort of filler so I mean do you suspect that going
forward in maybe say more the long term you'll see companies all switch to just sort of providing
the one strain that's doing the bulk of the work or do you think there's still just always going to
be a bit of marketing at play? There's definitely always going to be some marketing but we have to
keep in mind that some people are just aren't able to produce a perfectly pure product you know like
I've talked earlier when you're using like in vivo technique of growing the plant it's hard to
keep control of what is actually growing on the root system of the plant so you have probably
multiple species of mycorrhizae in there so I feel like there's always going to be some product like
that out there and people that are actually able to produce a concentration of a specific species
specific species going to go that route eventually. So with that in mind are you aware of any other
microbes which may sort of synergize well or just work well in conjunction with mycorrhizae
that you're personally fond of? Yeah honestly most bacteria work really really well with
mycorrhizae that's why for example our PROMIX plus line there's mycorrhizae and
Bacillus insider green media because they work really really well together and for example if
you're already using a standalone product based which is some bacteria it's going to help
definitely because bacteria work well when you have organic surface available because they grow
on the root you know and if you have the i-finet work that is well developed well it's more surface
for your bacteria to grow so there's definitely a good synergy with most bacteria and mycorrhizae.
Yeah okay good to hear and I mean a bit earlier you mentioned how mycorrhizae sort of directly
can affect the plant's immune system through the way it connects with the roots. Something I always
try to talk to people or listeners is about how when you affect the plant's immune system
beneficially you're essentially just increasing its ability to fight off pests to fight off
pathogens things like that would you say that essentially mycorrhizae is doing that as well?
Yeah definitely you know it's a big resistant to stress you know if you're using mycorrhizae outdoor
the death rate of your crop is going to be way lower than without it because you know it's a
bigger resistant to stress and you just said it if you're able to defend yourself against pests and
stuff like that well that's translating to higher terpenes higher cannabinoids because
you know those compounding cannabis wasn't meant for for you men to get high it's a defense
mechanism from the plant so if you're able to defend yourself more easily you're not going to
produce more terpene and more cannabinoids you know. Yeah I wholeheartedly agree and I love
I love that you bring that up you know like as much as we'd like to think we're masters of the
universe this plant that's near and dear to our heart is essentially just trying to fight off some
bugs at its core. Exactly, exactly. That's good. I don't know who told me that but basically
cannabis is a sexually frustrated plant it's just trying to reproduce itself and we're not letting
it reproduce itself we don't want to have any seeds so she's just keeping on putting flowers
hoping that some pollen is going to come his way. Oh my god that's hilarious. Exactly. There you go
okay cool well I mean something I've done in the past and I'm happy to throw myself under the bus
here a little bit with this is I sort of just wanted to experiment a bit and make some weird
and wonderful microbial mixtures so I'd sort of just mix a few different microbial powders
together and then make a little slurry and apply it to the roots and just sort of see how it goes.
Have you heard anything about that working good working bad is there any mixtures you might
recommend avoiding like I guess maybe one I was thinking about initially was do you want to avoid
mixing different fungal spores together or not a real problem with that what's your take?
Like I said before I don't really consider myself to be like a grower per se so I don't have a lot
of knowledge on that subject but you know I know growers that are using you know live bed
to grow cannabis you know mixing a lot of different composed different type of microorganism
you know creating like an alive soil and I definitely see people having a lot of success
with that but if you ask in my personal opinion I just I just find that it's maybe a bit more
trouble because you're having the locks that you provide you have like an external containers you
know so you're able to control what you're providing to your plants so why putting like so
much into it and not able to manage like specifically when you you want to create you know.
Okay sure and another one I'd sort of always wondered about which I think you might be able
to answer for me is sometimes when I'd seen people making compost like mixing a bunch of amendments
like you know maybe alfalfa and kelp and a big pile and then cooking it up before they eventually
grow with it I'd seen them adding mycorrhiza at that step and just when they mix their compost
pile and then let it sit for a while and I thought did the spores just sit there stagnant waiting or
what what do you think happens there? You know we haven't made any study on that I don't think so
but personally I think that maybe there could be some effect at some point because maybe some of
the spores are going to stay dormant into the compost but at the same time there's so much heat
into it probably most of it's going to die but depending on how you proceed maybe some of the
mycorrhiza is going to stay alive and at some point if you're having there's proximity with
the root that is growing into the compost or the mix that you created there's going to be
some effect at some point. Yeah I guess that's what I sort of figured that like you're sort of
trying to prime the medium to be ready for the roots but yeah I guess that that hot composting
process might might take its toll on some of the spores. Okay well I mean on the other end of the
spectrum another thing I'd sort of wondered in a similar fashion was when people were brewing teas
or making nutrients for their plants and they might you know bubble it with an air stone for a
few days before they use it and they were throwing mycorrhiza powder into that mixture and letting it
bubble for a few days. Do you have any thoughts on that side of process? Like I said earlier it's
kind of tricky to put mycorrhizae sometime into water because water makes like chemical compound
more available for the mycorrhizae so sometime you know how mycorrhizae preserve is like the spores
are dormant you know and when you put it in contact with water they can they can come across
some chemicals that gonna you know trigger them to to germinate and when they germinate at
some point they're not gonna have any energy left to create that symbiosis. So like putting it into
water it's kind of a risky move right from the get-go but like you just mentioned there's so
much technique out there that definitely at some point some kind of effect but definitely not as
much as the classic way that we recommend like directly on the root system you know.
Okay I think I had read somewhere in the past that mycorrhizae can die after as little as say
24 hours after being put into water if it doesn't attach to a root. Does that sound like there's any
truth in that or maybe it's not quite correct? Well the first thing there's a lot of mycorrhizae
product water-based on the market and if you see a mycorrhizae product that is water-based
and that is on a shelf and not like a lower like say let's say four degrees temperature
that is what basically won't work. You know in water form it's way like I said earlier are there
to keep this viable spores dormant. So if they get activated they like I said they're eventually
going to die because they won't be able to connect with any type of roots. So it's a bit
more tricky when having a formulation water-based formulation. Yeah okay sure and I guess it probably
just varies from brand to brand as to how long the spores would be viable in that situation?
Yeah definitely and it's also dependent on the application you know if you're having a powder
form that you're mixing with water right away and you're applying directly on the roots
you won't have time to die you know because you're using the product right away. I'm more
talking into like a shelf life situation. Okay yeah no that that makes sense for sure. So a lot
of the people listening to the show utilize a style of growing called no-till where the idea is
you're trying not to disturb the soil as much as possible and just sort of taking out the stump of
the old root putting a new one in. Does that sort of environment lead to any benefits with the
mycorrhiza because the soil is sort of there long term or because the roots are in this cycle of
like being healthy and then dying off and then new roots is it sort of like you're just starting
fresh in a sense each time? If I'm understanding correctly you're meaning you're like reusing the
same soil to grow candorus right? Okay okay well if you're using mycorrhiza already and you're
keeping the roots in there there's still going to be some mycorrhiza in sport left because you
know when mycorrhiza grow on roots it creates spores and vesicles and stuff that is able to
reconnect eventually with an alive root system. But at the same time reusing your soil is always
a tricky business because you know for example you're purchasing PRO-MIX for the porosity you
know the structure of the soil that is provided and you know the stability of the pH and stuff
like that but that's something that over time you're going to lose because there's compaction
you know the fiber of the peat is going to get degraded all of those stuff that's going to come
into play as well. Okay sure yeah so I guess it sort of would be a bit of a challenging undertaking
for someone to try to like reuse the same pot just again and again again just to try to like get their
own mycorrhiza right? Yes and no like I mean I'm maybe more talking into like a commercial business
type of thing but if you're like trying some stuff at home like craft cannabis and trying
new things there's you know you can try whatever you want and see how it goes. I've seen people
doing so much different things and having success you know it's not because personally me I'm not
doing it that is not good but I see it may be difficult to do it like you know commercial
scales but you know if you're growing for fun at home definitely you can try it. Something I had
always wondered was you often hear about foods for microbes be it bacterial or fungal is there any
food you can give to help make your mycorrhiza more happy so to speak? Not really I would because
you know bacillus and bacteria are able to like get their food or their nutrients in the soil
you know so that would be for bacteria like yeah you can apply some stuff that will help
their development but you know to develop itself mycorrhizae just need the plant that's what they
get their nutrient their energy from the plant so even if you are adding any type of you know sugar
or stuff into your your growing media if it benefits the mycorrhizae it's because it's going to benefit
the plant and not directly the mycorrhizae. Yeah okay I mean that's sort of in line with the
principle organic growers use anyway feeding the soil not the plants I guess it's the same with the
mycorrhizae. Yeah exactly. As far as you're aware are there any factors which can improve the
efficiency of the mycorrhizae once it's been applied to the plant? Well we touched point on
that earlier but I definitely like the amount of phosphorous that you're applying right after it
I would say like to low down below 20 ppm would be like a recommendation to ensure that the symbiosis
get going more easily and faster. Yeah okay sure I guess I'm sort of thinking like do mycorrhizae
favor any particular medium composition over others or it's all pretty much effective of similar
proportion no matter what medium you're in? To be totally honest with you I feel like it's
going to work well in any type of environment because you know mycorrhizae also renowned to
help the structure of the soil it's such a small structure that pretty much any type of soil that
it's in is going to thrive and develop itself really easily you know compaction is not really
an obstacle for mycorrhizae so I would say it's going to thrive in pretty much all those environments.
Okay sure I've been doing a lot of reading about the PROMIX Connect product and I guess I'm sort
of wondering are there any specifics about it or the production methods which you feel help set it
apart from others? Well we've talked earlier about the Promethex you know using an in vitro technique
which is a big part of our success you know we're in the house producing our mycorrhizae having full
control of all the process from A to Z you know a lot of brands out there are co-packing that are
actually purchasing mycorrhizae and just putting in a bag so of course you don't have the same
control as we have you know we've been doing that for so long now that we're really expert into not
only producing mycorrhizae but formulating mycorrhizae and not only that but PROMIX Connect
has been developed exclusively with cannabis in mind and you know when you deal with microbes and
alive microorganisms the first thing is it needs to be viable they need to be alive and that's
something that we guarantee we have 6,000 viable spores inside our product so there's nothing
dead in there so you know what you're paying for and after that we guarantee the concentration
6,000 viable spores is by far the most concentrated product out there there's not even
someone that is coming close so having a higher concentration you know you have a better chance
to get the symbiosis established quickly so better benefit at the end as well and the last thing
we've developed it as a way to ball potter because cannabis is such a short crop you know you want
the symbiosis to get going fast so you have a concentrated product that it's a alive and close
to the root system as a way to ball potter. Yeah okay I think in the past I had read some sort of
different units used and I think it might have been like BTU or something like that and
they're talking in the billions or the thousands are there different sort of units used to sort of
measure the activity of the product or it's all standardized in like the spore count?
I would like it to be standardized but it really isn't most mycorrhizae product out there are
listed as propagal which isn't necessarily a bad thing propagals is a real term you know
but proper propagals stand for any part of the fungi that may connect with the root system
eventually but at the same time that could be a knife feed it could be a root fragment with some
physical you know it could be an unviable spores and all of that is counted into the concentration
of the product but at the end of the day none of those structures going to have an impact on
on the plant only viable spores are able to efficiently colonize the roots so that's why
we don't even count those in Prometheus Connect it's strictly 6,000 viable spores and you can
often see product out there let's say for example 500 propagals per gram but at the end of the day
you end up having like 50, 10 viable spores inside per gram so you know we would like to
get more education out there about mycorrhizae you know viable spores versus propagals
because definitely it make a big difference between two products.
Yeah I guess if someone had used mycorrhizae in the past and they hadn't felt like they got
particularly good benefit from it maybe they just need to try again with something with a bit more
guaranteed activity in the box you think? Yeah definitely you know there's a lot of product out
there I don't want to do any name drop or anything but you know the viability of the product it just
isn't there each and every year Prometheus we test every product on the market and you know
the viability of the product is just everywhere all over the place it's really rare that a product
came up with the same claim as it says on the packaging so I would definitely say to try
you know a product that guaranteed the viability of their spores. Yeah okay good stuff good stuff
so I mean I guess I'm wondering if you were trying to sort of describe to someone mycorrhizae who
you know not so familiar with the ins and outs of it and they're just sort of looking for the
major points how would you describe the major benefits of using it? You know it's all linked
together of course because you know you're having you pick up nutrients and more water more easily
but all the benefits we're basically putting them in four categories it would be like healthier
and enhanced root system first you know because having that iFINET work helping the root system
you're able to have like a bigger root mass you know a bigger nicest establishment of your root
system and then you go at faster growth and you know it make only sense since you pick it up
nutrient and water easier you're going to be able to put more mass quickly and that's it's kind of
a big deal because being able to put more mass quickly you're able sometime to shove a couple
of days of veg which in a commercial standpoint is a really really useful useful thing. After that
I would say of course the increased crop yield you're able to have a bigger structure
and be most more energy available you're able to produce you know a bigger flower at the end
and the last thing and in my mind the most important is is higher quality consistently
we've tested our your terpenes content and and um and cannabinoids. Yeah some really strong selling
points there though I think a lot of people who listen to this show are probably already
quite avid fans of Mycorrhiza so it's now just time to get onto the PRO-MIX train and see what
benefits it has in store. Something I was wondering given you guys are now doing the PRO-MIX Connect is
what is the the future of Premier Tech? Are there any sort of fields you guys are thinking about
expanding into or is there a further step with the Mycorrhiza products you want to go in?
Where do you see yourself where do you see the company going in the future?
Well you know I would like to elaborate on that but of course I cannot you know tell too much
about it but I you know Premier Tech has always been a company about innovation and research so
I can definitely tell you that we're always working on something and I can tell you that
we're specifically working on something on cannabis. We have a lot of technologies available that
eventually we'll be able to maybe bring to the market so we're definitely working on some stuff
and I'm hoping to bring them to the market as soon as possible you know.
Exciting we'll have to keep our eyes open for that one I mean probably not going to be too hard
for people but where can people find PRO-MIX Connect if they're looking to give it a try?
I can probably provide you with the link we have a landing page about the Connect
where it's listed all the address where it is available and we're also online with
Indoor Growing Canada which is available all across Canada as well and probably in the US
in the next couple of weeks so yeah pretty much available all across North America.
Ah fantastic and I mean long term do you expect that people will probably be able to find it in
their sort of local grocery store or their best bet is just to go online get it shipped directly
to them? It depends on your habits we're definitely not taking the agro store out
we're we want to cater the agro store space because we still believe that it's a strong
space to be in but of course with everything that happened in the last year you know e-commerce has
come a long way so you know we're gonna try to be available on that space as well. Sure and I mean
for the people who like to go to the face-to-face events when they resume back up do you guys have
stalls there can people come and ask you questions things like that? You know we're gonna start to
get more and more out there you know the world's kind of starting again so we're at a lot of
shows throughout the years we're gonna you know be out there interacting with people so
yes I cannot in the top of my head tell you all the shows that we're gonna be in
but definitely we're gonna be out there. Yeah now that's good to hear hopefully people can
catch you at some of the shows and one of the final questions I have for you is some of our
listeners operate bigger size facilities and sort of you know have those more serious operations
do you guys provide different sizing are there sort of bigger bundles available to people if
they're looking to get like you know a sort of substantially bigger size? The biggest size that
we have available is 2.5 kilogram which three they're around 700 plan depending on how you use
it so that's our biggest packaging but of course it's easier to go into like a bigger
format for like let's say a big big big customer so we're open to maybe having something bigger
eventually. So sort of in line with that topic we were talking about earlier where you know some
products advertise in different units and they're different sizes and different prices and it can
become quite complex quite quickly do you feel that there's an easy way to sort of judge what
is bringing value in terms of a mycorrhizal product? Yeah of course that you know there's
a lot of product out there so it's come confusing like very quickly but the thing that you need to
look at basically is the number of valuable spores you know because a lot of people out there are
shopping a price for a weight but at the end of the day you're not paying for a carrier you don't
want to pay for clay you're paying for mycorrhizae and what bring value to the mycorrhizae is the
number of valuable spores so yeah some product like PROMIX Connect we know it we're a high-end
product of course but at 6,000 viable spores when you take it into account we're kind of the most
affordable mycorrhizae product out there based on the concentration. Yeah that makes total sense and
I think that's just about everything I had to ask you Matt thanks so much for coming on the show
were there any comments shout outs anything you wanted to say? You know we're trying to get more
and more involved with the community on our Instagram so come and interact with us on PROMIX
Cannabis and also myself on PROMIX Matt you know you are welcome to hit me on my DMs anytime so
yeah that's pretty much it. Amazing you know and thank you so much to both yourself and everyone
at PROMIX who's on board with helping support the show you know we really appreciate you guys
being able to help us make the shows happen and it was fantastic to have you on and get a rundown
about all the ins and outs of PROMIX Connect. Well I had a blast on your show and thank you
for having me maybe I'm gonna come back at some point. What do you think guys some awesome
mycorrhizae knowledge there from Matt at PROMIOTEK thanks so much again Matt. Up next we have Kevin
of Copert Biological Systems very grateful to have him on the show let's jump straight into it gang
Alrighty so a huge shout out and welcome to one of the IPM specialists from Copert
Biological Systems thank you so much Kevin for taking the time to join me today and to talk
all things IPM. Oh thanks for having me man. Not a problem at all how you doing today?
I'm doing good. That's good to hear that's good to hear so to start out I was hoping you might
be able to give me a little bit of background on yourself and how you ended up coming to work
with Copert. I've always actually kind of grown I grew up in the greenhouse industry like in the
commercial I originally was from the commercial ornamental industry I worked there since I was
like 15 and that's all I ever did I went to school for and then I used to be a grower at a big
commercial greenhouse and then I moved into some other aspects of it and then I ended up at Copert
about 15 years ago and they were kind of always around in the industry they're you know back in
the day they weren't quite as prevalent because bio controls weren't as commonly used but yeah
when it started to take off and it was always something that interested me so I switched over to
to working here. Wow that's a that's a cool little story I mean it must have been an interesting
journey to sort of transition from you know like a non-cannabis related horticultural field to sort
of being more in the in the active scene of the the cannabis related field. Have you enjoyed that
so far? Yeah like just to be clear I kind of grew up around both things I was always kind of involved
in the cannabis industry at the same time but back in the I was kind of involved in the early days in
the medical scene in Canada and I used to work I used to be the cultivation writer for
Cannabis Culture Magazine but this is back in like the 90s and then that kind of had an equal
footing both in the commercial greenhouse part and the cannabis part as well.
Yeah awesome okay yeah so quite a quite a depth of experience you've already got under your belt.
So one of the things I wanted to sort of start out chatting with or the place I wanted to start
our discussion was sort of the utility and the benefits of predator mites. It's been something
which for example in Australia has only recently sort of come to light whereas I'm sure in places
like Canada and America where the technology has been established there a bit longer probably more
aware of it and whatnot but I guess something I'd love to talk about starting out is how would you
describe predator mites and what would be sort of a sales pitch for someone who's a bit on the fence
and not quite sure how to use them or what they're used for? Yeah I think the first thing is that I
think maybe what people don't realize is how long they've actually been used for so everyone a lot
of the people in the cannabis industry they kind of seem to think that it's like this new thing
when cannabis started but it's really been going on like since the 80s at least in commercial
vegetables. It wasn't in ornamentals up until somewhat more recent but it was always just not
an organic vegetable it isn't like conventional vegetables it's always been a standard and in the
last like I said I've been here 15 years and probably most of the time I've been here it was
also ornamentals that became a standard so cannabis is kind of the last thing so it's a very well-proven
strategy and most of our customers like I said a lot of people think that biocontrols is something
that it's like a cosmetic type of thing or makes you feel good that you're doing it but most of
our customers are actually like conventional egg that they're not organic or anything they just use
it because it's actually a really good cost-effective solution but they use it in combination
with you know pesticides or other strategies. That's a really brilliant point the utility
of predators across multiple different systems. I guess a lot of people who follow the organic
principles of growing are generally sort of interested in this sort of holistic style of
management and whatnot. How best should people apply predator mites? I've always
sort of advocated to people that you know if you imagine you're a city and your city's under attack
you kind of want to have the army already there ready to go to help defend you rather than having
to muster it up once you're under attack and you know everything's on fire and it's a bit of an
issue. Do you agree with that? Do you think people should sort of prophylactically be using predator
mites to help mitigate any potential issues or do you more advocate to use them when required?
Definitely proactively but you can also use them like curatively so I'd say the real answer is it's
a combination you want to have them in the crop but you usually need to kind of switch gears into
different predator mites when you get a situation. So for instance like kind of a standard in cannabis
is generally people are picking kind of a generalist predator as kind of like their base
so that would be typically swarski or kookamaris and that's a predator mite that
it's a generalist where it can eat a lot of different stuff but it's primarily focused
like it's preference is thrips which is generally on cannabis kind of the main
pest so you're kind of working from that and then you stack other stuff on top if you have the issue
so sorry they would swarski or kookamaris would kind of be the base and then if you're in a garden
that you know consistently has like spider mite problems that you're expecting then we would put
in spy cow which is the tree name but it's californicus and that's kind of for spider
mites at like a preventative level but then for instance if you get spider mites kind of raging a
little bit you need to move over to spidex which is persimilis so they've all got kind of their own
little niche so a lot of it's about starting off preventatively and stacking them accordingly
yeah that's a that's a great point you make there and it sort of segues into the next question i had
for you which was that if you look on the website there's really nice information about the different
predators what they can be used to combat a whole bunch of interesting and wonderful extra bits of
information and something i noticed which you sort of just touched on is that there can be a bit of
overlap you know you read different predators and maybe a commonality between a few different
ones you read about is that they're all good for aphids for example so my question would be how
would you go about selecting the product to use if you're seeing a few of them that all
covering aphids for example are you safe with any of them is there a way in which you might figure
out one maybe out edges the others a little better for your situation how would you go about choosing
that so when you get into aphids in particular that's probably for sure the most tricky one when
it comes to anything especially cannabis because that's one that they're the controls are very like
the predators are very specific to the type of aphid so the absolute first thing you need to do
is actually id what type of aphid you're dealing with most of the time and i'll tell you there's a
couple of caveats it's a big box the aphid control thing so if you're using parasitoids
which is kind of our usually our standard approach on most crops so a parasitoid
is like a wasp not like a wasp that stings you just a parasitic wasp like kind of maybe as big
as a mosquito or something and what it does is it's really good at searching the crops it'll fly
the crop and it's smelling out aphids and when it finds an aphid it lays its egg in the aphid and
what makes what's called a mummy so and then instead of the aphid so the aphid slowly dies
the parasite takes over and at the end another parasite hatches that as the aphid so that's
usually our standard because it's a really nice thing to keep going in your crop because you only
just you know for every one aphid you know for one biocontrol you put out there i'm just making
up a number i don't know how many is but let's say it's 40 aphids that it parasitizes so for every
one aphid you put in you're actually getting 40 back you know the first two weeks later and then
all of those go and lay eggs themselves so it really builds an army in the crop so for that
those parasites are very specific so for instance if you're dealing with like cannabis aphid the one
this kind of three main parasitoids and we found one of them works a lot better on cannabis aphid
once it's called the aphipar m which is the aphidius matricaria or v works as well fairly
well and then um kolmani doesn't work kolmani is another parasitic wasp doesn't work hardly at all
um so you really have to be very specific because if you go at it with the wrong parasitoid it'll
literally do nothing so we kind of go at it from a couple of approaches so that's the parasitic
wasp is kind of the more traditional approach and then you've got like a completely different
approach which would be more like a predator bug so that's what when people think about lady bugs
that's what a lady bug is just like actually eating the the aphid and we don't use the lady
bugs too much but we use a lot of lace wings in cannabis um so the you know the advantage on
cannabis i guess in some situations is that the lace wings are eating a they're eating
indiscriminately so you don't have to id the aphid anymore it's just going to eat whatever it sees
and it also doesn't leave aphids in the crop which sometimes parasitoids because they're
leaving that little you know a zombie mummy is still there you can get some crop contamination
potentially so the lace wing is just eating it completely you don't have to worry about id'ing it
but the downside is in order for a lace wing to reproduce where a parasitic wasp only needs one
aphid a lace wing needs again making them i'm not i don't have all these numbers memorized but let's
say it needs to eat 20 aphids to get enough protein to reproduce so a lot of the time it's
not getting 20 aphids so it's it's not really reproducing so you're just kind of putting it
out almost like a pesticide you put it out it crawls around eats a bunch of aphids and then it
dies so it's still saying no matter what you're always really the most important thing of aphid
control is id'ing the aphid and a lot of times from that you really need to talk to an expert
like a biocontrol company or somebody like that that can an entomologist that can actually say
no that's cannabis aphid or whatever that's always like the first step in most pest control make sure
you actually know what you're dealing with yeah brilliant answer and you you sort of raised two
really good avenues i'd love to pursue a little more i mean just on the end there you mentioned
the cannabis aphid which some people probably be aware of but yeah over the past few years
we've seen the emergence of this new sort of aphid which seems specific for cannabis i guess
the question is do you think that it's inevitable as a cannabis community so to speak that it's
going to sort of inadvertently cause the development of new and resistant bugs over time yeah i mean
that's an interesting one because like i said i've been around the like cannabis industry for like 30
years and that really appeared in canada exactly when we legalized and the difference was there
i'm sure it was around but i mean it's really just spread almost 100 just by trading of cuttings and
i think it just wasn't that kind of trade in the old black market days of vegetative material like
it was traded amongst like crews and stuff like that you know like groups but they wasn't traded
like wide scale and that's what we saw as soon as you know that lp market got established in canada
it just both cannabis aphid and root aphid just blew up and almost i would i honestly never even
heard of it before probably i don't know whenever that happened seven years ago or something and now
it's probably one of the biggest pests in canada so i think the opening of markets really can be a
big vector for that because a lot of these are you've seen the same thing with the hops latent
virus where um you know it's really just everywhere and now it's another one that
probably barely existed before because there wasn't that much treating of clones back in the old days
yeah that certainly makes sense i mean just to take one more step maybe towards sort of the more
you know quote conspiracy theory stuff i remember in the past i used to read people talking about how
they used to think that the u.s government was releasing mites on the side of the road and stuff
to combat sort of vegetative growth and i always thought that sounded a bit far-fetched and then i
found a document one day which said like maybe they're actually doing that and that's contributed
to like these mites getting then on cannabis plants and things like that have you ever heard
or read anything like that i have and it i would say it's probably not as crazy as it sounds because
having grown up in like the 1980s i remember like i've never seen anything to say that was the case
and i personally lean away from that being the case but i mean if you were around back in the 80s
or i think it was early 90s i mean the dea 100 was releasing fusarium into cannabis crops in other
countries i think there's a fair bit of evidence they probably released it into humboldt like in
the you know concentrated cannabis areas so i mean it's not unheard of like that that for sure using
you know introducing pests or diseases to control cannabis is a real thing like that's 100
verifiable the dea did do that if you look both for cannabis and cocaine you can look if you google
if anyone wants to google that i mean there's a ton of evidence that that happened down in columbia
and elsewhere um the rest of them so i mean could they do something like that i personally doubt it
because i mean at the time it wasn't really something like a russet mite wasn't really
something that was likely to spread like that especially back in the black market days because
i said people just weren't the only way you're going to really spread that around is by trading
cuttings and uh i personally doubt it i think it's probably like most crops crop pests where
if i had to look into russet mite it seems like it kind of emerged probably out of california
i know there's a lot of that similar type of mite on uh you know and when we're talking about
hemp russet mite that's for sure a real thing whether that's the majority of what we're seeing
nobody knows because that's that type of mite is called a tersonamide mite and it's like a cyclamen
mite a broad mite they're all in that type of class tiny little mite nobody knows that much
about them so for sure hemp russet mite is a real thing whether that is 100 of all that type of
mites we see on cannabis or one percent i don't think anybody really knows so if it was hemp russet
mite i would assume it must have had to come from hemp at some point i don't know the details but
if it's some of those other ones it could have come from like for instance grapes where they
get a lot of that or fruit crops where they get a lot of that type of tersonamide mite you know
and what happens is that i know this is from where i live is there's a lot of it's a really intensive
agriculture so you'll get like let's say corn growing right beside a greenhouse that's full
of tomatoes and there'll be one test on the corn that never and this is because even though the
corn's only you know 10 feet away from the tomatoes they've got they don't the thrips
that's on the corn isn't on the tomatoes but eventually sometimes that jumps so what will
happen is you know one thrips will just be a little bit more genetically adapted to tomatoes
you know when you're you know there's a bazillion thrips landing on those tomatoes from the corn
every year sooner or later you get a couple that are more genetically adapted to that crop they
start reproducing and bang all of a sudden i've seen that we got a tomato thrips in my town so i
think it's more likely something like that where you know some guy was you know growing og beside a
vineyard and and got some mites in from there but i mean who knows never underestimate the dea
no that's that's some good insight i like that explanation it's probably yeah some sort of blend
of the two just to jump back to something you mentioned earlier when i first heard about
predators i remember in every conversation i had people were just like ladybugs ladybugs ladybugs
and i guess as time's gone by i've sort of heard less and less about them i also remember that
pragmantuses were like also you know in that uh top tier echelon of predators with ladybugs
my question is in reality do these predators provide you know really effective cover that
people talk about because i think when you look up online you know the little tables which show
you you know what bugs get eaten by what ladybugs and praying mantises are often toted as you know
they'll eat everything they're just like the cure all do you think that's maybe not quite the reality
of the situation um yeah so praying mantises i would just you can flat out say they're really
not a tool they're a cool thing if you just want to be a praying mantis wandering around in your
garden and it will eat some pests other than that i would say as far as i would be aware it has
absolutely no place in your garden um the reason for praying mantis is pretty simple so it's a lot
of what goes on with biocontrol is how what the numeric response is to the pest so how quickly
that biocontrol reaper because a lot of the control isn't coming necessarily from
your releasing it's coming from what you release building up in the crop like reproducing so
something like for instance let's say let's say spider mites so if you were to use persimilis
which is kind of the main thing that people use for spider mite i think the life cycle reproduction
is like seven days or something like that so every seven days you're getting a whole new round of
persimilis in your crop well praying mantis i believe it's like once a year maybe it's twice
a year i don't know i don't know so really what you're getting is just that one praying mantis
you put in so that's kind of one of the things that people really miss when it comes to that
stuff and then ladybugs is a little bit more complicated where i think ladybugs is unfortunately
the first thing people think of when they think about biocontrol and it is really one of the least
like outside of the cannabis industry ladybugs basically aren't even talked about they're almost
a non-issue and that's kind of for a different reason so again we go back to people are saying
oh they're great they're generalists but that's a lot of the time what you don't really want what
you need is like something that's just focused on eating your pests that you have otherwise you can
get weird stuff like i've actually seen this for instance on some other things once with one of
the predatory mice that was a kind of a generalist sometimes they've got prey preferences so we for
instance put something in for thrips and there was also whitefly and it just really liked eating
whitefly and the thrips went from almost no thrips to taking down the crop while this predator was
busy eating whitefly it doesn't happen all the time but that's kind of like when you're talking
about ladybugs you never know really what they're gonna do but mostly ladybugs they're they're they
are a generalist but mostly they're focused on aphids so where that um where they're typically
used again again none of this is really new right we've been using bio control on vegetable crops for
a long long long time as a standard so it's very dialed in like which bios have which place in the
program so where ladybugs are traditionally used like their strength is they're really good at like
cleaning up a nasty hot spot so we would for instance have these them a lot in peppers or not
a lot but sometimes um so peppers you would use parasitic wasps generally to control your aphids
that's kind of like your first plan um because like i said before because they're late you know
you only need one aphid to reproduce so they're really good for cycling themselves in the crop so
they don't have to keep introducing them so we kind of use that then we use something called uh
aphid end which is like a gall midge so that kind of is more for working more on hot spots so how a
gall midge works is it will instead of laying its eggs in the in the pest like a parasitic wasp will
it lays its eggs underneath it so what it'll do is find a real nasty hot spot lay a bunch of eggs in
the hot spot and then it's the larval stage that eats the aphids so it's kind of a bit better in
hot spots so it's kind of our backbone of the program is the parasitic wasp so if you're talking
cannabis it would probably be um aphid bar m so aphidius matricaria and then in some situations
we might use um aphid elites and then if you had a hot spot you would use something like we usually
use lacewings but you could also use ladybugs just to clean up that hot spot which would be a very
small amount because the the where where ladybugs outshine some of the other biocontrols is for
instance aphids they poop out like a honeydew so when they're eating all the plant they they're
constantly excreting this kind of sticky substance um which is just their excrement and that kind of
if you ever see like a nasty aphid spot the whole plant will kind of glisten and it's this
honeydew that they're secreting well that honeydew a lot of the biocontrols don't like because they've
got to like they get it on them and they got to spend all their time cleaning the honeydew off
instead of actually cleaning up your pests but ladybugs and others and lacewings they like it
like they just get right in there so other biocontrols don't really get into those really
nasty hot spots but ladybugs or lacewings do so that's kind of your place but for the average
like honestly if i was a commercial cannabis place i honestly wouldn't even use them like not
that's that's little how little i think they actually have a place no what a brilliant explanation
you've helped me to sort of piece together many of the little thoughts i've had about ladybugs
over the years so that that's great thank you so much and sort of another topic which i often hear
raised in the discussion of ipm is that it's often only regularly discussed by the people i talk to
who are sort of indoor but now that there's a much bigger growing market of people who are able to
venture into the outdoor because of changing legalities in their local areas things like that
i guess it sort of raises the question of how do you make selections between the use of predators
in indoor versus outdoor and i guess the primary aspect i'm interested in is that whenever i talk
to people about using it in outdoors there's sort of this perception that the bugs will just disappear
into the local environment whereas indoor you know like it's in a tent and they're going to stay
there so to speak do you think that's a bit of a misconception are you able to effectively use
predators outdoors um it's not a misconception it's not entirely true so the so basically it
depends on which predator you're using so if any of the predator mites you can definitely use them
outdoors um they've been used um like i said one of our some of our largest you know business
through our time has been um in outdoor strawberries like in california and florida that's been standard
for decades using predator mites outdoors for broad might and spider mite control so predator
mites they can't fly right so they're stuck wherever you put them so you might have a predator
mite that doesn't like the environment and doesn't do very well in it but generally if you put a
predator mite that does well in that environment um they do fine they're not going anywhere you
don't need to worry about that so that's definitely not true when it comes to predator which you could
use them exactly how you're going to use them indoors and if the environment is correct for
them they're fine when you get into some of the flying um predators then that's a very different
story which i would say nobody anyone that tells you they know exactly what the answer is to that
i would say they're probably full of it um so there's a there's a lot of stuff going on out
there so how a lot of predators um like parasitic wasps and stuff work is they actually smell
um when pet when plants are under attack they actually kind of let off like a
pheromone type of thing so there's like a scent plume coming from um let's say you got a haze
plant that's got whatever aphids or spider mites it's letting off a plume of this like alarm scent
um which is there to attract um predators and some predators are very tuned to that so they will
you know follow that plume which can travel for really a long way and that's how they find the
pests that they need to feed on so the problem is when you're going outside let's say you know
you've got an aphid you're releasing something for aphids well are they attracted to you know
they might get distracted by you know the scent plume coming from a tree in the nearby field
or maybe not like if it so nobody really knows like i've definitely seen outdoors in in cannabis
and other crops where that type of stuff did work i think it's just it's kind of hit or miss you
really don't know so you could release something that's going to fly into an aphid spot and then
they're you know just spreading around your crop or they might like some other aphid species it's
just a really they might like some other aphid species on a different crop better it's just a
really complex subject that i don't think anybody really knows so the other thing with outdoors is
the pest dynamic is very different at least in canada so we really don't have any of the pests
that we're dealing with like thrips really haven't proven to be an issue outdoors i haven't really
seen spider mites be an issue outdoors i think they could be in some environments when it's
where it's drier maybe i've seen a little bit of rust it might but basically a lot of the pest
dynamic there's just completely different than what like there's not necessarily a biocontrol
solution so the main thing that we've been doing on outdoor cannabis is actually
lace wings because the other thing you get into outdoors it's a lot lower value crop
in especially in canada most of this is going into the extract market so first of all they've
got a higher tolerance for pest levels because they're just turning into isolate or something
and you also get natural predators are coming in too right so out there the kind of strategy
that we've seen is like the biggest issue that we've seen that we actually have a solution for
is cannabis aphid and usually that's a self-induced condition where people have had cannabis aphid on
their clones that they put in that they had inside and then they put them outside and big surprise
you know you got cannabis aphid outside so what we've kind of been doing is feeding with lace
wing eggs so lace wing eggs are kind of an inexpensive version of lace wings and we kind of
feed the whole crop a couple of times with lace wing eggs with the idea that even though lace
wings are probably going to show up naturally outdoors they might not show up until like
august where we can put them in june 1st and then they start cycling in the crop earlier and that
seems to be i mean it makes sense from a science level and it seems to have worked but a lot of
the outdoor stuff on cannabis is really it's uncharted territory yeah fantastic response and
yeah it seems like a good way to sort of um you know control aphid problems outside it makes me
think you know there's so many different types of predators and there's many different formulation
types be it you know sometimes it's you know maybe predators spread amongst vermiculite i've
had predators arrive that are sort of on actively on the leaves of another product and ready to jump
on to your crop things like that you get sachets how do you know what's the best one for you in any
given situation um best one and for most situations is usually sachets so the sachets are kind of like
the evolution i think a lot of people don't credit like the evolution of biocontrols it all kind of
started off on bean leaves for instance that that person for instance persimilis so persimilis
started off by being reared on bean leaves and people would sell you know you get a bean leaf
with some persimilis on it it's also usually got some spider mites on it because by default you
have to have spider mites there and sometimes some other pests so then from there that evolved into
um having whole greenhouses where they would rear a crop it's usually done on bean plants
and then they would have infested with spider mites then they would infest that with persimilis
and then there's a special extraction technique where you can basically vacuum
off the just the persimilis and leave the spider mites behind so and then the latest technology
which which we've just developed this year is rearing it on a fictitious host so something
other than fictitious host just means something other than its natural prey source so we just
figured out that this year is how to do that so then you don't have any risk of introducing spider
mites you it's a lot more standardized production and you can actually get better results because
you can ship them with food so they've got a higher effigantity which means they can lay more
eggs in your crop so anytime when you're buying stuff on bean leaves you're like going back a
couple of decades so kind of the evolution was bean leaves with on the in the case of persimilis
or other stuff would have been for other types of mites like for instance kookamaris or swarski
they're californicas they're reared on a fictitious host so it's usually a bran mite which is kind of
like a mite that feeds on bran and basically they're reared in climate rooms with bran then
the bran mite that's eating the bran and then the swarski or the kookamaris is eating the feeder
mite so kind of the first you know wave of biocontrol was just selling that loose so you'd
buy the bran with the feeder mite and the swarski on it the vermiculite they're talking was actually
evolved from that so vermiculite was a way to get rid of the feeder mites so some crops are
really sensitive to those feeder mites they can damage certain crops so they would filter the
feeder mites out and put them on vermiculite so there was no food source for the feeder so that's
really the only reason to use something on vermiculite for predator mites it's different
with other with other bios would be if you've got a crop that's sensitive to feeder mites which
cannabis isn't and we don't even use that type of feeder mite that causes damage anymore
or for ornamentals where you don't want the carrier like let's say you're growing poinsettias
or cannabis would be the same you let's say you're putting a loose application of bran on your
cannabis and then maybe you're doing a foliar spray well that sticks that bran like glue to
your leaf or your bud or whatever and then a lot of times it molds and it's like a contamination
issue so it was traditionally ornamental growers would use that vermiculite product so it didn't
stick to the plant so then the final evolution was these sachets so what a sachet is it's basically
taking that breeding system the bran the bran mites and the feeder and the actual predator
mite you want and putting it into basically a little envelope that kind of keeps the humidity
up in it so it keeps like a breeding system going so um your rather than if you put loose material
in your crop you're just getting whatever was in that bottle and then whatever reproduces in the
crop with sachets it's releasing like for instance the regular sachets that we would use in cannabis
they usually last about four weeks so they're constantly releasing predator mites into the crop
so that's for sure always the vast majority of cases sachets are hands down the better way to
go you don't get contamination of material into your crop because it's contained in the sachet
it's far cheaper because it's breeding it itself and you're just getting a continued release
and the other reason is what specifically on cannabis why the sachets are really a good
idea is because in order for predator mites to reproduce they lay their eggs on specialized
plant hair so kind of like a trichome um and people with cannabis probably don't know exactly
what I'm talking about because cannabis doesn't really have the type of trichome that they like
so imagine you know a cannabis that's got like the glandular stocked trichome and then I think
they're called capitate sessile ones which is just like kind of like a little hair so they
like to lay their eggs on something similar to like a capitate sessile trichome it's just like a thin
plant hair and cannabis doesn't really have a lot of them it's like they're very specific about the
size and everything so I wouldn't say you don't get any reproduction on cannabis but you get
really low compared to a lot of plants like a swarski or a cucumaris will reproduce way better
on like a cucumber plant or a pepper plant than it will on cannabis so because it's not really
reproducing that well you really want to be having a constant source of them releasing into your crop
so that's where the sachets really are to me a hands down because you hang them in your crop once
they're giving you continual release into the crop for four weeks. Wow yeah really comprehensive
answer and you touched on a few things I'd love to segue into so that that's perfect and
you know sort of using the the sachet innovation as a springboard something else I noticed that
you guys are doing really well which I haven't really seen many other places in terms of
innovation is the the feeding sachets and I had a few questions around them I guess most notably
you know sort of at the forefront of my mind is are these feeding sachets sort of something to
help you bridge the current predator army you've got to say you know a few weeks ahead or are they
able to be used sort of indefinitely and if someone had purchased you know a reasonable
size amount of predators they might be able to sustain a pretty good percentage of that
population over the long term with regular feed sachet use we do have one type for persimmon
which is just a release sachet which is just it's literally just to stop the carrier from getting in
the crop if you're in flower all the other ones are breeding sachets so they've got the food and
everything in there so they're that that's what's happening is it's for all the food is in that
sachet and it's like a it's a life system it's a life cycle in there so the prey might it's cycling
in there and constantly coming out so there's no such thing as like a feeder sachet there is like
some sometimes we'll put in it's not a big part of the industry but there's two things you can do
on top of that which maybe I think you're maybe thinking of is where you're actually putting some
food in the crop for the predator mites to boost the numbers so you can put we generally use again
those feeder mites will to sell bottles of just those feeder mites and put them in the crop and
that works because it's we prefer so there's feeder mites there's pollen and there's some
other stuff like like artemia which is kind of like a brine shrimp different feeding sources
I'm generally not a big believer in them on especially on cannabis because they I don't
find they're needed a ton on that crop and they also are a big source of contaminants so to me
I'm like when you're putting brine shrimp on something like that yourself at the end of the
day like somebody's telling me I have a shellfish allergy I don't know but it's a source of
potential contamination and the same with pollen so all that pollen that people will use on it
first of all it can feed thrips so you're also feeding the pest where so that's not a good thing
again it's a complicated issue there's some situations where I'd say that is a good idea
most of the time I'd say no when why we prefer just using the
the feeder mites is because it doesn't feed the pest so as first year kookamaras it
nutritionally is a lot better for it to eat protein than that like it's going to make it
reproduce better and then you don't have to worry about a thrips thrips isn't going to eat a feeder
mite so I think that's maybe what you're thinking about there's also some other for some other bios
there's like cards and stuff that can hang in the crop I'm I said I personally not a big believer
with it on cannabis for a bunch of reasons the other thing you got to remember with pollen
is all that pollen mostly comes from China and wherever it comes from so it's it's cocktail
pollen and the pesticide residue not that they're spraying it but like most stuff has pesticide
residue like maybe it's close to an agricultural crop or whatever it goes through the water table
so you never know what you're actually introducing into your crop like when you're getting residue
testing if you're putting pollen out there you know pollen quite often can have pesticide residue
in it on some level so I think that's probably what you're mistaking but yeah sachets is just
generally a sachet is a breeding sachet and that's a system on its own yeah no thank you for the
clarification I think I had read about brine shrimp when you were talking about but yeah that you
answer the question nevertheless so thank you very much and I mean while we're on the topic of crop
contamination something I had heard from primarily soilless growers actually whenever the topic of
predators were raised was that it sort of always came across as this sort of contrarian thing to
say in my opinion but they would say oh you know yeah predator mites but don't they just eat the
bad predators and then they still poo on the plant and then that's contamination blah blah blah
I had never really heard of this being a meaningful issue or something that had
sort of been considered a realistic detractant from using predators and then it also negates
the point that you've gotten rid of the infestation which is you know sort of the number one goal
what's your view on that sort of opinion that even predators will put excrement on the plant
is it something you think there's any real merit to worrying about or it's more of a superficial
concern to a meaningful solution to an actual bug infestation I think that'd be another one
that my answer would be both it can be an issue it's I would say it's not generally an issue it's
like anything you have to use stuff correctly but if used correctly it's a non-issue so I would first
of all caveat like Canada for anyone like that's not familiar with it's probably the most regulated
cannabis market in the world because it's always been regulated not always but since it's been
legal it's been regulated on a federal level by the government so it's it's honestly kind of
ridiculous how regulated the market is so everything is like as far as contaminants
we probably I would say we 100% have the most regulated market that comes from that and it
has essentially never come up the only time I have ever seen it come up which was issues when
it was both the pest there was pest in the crop that was contaminating it and yes there was bios
in the crop also that was eating the pest so I'd say well does it really make a difference whether
you've got spider mites and persimilis in your contamination or just spider mites it's the same
thing so where I would so I'd say mostly it's a non-issue but I do think it is a potential issue
so I'd say if you've got pests in the crop anyways I don't think it really makes any difference
but a lot of the cases like we're trying not to have pests in there so that's when you really have
to have a strategy when you go about it so the the issue with those sachets that you need to be
aware about so most stuff it's not going to reproduce in the crop unless it's got a pest
for instance like if you put persimilis in a spider mite crop or in a spider mite infested
crop persimilis will keep reproducing in the crop as long as there's spider mites there within about
a week of there being no spider mites it just eats it cannibalizes itself and it's gone so
that's really a non-issue but when you get breeding sachets it can be an issue because
then it's giving a source of food so that sachet basically you hang that in your crop it's releasing
feeder mites and predator mites in your crop for about four weeks so when with our program we
always front load something so for instance in cannabis for like swirsky or californicus we
would only ever put sachets in like right when your crop's going into flowering that's kind of
like you do once the start of veg basically let's say you're vegging for three weeks you're going to
put sachets in then to cover your veg area you put them into flower you put another round of sachets
in because the first ones would have expired and then that's going to kind of protect you up until
your buds start to stack you know for three or four weeks what you don't and i do see people do
this sometimes what you really don't want to do is be hanging them like in week four and then you've
got sachets that are releasing right until week eight well 100 you are going to get not just fecal
matter contamination but actual mite contamination is it a big issue not really i don't think most
of the time you'll even see it but i personally wouldn't do it to me like you really want to finish
that you know the last half of your crop with nothing in it like there should be no
test there there should be no bio controls in it so it's like one of the things that people
blow it up the way people talk about it i'd say that's really not an issue yes the predator mites
poop absolutely stodopests like so it's it's one of those things you just need to time the
applications properly and it's and it's a non-issue yeah a great answer there i guess as you mentioned
in an ideal world the second half of the the fruiting the flowering phase is sort of ideal
conditions but in a sort of more realistic world one of the questions which time and time again
comes up is how do i fight off an infestation that i've only just realized is there like week
four week five you know so you're on that second half you know it's a tough question i understand
but i guess i'm always interested how would you personally go about tackling say a mite infestation
that really only been picked up around week four week five a flower yeah there's not a great answer
for that because there it's one of those things that there's can will bios do help you there
yes can they turn again if we're talking about spider mites specifically you're really that's
getting to the point where it's the point of no return so what happens with predator mites is
because they're you know they live on the underside of the leaf primarily they're walking around the
leaf like that's how they hunt and they'll walk like if you put a predator mite on you know one
leaf it'll walk up the whole plant walk to the next plant if the leaves are touching like they
get around but like the you know trichomes that's what they're there for is to protect the plant
against bugs right so predator mites they'll get stuck in the trichomes like it's toxic to them
they get stuck physically get stuck to it um you know the terpenes probably in some varieties are
anti you know they're probably mitocidal um and also just the buds just from physical like when
you get you know a dense but a predator might can't literally walk through it so let's say
you have spider mites i see this is a pretty common problem where somebody doesn't pay and
they don't pay attention all of a sudden they're like holy cow i got spider mites and it's week
six or something like that and then they want to put stuff on well like you basically have to put
the persimmon on every leaf you want it because it can't walk through the buds so there's some
tricks that you can kind of like you can do it but like so on a home garden it's doable on a
commercial garden it's pretty much impossible because you just like that's biocontrol you're
relying on the biocontrol to do the work for you of walking through the crop and finding the pests
and they just can't do it anymore um so there's stuff you can do but a lot of that time you're
really getting into physical controls like you're getting into you know wiping the leaves
with moist cloth or you know in commercial really your only option is you know you can spray them a
bit with water to break them up and the main option is physical removal just going through
deleting the stuff and hoping for the best there's really people want to hear there's a great solution
the great solution is pay attention to your crop earlier on because you didn't just get spider
mites in week four this doesn't happen yeah 100 100 and i guess that's one of the reasons why
you know we sort of advocate you know spend time with your plants you'll you'll pick up on these
things i guess one of the options people would maybe consider as you sort of referenced it that
week four week five infestation stages they might think oh i've got to spray with something uh what's
your what's your thoughts on neem oil i i think something which i've heard of a little bit is
there's maybe a little bit of a misconception like people get predators and then they spray neem oil
and i'm like oh i think you're killing the predators there um doesn't really seem to be
clear consensus in some people's minds what's your thoughts on neem oil and would you ever use it in
the presence of already released predators um i think neem oil probably has a place i've definitely
i've used it long long ago we run into it a fair bit i generally steer away from it and in canada
in canada neem oil for reasons beyond me is really highly regulated so it doesn't actually come up
like you're not allowed to use it you're not even allowed to sell it so i have had a fair bit of
experience with people using it so i'd rather than focus on neem i would say just generally
any type of botanical is a good idea to stay away from with biocontrol so i i would say two things
one i've never seen anybody actually control pests properly with them people all swear by it but they
still all have spider mites or thrips and neem is definitely a powerful tool i mean we both know
that in certain situations um in specifically in using it with biocontrol most and again most of
our business is in conventional agriculture so we've got a lot of experience with side effects
like the side effects of pesticides of all kinds on beneficial insects every time not every time but
most a lot of our problems when you come into side effects on beneficials come from botanicals
botanicals have just like they're having an effect on your mites of some level they're also
having an effect on your predator mites so i generally steer clear of them completely
not just neem to rule it out i my personal view is i'm big on like if i want to spray i mean like
soaps work great if you use them well soap is just like the second it's dry you can put predators in
there's no residual like they're good to go same with some of the um the fungus like the you know
bovary and stuff like that the entomopathogenic fungi those are generally useful i personally like
after like i said i've kind of grown up around all of it i've grown up around the cannabis scene i've
grown up around big commercial greenhouses where they spray a lot of pesticides and i've grown up
around coper where we use a lot of biocontrol i personally on cannabis would almost never spray
like that's one of the things that people i really in the majority of situations i would never spray
for a pest and i'm not just saying that because i sell biocontrol i honestly think you get better
control with biocontrol than you will with sprays most of the time um it's one of the big myths i
find in biocontrol is people really underestimate how strong biocontrol and they is and they
overestimate how strong some magic potion is yeah a brilliant answer you sort of touched on just the
topic just in your answer you know sort of biocontrol myths i'd be interested to hear
are there any other sort of common biocontrol myths that you find yourself dealing with
um probably i mean that's a big one is just that people really underestimate they really
don't get how powerful it is like a lot of people um like i said i would like to use my example when
i came from coper came to copert initially i had this i had the same perception where i thought it
was kind of like this you know it's good you're not you're not affecting the environment it
probably don't work that well but you know you know what it's environmentally sound blah blah
blah and the first literally my first day at work at coper they took me to this greenhouse
that was just the highest um pest pressure i've ever seen in my life and they had literally
switched to bio to almost entirely biocontrols because the pesticides just didn't work so not
a pesticides didn't work they needed to use them so frequently that the pest had just become
resistant to them all so it was like in a normal situation yeah that pesticide works great if you
use it once or twice a year not if you're using it you know 50 times a year and so that was really
eye-opening to me that when you got into a situation like that and you're like wow like
they're not even this is the highest pest pressure i've ever seen in my life and they're not even
using any pesticides they're literally just battling it with biocontrol is winning so that's
one of the big things i think people just need to wrap their head around it's really a strong tool
one of the other ones that comes up all the time is the climate so definitely people like there's
definitely differences with um different bio controls have different climate preferences
but people really over complicate this so like first of all like most crop plants grow in the
same rough you know temperature and relative humidity situations so like you never have so
people are like oh i don't want to use persimmonless because i've got these special climate conditions
i have like i said i've worked here for 15 years i've basically never seen anyone with a special
climate condition um that you couldn't use biocontrol with one caveat if you're growing
some crops nothing to do with cannabis that's really cold then that's a situation on cannabis
it always works fine um do they work as well as they would in an optimized climate like for
instance one of the big things is relative humidity so a lot of predator might be really
like a higher relative humidity um so you know and you know when we're finishing you know especially
indica strains you're going really way down like 40 45 relative humidity that's definitely not
ideal for a predator might but one of the one of the agricultural research stations near where i
live actually did a big uh like a peer-reviewed journal article years ago on this and they
actually measured the climate conditions on the phyloplane which is the you know the immediate
leaf surface uh you know the underside of the leaf and what they found is that phyloplane which is
that's specifically where the predator might is living it's a huge buffer against the environment
so even though we're going down and again i'm making these numbers up so don't hold me verbatim
to them but like let's say you're cranking your relative humidity down for late flowering at like
you know 40 or 45 that phyloplane um climate it's probably still like 70 or something like that like
it's very hard to deviate to make that microclimate change because they are um because of
the stomata so the first of all like the leaf is kind of shielding it from the light the stomata
is one of the big things it's you know it's letting it water vapor underneath the leaf so in
there you know we're just talking about you know quarter of a millimeter or something like that
it's still humid there so they it's not as big of a deal as they think about it it's honestly
something that unless your temperature is under like 20 or 20 degrees celsius all the time you
don't really need to worry about it um they there are people will be like hey doesn't know what he's
talking about there's um their eggs dehydrated at a low relative humidity that can sometimes be true
for sure but you can still use biocontrol yes maybe it just doesn't reproduce as well um we like
i said biocontrol has been absolutely standard in canada for cannabis production since the start of
legalization so i don't know many years that is quite a few um it's what it's a well-proven thing
um it left so in the us just because of a couple other reasons just because they had more pesticides
and it was less regulated but for sure in canada everybody's been using cannabis um
or biocontrol on cannabis since the start everyone has very similar climates it works fine
yeah brilliant explanation there and given your experience in the canadian market a question which
a lot of the american listeners are often sort of interested in is what do you think will be some of
the biggest pest issues facing the cannabis market for example in the us as it continues to expand
and get bigger and more people get involved yeah well there's two things the biggest pest issue i
think is probably always it can be thrips and spider mites but they're also ones that there's
good tools for they're fairly easy to control um might be a little bit different when you get into
down in the more southern parts of the u.s so one of the things you get is like for instance if we
look at thrips that's for sure like one of the big issues um but we've got a lot of good tools
like all the biocontrols work really well on trips but 99 of all the trips we deal with in canada and
northern u.s is western flower trips or onion trips and we know biocontrol works really well
on that but there's thousands different types of trips so when you get down into like you know
southern florida probably southern california any of those southern areas there's a lot of different
types of trips the biocontrol doesn't work for so that could emerge as an issue where there's just
not any great tools like not the traditional tools don't work that's to be seen right now i would say
the bigger issue is most likely aphids um because and maybe hemp rust maybe russet might for two
reasons or for one in the same reason that there's not a lot of great solutions for it so aphid control
is really challenging there are some great solutions for it but the thing with aphids is they
live birth so when when you get one aphid in your garden um they're already like they don't need to
sexually reproduce so they've already got all their babies inside them ready to go and i believe
some entomologists probably correct me i'm pretty sure those babies are literally like the second
they come out they've already got babies ready to go so they reproduce at a scary rate like i've
seen multiple times where someone's literally got like one cannabis aphid in their garden and you
come back three weeks later and like the whole garden is ready to come down so we have predators
that work really really well on them it's really hard to get rid of all of the aphids though so
like the thing when something's like that you literally have to get when it reproduces that fast
you need to get rid of every single aphid to control the problem and that doesn't really
happen very often either with spraying or um biocontrol it does happen if you've got like a
real you know heavy synthetic systemic spray you can get rid of it's one treatment but i don't think
that's likely to be an option so i think that's going to be a real challenge just because
biocontrol for aphids as all we kind of know what all the tools are when it comes to biocontrols
and we know they it's it's challenging to get rid of aphids 100 it's pretty easy to control them 80
but you don't necessarily especially with cannabis even it is really for anyone that doesn't have
them don't get them they are absolute nightmares um it's basically it's essentially impossible to
get rid of them once you get them so just don't get them everyone brings them in on clones like
it's very preventable preventable pest but it's not a particularly controllable pest and in russet
mite or whatever any of those tarsomid mites they haven't really emerged too much as a pest so far
in canada i know that it was more of an issue down in california and colorado but it does have
the potential just because um they kind of have a niche where predator mites generally are pretty
good at controlling stuff like russet mite but again they're hard to control them 100 so a russet
mite or broad mite they're really tiny so they're a lot smaller than a predator mite so that's kind
of their evolutionary niche is they can get into spots where the where the predators can't get so
for instance if you got a plant in flowering it can go way deep into a trichome stand where a
swirsky even though it can eat it or a californicus can eat it it can't get in that in that uh stand
and you get same thing you can go like in growing tips and stuff so generally what we've seen again
i'm looking not just at camps but other crops usually when people use biocontrol as a main
standard those pests like russet mite or broad might aren't much of an issue because preventatively
they do a really good job of stopping them from ever getting established and it's kind of why i
think maybe you saw that emergence in the early days out of california and um colorado nobody was
really using predators that much back then so and you don't hear about it as much and we've
definitely had a couple of outbreaks in canada at lps but it's been very very low but it could be
like the potential and they're ones that's very easily spread through cutting material and that's
the one thing i've seen in the legalized industries there's really a just an unprecedented amount of
spreading of clones between facilities and that's something that could easily get going but if i
had to pick one it would be 100 cannabis aphid second would probably be root aphid yeah i mean
there's certainly two pests i've seen cause havoc in a variety of different grow environments
something i was hoping to get your opinion on is i'd noticed i'd been to a few bigger facilities
when i'd been over in the states and it sort of seemed to me like when a facility got to a certain
size it just sort of reached this critical mass and pest infestation was almost inevitable from
what i had seen and admittedly limited number of sites i'd been to you've probably been to many more
larger facilities than i have would you agree that you've seen that sort of thing happen regularly or
is my experience is maybe a little skewed and that's not what normally happens no it's definitely
true we've also seen it on other crops there's a general rule as as the facility gets bigger the
pest issues get bigger also i think it's for a bunch of reasons i think more of it though is like
i've definitely seen because i've kind of seen this evolve and you get um even you'll get guys
that when they've got small scenes you're kind of on top of like for instance thrips is one of
things like i've seen and same with spider mites i've seen guys that have literally they've been
growing for like 10 years on you know they maybe got a 40 lighter they've never had thrips and all
of a sudden they get them and they can never get rid of them are the thrips under control they're
like yes like they're using bio control it controls them but i think it's like one of those things like
once you get thrips in your crop that's like that's just one of the big things that i think
people don't understand properly when it comes to pests is the difference between like a thrips or
any pest and a thrips that's adapted to the crop that you're in so when you get a thrips that you
know let's say you get a thrips infestation by default you know you've got a gazillion thrips
in there some of them really like cannabis right and those tend to be the ones that reproduce so
then you get them really um adapted to your environment and they're really hard to get rid
of because like again all you need is you know one or two thrips i guess two trips and so you
you know maybe you don't have them for it looks like you don't have trips for two months and then
they come back well it's just because you didn't it's almost impossible to get rid of every single
trips out of your facility so i think when those guys were smaller it wasn't they could go a long
time without ever getting trips but now they're bigger eventually it comes in from somewhere once
you get them you've got them for good like trips just if you look at any other crop which is just
like a standard like anyone thinks they're never going to have thrips is dreaming like they're just
a they're everywhere right they're outside in the grass they're coming in on your workers they're
coming in on eggs in your plant material like there's too many avenues for them to come in so
um yeah i think that'd be my answer for that one yeah okay i mean you've got me sort of thinking
now what might be some of the sort of specific challenges the cannabis plant presents in a
biocontrol program or like for example even just the environment you know are there any sort of
room conditions which might make biocontrol more challenging or more easy in fact
yeah the biggest i mean the biggest room condition it generally hasn't been much of an issue the one
thing i've had now that people have kind of dialed in their systems i don't see it as much but back
when those first facilities started getting built you know large scale i saw a bunch of times where
people had their horizontal airflow fans just mounted too low and there seemed to be a pressure
all right some guys that really like to you probably seem like you wanted their crop and
you're like man it's like a tropical storm in here you know the plants are bending over they've just
got so much fans going on them and that's the only thing that i've really seen in cannabis
production that's caused a big issue so for instance we had a facility that had a big they
had a trips problem but the trips problem was only around the perimeter of the room and what it was
was in the perimeter of the room those fans were creating like a microclimate they were just
basically drying out the leaf so much that the predator mites just couldn't live on there so the
predator mice were working fine in the middle of the room but when it got close to the fans they
the trips were taking over because the thrips were able to uh you know tolerate that high wind so
that's really been the main thing that i think we've seen and it's not that common it's kind of
now that people realize plants don't really like to be grown in a tropical storm condition
uh people have moved away from that the plant itself definitely presents some challenges and
one of the biggest so there's two the two main challenges is one that a lot of
uh predator mites don't reproduce on it the way they reproduce on other crops um
so like i said if i kind of got into this before where they really need that specialized plant
hair to lay their eggs on and i think you get some like i definitely seen some reproduction
but if i compare it to like a pepper crop or a cucumber crop it's nothing compared to those
crops like they really those are ones you could literally put in a little bit of loose stuff in
one corner and you come back you know two months later and there's predator mites like over your
whole crop with cannabis you really need to put the constant supply in there to keep the numbers
up high enough so that's one thing that people they try and extrapolate what's gone on in other
crops and you can't really do it from peppers to cannabis it's different crops you really want to
make sure you've got again not during during peak flower but you want to have a continuous source of
predator mice which usually means sachets and then the other thing that people you really need
to front load it so like for instance like a pepper crop or a lot of other crops um you've got
like a long window to control your pests in like a pepper crop goes for like a year in a greenhouse
um with cannabis i mean i don't know what the average get to look at i mean probably the average
guy's vegging for like two weeks and then they've got another two or three weeks in flowering before
the buds are too stacked up to control them properly so you've got at best a four or five
week window to work with so you can't use conventional rates so for instance on a
vegetable crop you might put 10 per meter persimmonless in because it's got you know
months to control of spider maize in cannabis you maybe got four or five weeks so i mean instead of
10 you're putting in like 100 or something like that so that's something you really need to
compensate you really need to go hard like front load everything you want to be treating your it
really starts at your mom's you want to make your you really want to just start from the
from the start of the whole thing and then you're ramping off as you get into flowering not what a
lot of people do is go holy cow i got a big problem and then they start ramping up as you go into bio
as into flowering you really want a strong preventative approach and to be on those things
before your buds stack up once you're in like you know depending on the strain once the first
i find most strains it's like the first third of flowering is the stretch period like the
veg period so you really want to have all your pests controlled done within that first one third
yeah a brilliant sentiment hopefully people can start implementing that one so they don't
find themselves in the uh the dreaded week four week five surprise of finding the the russet mites
are actually everywhere sort of got me thinking about the future of ipm strategies and pest
management and something i was hoping you might have some insight into is it's anecdotally said
that various strains have different susceptibility to pests it's sort of long anecdotally been said
that plants with the strong blueberry lineage are like almost like magnets for pests at least that's
been some of my experience do you think these sort of anecdotes are true that like certain
phenotypes or certain strains are just inherently far more susceptible to pest infestation and as a
follow-up do you think that breeding for pest resistance might become a more focal part of pest
management in general in the future yeah it's 100 true like there's no doubt about that we've seen it
so many times um with i've seen it in lps i've seen it like it's a standing joke in the canadian
cannabis community there was this clone going around called uh people call it the perps or
vancouver island uh purple indica and it is the every person i've known that's had this thing it
is the most pest prone thing you've ever got like if you've got an aphid in the garden it's on this
clone it just and partly i think it's really old clones so when plants get older they become
more attractive to pests but it's definitely like this clone is a pest magnet we actually do at
copra we are actually doing research on on uh on cannabis aphid control we specifically actually
used that clone because we knew the cannabis aphid just loved it and i've seen it a lot i don't think
anyone can like i think we're definitely we've seen for instance sativa like really sativa ones
they tend to get thrips really early but again it depends it comes down to the terpene thing i
think there's it so it's so variable i've definitely seen a lot of hazes really get thrips um bad um
i think terpene is one of the bigger issues and where i think people overthink it but is it can
breeding be done probably i personally think it's more of a disease thing than pest thing i think
stuff like that purple indigo clone will just naturally get called out of the population
because you back wants to deal with with that um i think disease resistance is very much an
something that needs to be done and will be done in breeding specifically for powdery mildew and
botrytis um pest one i'm not i'm not sure i do i've definitely seen some people steer themselves
wrong where they're like no no i'm not going to grow any haze because i know i heard that haze
gets whatever thrips or something else and i mean you know you know yourself like it's not so
it's not like any of the strains that are so um stable like every different phenotype is slightly
different so i think you got people that are like i'm not growing og kush because it's this and i
was like well why don't you if you grow a pack you're probably gonna get one that really gets
thrips and another one that thrips won't even go close to it so it's not so black and white and
i've definitely seen some lps getting into that where they're like i'm not growing out because
it's this strain and they're like dude like all hazes aren't the same um it's not you can't make
those blanket statements but definitely from clone to clone that is not a urban legend that is for
sure real that some stuff is far more susceptible to different pests than others yeah okay that's
really interesting to hear and good to know it's uh it's not all in my head another question i was
interested in is that i've noticed there can be sort of a variability in activity levels of some
of the mites i've gotten are there any recommendations you have that can help ensure once i do have the
predator and i'm releasing it in the garden that i'm sort of getting the most out of them you know
are there any sort of factors which i may unawaringly hindering them or you know accidentally
killing them off after releasing them um not too much usually if there's an issue with like the
only two real issues is like spraying is one um excess airflow is another just like like direct on
the plant but the one thing i would i'd caveat that statement with is that they're definitely
like predator mites like there's a lot to them so you there's definitely suppliers on the market
that probably sell some pretty crappy predator mites um but what i would caveat is i would say
um like i run you know part of my job is i kind of oversee a lot of the the sales complaints and
stuff that come in and i would say the vast majority of complaints that we get um for
especially for predator mites they're just perceived complaints they're not there's not
actually anything wrong with the product so like they're hard to see like especially if you don't
know what you're look like if you're not really trained for what you're looking for and a lot of
people they're looking at it with a bare eye well i've been doing this for like half my life and i
can't tell you without a microscope so there's a couple of things to keep in mind so one predator
mites because they're so tiny like they're really hard to count so what you can definitely get is a
real thing like let's say you buy a bottle of persimmon let's say it's supposed to be 10 000 in
it most of the time there's more like 15 or 17 000 in there because they overpack everything and i'm
sure we're not the only company that does that because you need to guarantee there's 10 000
you can't have somebody sitting there it's very difficult to calculate exactly how much is in
there so people overshoot it so let's say we're and don't call many of these numbers but it's
definitely like this like it's okay you're way over the spec and then maybe there's a like first
of all those populations fluctuate a little bit so the same amount of material one week might have
whatever 10 000 mites the next week might have 17 000 mites so it fluctuates and you get people
what people don't get so we're guaranteeing a minimum and quite often they're getting way more
than that and then what happens is yeah there's some weeks that you're actually getting what we
say you're getting and but you get used to seeing something and it's not accurate you know what I
mean you're getting used to seeing way more than you're actually paying for that's definitely a big
a big issue and the thing also is predator mites people don't get like there's a it's not like
there's some bios that are difficult to ship predator mites are one of the easiest things
to ship because they've got it because you're not shipping them dormant like there's a food
source in there so they're just alive and at room temperature most of the time so there's not really
a whole lot to go wrong in transport so does it happen sure sometimes absolutely but it's a very
small percentage of the time that that's great that answers what I was wondering almost perfectly
so up next we actually had a question submitted from one of our patreon listeners and they
basically said look you know I love that I'm just going to read it word for word because I love the
way they've worded it they say thrips are the devil they naturally occur outdoors in my area
and it's impossible to grow a plant without getting them I've knocked them down before but
they always come back if the plant stays healthy and they don't take them over it's just a constant
fight without pesticides beneficials help but they don't seem to ever reproduce enough to keep
up have you got any suggestions yeah so I think and you do get some air like the out the outdoor
kind of ambient level thrips can vary a lot between different places like I don't always
remember I had a greenhouse like I said I grew where I live is like there's literally 3 000 acres
of greenhouses in 20 minutes I mean so I've seen like a lot of pest pressure and like I've seen a
lot of crops and but I also do all of the work all over Canada and I remember being out in the
prairies once and which is a drier grassy kind of habitat and we could never control thrips at this
one facility and I remember trying to put my finger on like what was going on and I was like you know
what I'm just going to hang some sticky cards outside to see like what the outside pressure
trips was and this is like a 10 acre greenhouse or something and I hung a yellow sticky card
outside one end of the greenhouse and then I drove to the end which maybe took you know two
minutes or something like that and hung another one and just on a fluke on the way back I was like
I'll just check that first card and see if it caught anything yet and that first card had like
you know 10 000 trips on or something where where I live it would have like one if that um so it
really can be different so you definitely can get some areas where you're just getting a crazy amount
of strips coming inside so I don't know whether he's outdoors or in a greenhouse or indoors
there's definitely a lot of buffer between you so I'd say if you're getting a big problem in a small
indoor place you're probably making the problem yourself even though you don't want to admit it
um so basically where I think most people go wrong it when thrips control is they are not most people
but when there's a problem it's generally to the to do with this issue is predator mice they're
they are your best your kind of baseline attack but predator mites doesn't matter what kind they're
only used they're only eating the first n star of thrips so that's thrips will lay its egg on the
plant and then that egg hatches out into the first larval stage which is kind of like a little worm
that has no wings it can just call it out and feeds so thrips or a swirsky or kookamaras they
only eat that one stage so once it gets past that stage if you're just using predator mites
there's all these strips in your crop that you're not controlling at all and then an adult thrips
in some in some temperatures it'll last like a month two months even longer so that can be like
your whole crop where you've got this big strips problem and you're putting in swirsky thinking you
did something but you've got all these adult serbs flying around you know causing chaos that nothing
is controlling so you really have to go a multi same with any pets you need to go with a multi-pronged
approach so for there you're going to put your predator mites as your kind of base level control
but then you need to put something else in to get those other stages out of the equation and the best
especially on cannabis because it really like the cannabis plant is a product or trade name is
thrip or but it's a aureus and that's like a predatory bug so it can fly around and they're
like thrips killers like they're generous but they really like killing thrips and you put like they
will literally turn get rid of all the thrips in like a week usually the problem with like and they
go after all the different stages the problem is if you were to not put the predator mite and just
put in the thrip or or the aureus is they'll eat all your thrips and then they die off because
there's no food and then there's a whole bunch of trips eggs in the leaf which two weeks later hatch
out and then there's no predator for them and bang you've got a trips problem again so that's why you
always want that overlapping you know the predator mites are controlling any new stuff coming up and
then the thrip or is killing any of the larger stages another one it doesn't work quite as well
but it's a it's a viable strategy is to use a lot of sticky cards so sticky cards will catch the
adult trips that are attracted to it so you can also use that combination where you're using a
predator mites to go after those young stages the sticky cards to go after the to catch the adults
so i most of the time when i see people have issues with trips it's because they're ignoring
those other life cycle stages i guess it sort of segues into the future of products you know
a lot of uh recent and interesting new technologies are emerging in the predator and ipm industry and
one that we've been talking about a little bit at the start of our episodes is um some of the new
technology you guys have been working on particularly the one that caught my eye was
the spidex vital that proof of predation technology was really interesting from my perspective because
it gives you that real-time feedback on the activity levels of the mites with that um you
know changing color sort of technology do you think that that'll become a new industry standard
having these sort of built-in features around predators and do you have any other cool things
on the horizon you might be able to let us know about um so i don't know that and so that's an
interesting one because the the what that so what happens is when you buy the predator mite
it's translucent so you can see through it so and then when it eats spider mites it turns bright red
so that was kind of a side effect of something else so that spider mites was that one like i
said it was the last remaining predator mite that nobody could figure out how to rear on something
other than its natural prey source so it's a it's a consequence of eating spider mites that makes it
red so in the old up until this year we used to rear them on spider mites so they'd be red when
you bought them um now we figured out how to rear them on a different food source um so they're
actually not red and it's a really cool thing because you put them into the crop and they're
clear and they instantly so there's no doubt about whether they're working you're like well are they
red okay well then it's eating spider mites like it's that clear because that's the only thing that
can make them red but it wasn't there as an indicator it's just something that was kind of
a cool thing that um that you know was an added benefit um so that was kind of the last one for
like all the other predator mites were always like that so i don't know whether that will
be uh where the future i actually don't know where the future a lot of it will probably be some new
predator mites is really the forefront of the of biocontrol it's you know not for some pests like
aphids and whitefly or whitefly a little bit but um just because they're really they're cost
effective because they're quite inexpensive to rear and um versus like if you're using some of
the other you know macro type of bios like a parasitic wasp and stuff generally they've got to
be reared on a pest and that's cost-provided because you've got to have a greenhouse with a
crop in it then you got to put a pest it's so i'm going to guess that probably more along those lines
of rearing stuff on fictitious hosts um is going to be the future and possibly some new you know
new biologicals that um you know maybe there's a new a different parasitic wasp that doesn't exist
isn't commercialized right now that's really good on you know better on cannabis aphid or
a different predator mite that's really good on hemp rust it might there's probably stuff like
that in the future but that yeah i just sell them they tell me that when it's when it's ready to
sell i don't i don't get too much of the privy on the on the behind the scenes the rnd and sorry
what was the other part of your question for that one i i guess the other question was do you think
these sort of features like for example the proof of predation and things like that will sort of
start to become integrated as sort of mainstays in predators to or do you think that's just a one-off
sort of situation yeah i think that's just a one-off i mean that proof of prediction is there
it's just left noticeable i think it's more that people are gonna like we're really at an infant
level especially in the cannabis industry in understanding biocontrol um like can still think
they're so innovative but honestly like most of the other crops are years ahead of them when it
comes to understanding biocontrol because they've just been using it for a long time so for instance
that same proof of predation i mean you can see with swirsky mite that it changes color depending
on which pest um it has like i can look in a crop and look at the color of your swirsky and tell you
whether you get a pest problem or not because of the shade of amber it is but you know there's lots
of stuff like that um so i think that just the general understanding has a lot of room to to come
up i think most people are not at it's really it's changed rapidly in cannabis you know in those years
because that's the first time where i said a lot of the industry i'd say is a little bit
maybe ahead is the wrong word but the cannabis industry has definitely evolved way faster
because it's the only industry where they literally got like some dude with a phd in
biocontrol that's running their biocontrol thing but it's just it's a newer crop right so
wasn't that common before legalization to use biocontrol yeah okay yeah that's that makes sense
for sure it's it's definitely a new crop where not everything is the same as prior one of the
sort of final questions i wanted to ask you that was of personal interest to me because i am
unapologetically biased towards organic grow styles do you think that organic grow styles
sort of have a innate better chance to fight off pests than cocoa or do you think it's relatively
an even battlefield oh man you're trying to make an internet uh give me some internet haters
views expressed are mine alone and not yours so this is going to get a whole lot of hate but i
would say unanimously and copra is like a big company so like we're all over the world and
literally some of the top best control people in the world work for us i would say pretty much
unanimously everyone that i work with in copra and in commercial greenhenders thinks that's
largely a bunch of hokey um i have not seen that i think it's probably like most things there's a bit
of both things i've honestly seen the most pest infested crops as a general rule are the organic
ones not the conventional ones and i'm an organic guy i really believe in organic agriculture i'm
telling you the truth and i think what agriculture people miss about organic stuff is like one of the
missing links is like the nutrition levels like so you get a plant it's very hard to dial in the
nutrition especially in the greenhouse or indoors where it's like a really intensive you know
lighting regime and stuff like that to get a properly dialed in um plant for nutrients
in my opinion is way easier with synthetic with synthetic fertilizer and you'll see even if you've
ever read steve solomon's book he's one of the you know gurus of organic it's one of the things
that he discovers once you start looking into like the nutritional value of organic food
yeah it doesn't have pesticide residues and it's probably got a lot of attributes for like you know
maybe it's got higher antioxidants and stuff but when you start looking at like okay well how much
calcium does it have in it or how much phosphorus is it having it a lot of times the organic stuff
is really low compared to synthetic not that it's not possible but that's just the reality so
i think that's part of the problem i get healthy like i said i think a healthy plant is more
resistant to diseases but i think or pests and diseases but i also think it's it's definitely
over inflated i'm not going to be an expert or a you know the the word but like i've seen like
there might be something to it but when you see like i've just seen thousands and thousands and
thousands of acres of crops and a lot of times pests show up willy-nilly they're not necessarily
going for the weakest plant that does happen sometimes but a lot of times it's just like
they just show up randomly so let's say it's not as true as everybody thinks and i think a lot of
it comes down it's not to do with whether it's organic or conventional it's to do with what the
nutrition level is in the plant that actually makes sense i want i want to believe man i literally
have come from that like i i literally was in amsterdam in like 95 when positronics used to do
like they were like the original proprietors of no-till i was there like i learned from those
guys and i actually i'm a i'm a no-till non-believer i'll just i'll just say it not a non-believer
but i've been there and i've left and i will never go back i just i think there's a lot of
like i'm not convinced that that's the best plan on multiple levels and i know that's a
heavily a highly unpopular opinion but that's my no that's good and you know what it also it makes
me start thinking that you know there's sort of a lot of variables in the equation because as you
said it actually totally makes sense to me that the worst gardens you see with infestations are
organic because if they're utilizing the things we've touched on earlier like neem and things
like that in an attempt to stay organic but uh you know maybe somewhat ineffective whereas maybe you
know the soilless guys are a little more ready to use some of the more bang for your buck type
principles be it pesticides things like that but that's interesting to know and it's good to hear
because it's sort of for a long time i've been wondering why the biggest producers are all
soilless so that's probably a pretty good reason why right like it's just it plays into it i think
well i think there's a bunch of reasons i personally like where my general belief in just
agriculture which like i said i've been in it for like probably around 30 years or more and it's
kind of evolved over time i've been a pure organic guy in some cases and pure synthetic and honestly
when it comes to whether it's plant nutrition um human nutrition or pest control pest and disease
control i'm really a really and i think and copert also is we're really firm believers in integrated
where i don't think that pure organic is the solution and i don't think that pure conventional
is the synthetic is the solution i think the real answer is a combination of the two i think there's
some really good things that organics brings to the table and i think there's some really good
things that just putting chemical salts can bring to the table in in some situations and it's really
the same with bio control like a lot of people think that copert's like we're oh the culprit guy
or the bio control guy he's always going to push bios we don't really believe in pure bio control
there's basically nobody at our company that believes in that we really believe in integrated
um like there's a ton there's certain paths there is just probably never going to be a great
bio control solution you're going to need to whatever use a physical means or or a spray or
something like that and i think that's that's kind of my view on agriculture it's really
everything's integrated and whenever somebody gets too far into their that's their belief system
integrate their ideas too much it's it's not necessarily the best thing and i'd also say
part of the reason why some of those organic places that i've seen like i've seen some really
filthy organic places i've seen some filthy synthetic places too but i'd say part of the
factor in those organic things is the magic factor is they want to believe that everything's magically
taking care of itself and they just don't even look and then you go like i always remember i
won't mention any names or there's one of the guys in canada was literally one of the most famous
organic people here he was one of the pioneers and i was friends with him from before i was in coper
and he said he invited us out to the greenhouse just because we're friends and he's like i'll go
take a look he says i'll tell you up front there's nothing to see there because you know the magic
factor you know we've been organic for so long and everything self-regulates and it's all in
balance and it was the filthiest crop i've ever seen and this was a place that literally that
was the highest the most expensive produce in the time in canada and it was absolutely filthy and it
was because of he he believed that it was clean and chefs probably believe that it's clean because
he keeps telling him how magic everything was so i'm kind of a i don't know become more of a
practical practicalist that's the word for over over the years yeah no i i'm on board i'm on board
our inherent biases make fools of us all right that's really interesting to hear that that's
how it sort of played out for you i will have to keep that in mind but um with that being said i
think that pretty much brings us to the end of what i was hoping to chat about did you have any
comments or shout outs you wanted to make um no no no real comments shout outs to all the people
that like bringing us new bio controls and new technologies because i think those are the people
that they get underrated there's a lot of everyone doesn't i don't think most people
realize how much work goes into bringing new products um to market those are kind of the
underappreciated people so i'd shout out to all the r&d people that are locked away in a in a lab
somewhere coming up with solutions yeah a huge shout out to those guys and you know likewise
a shout out to yourself and everyone at copit for you know being on board with helping support the
show and helping to sponsor us we really appreciate it and your your support does not go unnoticed so
you know thanks so much kev for coming by and having a chat with us today we really appreciate
it yeah i appreciate having you on and so we don't really like we don't really sponsor a whole lot of

there from kevin copit thanks so much again for coming by my friend really grateful to have you on
and there you have it friends what did you think
however i'm really grateful to have had all the guests on the episode today
matt of premiere tech talking about promix connect and kevin of copit biological systems
thank you so much everyone for coming on we appreciate your support it was great to hear
from you and as always without you guys the show couldn't happen if you guys are after any of the
products you heard today google them online you'll be able to find them all the best products we only
