1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,919
this is the man who is responsible for

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,540
virtually all of the cannabis research

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:08,429
we wouldn't be able to do any of the

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,019
research that we're doing now if it

5
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:13,710
weren't for him he's first synthesized

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,120
and isolated the THC the CBD the CBG all

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,010
of that stuff we wouldn't know anything

8
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,500
about it if it weren't for him and he's

9
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,189
gonna come up and talk to us right now

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,019
please

11
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:23,850
everyone put your hands together and

12
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:42,179
welcome to the stage the one and only

13
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:46,829
dr. Rafael Messi lab thank you for

14
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:49,439
inviting me I'll try the LA next

15
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,350
half-hour to tell you about a little bit

16
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:56,549
about what went on what's going on and

17
00:00:52,350 --> 00:01:02,429
what I hope will happen in the next few

18
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:05,399
years when I started research on

19
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:09,540
cannabis and that was quite a few years

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:13,260
ago nobody was interested as a matter of

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:16,080
fact when I asked for a grant I was told

22
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,909
a grant from NIH in the US I was told

23
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,780
nobody smokes marijuana in the States

24
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:24,450
and they do that in Mexico we think if

25
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,180
you have something more relevant kindly

26
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:30,420
let us know well they change their mind

27
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:34,680
so shortly afterwards somebody important

28
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,680
maybe a senator had asked him what does

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,770
Barry wanna do his son was caught

30
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,720
smoking pot and he wanted to know where

31
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:45,179
he destroys his mind or something and

32
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,280
they didn't have a single grand I didn't

33
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,759
know anything about marijuana so they

34
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:55,680
when they came over to Jerusalem at that

35
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,728
time and took the THC we had isolated

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,310
and

37
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:00,899
elucidated the structure I think they

38
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,060
smuggled it back because they didn't

39
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,450
have a license to do that and for the

40
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,840
next few years most of the work in THC

41
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:13,170
in the States was done with the material

42
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:17,219
that was apparently smoked

43
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:20,659
things have changed nature one of the

44
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:24,120
major scientific journals in the world

45
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:28,020
had a few reviews and this is from our

46
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:31,469
reviewer they put on the first thing a

47
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,620
brain from which cannabis comes out and

48
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:38,459
the reason for that is in the next slide

49
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:41,280
a few scientists at NIH and NIH does a

50
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:44,750
lot of research on cannabis nowadays

51
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,459
they wrote that modulating the

52
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:51,319
endocannabinoid activity may have

53
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:54,870
therapeutic potential in almost all

54
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:57,719
diseases affecting humans and they give

55
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,450
a lot of examples now this is a very

56
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:03,330
very strong statement I don't know if

57
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:05,399
any other biochemical system that is

58
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:10,890
involved in almost all diseases

59
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:14,939
affecting humans and while it may not be

60
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:17,699
hundred percent true it is close to the

61
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:22,019
truth and I'll try to explain why and

62
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:26,659
how this happens but let's start a few

63
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:30,180
years back in my area of the world

64
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:32,579
Assyria and we have a lot of documents

65
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,840
left from that time they wrote a lot of

66
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:39,420
them and stone and so on they used they

67
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,700
used cannabis for essentially all those

68
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:44,069
things that we use cannabis they said

69
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:46,709
that they had a name Gansey goo knew

70
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:50,069
that's the drug that takes away the bind

71
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:52,379
it's not about definition where they

72
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:55,189
thought there was the as a loop of the

73
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:57,629
same plant which was used as a medicine

74
00:03:55,189 --> 00:04:00,479
apparently for neurological diseases

75
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:05,849
we're not so sure and they also use it

76
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:08,429
in their religious rites so it cannabis

77
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:11,280
as we all know has been used more or

78
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:14,030
less over the next couple of thousand

79
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,488
years and I'll just give another example

80
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,728
dr. Russell Reynolds who was the

81
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:22,918
physician of Queen Victoria in England

82
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:25,050
used to import cannabis from India

83
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:26,129
European cannabis was not good enough

84
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,860
for him

85
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:31,050
because she had migraines and he didn't

86
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,240
write that in his paper but it was

87
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,850
obvious because she was the only patient

88
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,040
he had for the relief of certain kinds

89
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:43,980
of pain I believe there is no more

90
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:48,569
useful medicine than cannabis then a lot

91
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:50,939
of research started the middle of this

92
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:54,149
century we were involved and I would

93
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:57,569
like to separate the research that has

94
00:04:54,149 --> 00:05:00,149
been going on in three phases the first

95
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:04,079
one is the phytochemistry name in the

96
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:06,899
chemistry of the plant now most of the

97
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:09,959
people that are involved in cannabis are

98
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:15,269
involved in the phyto cannabinoid

99
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:19,909
research on the materials the compounds

100
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:22,799
that the plant produces but this is

101
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:27,660
these are things that we learnt the

102
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:30,900
describe try to investigate about 30

103
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,439
years ago since then things have been

104
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:35,879
happening

105
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:37,980
first of all the endocannabinoid

106
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:40,500
research namely research and the

107
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:45,930
compounds and the cannabinoids that we

108
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:48,029
make that all mammalians do and this was

109
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,060
small as completed about 10 years ago

110
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:54,029
and since then we have gone into the

111
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,879
third phase of cannabinoid research and

112
00:05:54,029 --> 00:06:00,509
this is compounds that are more or less

113
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:03,000
the same as the compounds we produce but

114
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:08,519
they have different effects so we have a

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,839
whole system whole a lot of compounds

116
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:16,229
that are very very much involved in our

117
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:17,939
physiology and while now at the moment

118
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:23,069
most people are interested in

119
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:24,719
cannabidiol and THC chances are as it

120
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:27,060
happened to it cannabidiol where he

121
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,430
tried to wait for about 30 years chances

122
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:33,720
are that in a meeting like that in about

123
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:36,439
15 years of now most of the talks will

124
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,780
be under endogenous cannabinoids and

125
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:43,019
under cannabinoids have that have more

126
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:45,539
the same structure but have different

127
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:48,419
effects so let me try to go into the

128
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:51,900
three phases of research that I'm

129
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:55,009
speaking about those of you who haven't

130
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:57,329
forgotten their high school chemistry

131
00:06:55,009 --> 00:07:00,089
these are some of the compounds that are

132
00:06:57,329 --> 00:07:03,209
present in cannabis and we discovered

133
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:07,529
most of them about 50 years ago 40 years

134
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:10,560
ago and all of them mol is the same the

135
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:12,929
right hand side is exactly the same

136
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,410
there have been some differences may

137
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:18,269
have discovered C's with mole as the

138
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:20,550
same on the left hand side that the

139
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:24,870
changes and we have today more than

140
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:27,210
hundred compounds of this type but the

141
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,129
two compounds that most people have been

142
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:31,979
interested in are of course

143
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:35,459
cannabidiol and we described the

144
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:39,150
structure of cannabidiol way back 1963

145
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:42,810
and we are isolated I believe for the

146
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:46,649
first time in pure form the act of the

147
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:49,860
active compound THC and elucidated the

148
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:52,228
structure later synthesize it so these

149
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:55,650
two compounds have been of course the

150
00:07:52,228 --> 00:07:58,168
center of interest and those of you who

151
00:07:55,649 --> 00:08:00,449
are involved in cannabis in cannabis

152
00:07:58,168 --> 00:08:04,399
whether it's in research or in the

153
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:08,180
industrial or commercial aspects deal

154
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:11,819
mostly with these two compounds but

155
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:15,629
these compounds are not natural products

156
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:19,490
the natural products are their acids the

157
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:22,889
plant makes THC acid

158
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:27,060
cannabidiol acid these are the compounds

159
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:29,459
that the plant makes we described the

160
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,849
many many years ago and synthesized them

161
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:35,370
but we never tested them for a simple

162
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:39,390
reason these compounds are not stable

163
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:42,149
the acids break down very easily so

164
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:44,370
there hasn't been a lot of work on the

165
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:46,110
contrary to cannot be dialed and the

166
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:48,929
reason is they are not stable so if

167
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,879
somebody does research on them who knows

168
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:53,489
what they are doing the research on is

169
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:58,200
that on the acid or is something that

170
00:08:53,490 --> 00:09:00,839
they had the the acid has broken down so

171
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,959
very few people who are interested in

172
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:08,010
the acids they're just a few papers not

173
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:11,489
too many now I thought we thought in the

174
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:14,189
lab that maybe he assets are important

175
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:16,680
by themselves but they're so we had to

176
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:19,200
stabilize them and by a simple chemical

177
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:21,719
reaction we stabilized them and made a

178
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,860
methyl ester whether the chemist amongst

179
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,600
you will know what it is

180
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,750
we made a methyl esters of these

181
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:31,889
compounds and the methyl esters turn out

182
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:35,669
to be stable completely stable so we

183
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:38,490
could analyze we could identify the

184
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:41,159
activity of these compounds and we've

185
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:44,278
been working on cannabidiol acid it

186
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:47,969
turns out it cannot be done acid is in

187
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:51,990
those studies that we have undertaken so

188
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:58,170
far it is more potent than cannabidiol

189
00:09:51,990 --> 00:10:01,039
itself so chances are that slowly to a

190
00:09:58,169 --> 00:10:04,379
certain extent never fully but slowly

191
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:07,649
cannabidiol as it as it methyl ester

192
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:10,789
will parallel cannot be dialed in its

193
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:14,940
activity because in many aspects it's

194
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:16,559
much more active and this is the

195
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,779
structure of it those of you who

196
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,750
remember chemistry will say that it's

197
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:23,578
the material ester and for example we

198
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,958
have already published that this

199
00:10:23,578 --> 00:10:30,838
cannabidiol acid if which is most stable

200
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:33,419
reduces depression-like behavior in two

201
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,180
models of animal depression of course we

202
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:37,649
cannot go into humans because of

203
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:39,750
regulations one has to go into animals

204
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:41,220
to a large extent and even if they are

205
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,440
natural product they have to be

206
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:47,519
investigated for toxicity and other

207
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:50,100
things but if we assume that most of the

208
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,740
things we see in animals in animal

209
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:56,220
models the parallel human models then

210
00:10:52,740 --> 00:11:01,049
this compound can be dialed acid methyl

211
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:05,040
ester will show activity stronger than

212
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:06,659
CBD itself we have a publication in

213
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:10,980
press which shows that

214
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:15,120
cannabidiol methyl ester is more potent

215
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:18,930
in in pain Louis pain to a much larger

216
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,970
extent we have seen as a slide shows

217
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:24,419
depression we have seen a few other

218
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:26,790
things and these will be published over

219
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:31,669
the next few years maybe over the next

220
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:34,588
few months so don't be surprised in

221
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:38,458
cannabidiol methyl ester starts

222
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:42,029
replacing cannabidiol slowly as the

223
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:49,068
natural cannabidiol of importance it

224
00:11:42,028 --> 00:11:53,429
does not cause the THC effects another

225
00:11:49,068 --> 00:11:56,849
effect that has gained interest is the

226
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:59,128
home to harsh effect we found and it has

227
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,980
been of course confirmed by many many

228
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:04,620
people both in animals and in humans

229
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:06,600
that some of the effects of THC of

230
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:11,209
cannabinoids it in quite a few

231
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:13,829
cannabinoids some of the effects are

232
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:18,088
potentiated by compounds that by

233
00:12:13,828 --> 00:12:21,299
themselves had no activity but they

234
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:23,009
potentiate the activity of THC and we

235
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:26,789
call this down to Roger effect and

236
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:29,639
although it doesn't one does not see

237
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:30,958
that in all effects of THC or all

238
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:34,350
effects cannabinoids

239
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:37,469
many of the effects have this entourage

240
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:41,339
effect so things become very complicated

241
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:44,009
if somebody wants to put THC as an

242
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:47,819
extract of CBD is an extract one has

243
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:51,180
also to know what are the compounds that

244
00:12:47,818 --> 00:12:54,509
are present there together with these

245
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:57,568
two compounds so we can have a sample

246
00:12:54,509 --> 00:13:01,919
that contains a certain percentage of

247
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:03,509
these central compounds and another one

248
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,299
that has the same percentage at the

249
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:09,169
other activities are somewhat different

250
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:12,708
so we shall have to develop

251
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:15,990
we shall have to develop analytical

252
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:18,419
procedures at least for most of the

253
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,700
compounds that are present in cannabis

254
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:24,689
in order to explain the active

255
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:26,850
and not to sell compounds with a certain

256
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:29,430
percentage another compound another

257
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:32,220
extract with the same percentage and yet

258
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:35,909
they are quite different we have to show

259
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,590
ultimately what are the rest of the

260
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:40,709
compounds of some of the rest of the

261
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:43,139
compounds that are around so this is

262
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:45,810
down to Rutherford and we have to take

263
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:49,620
into account and to rouse effects all

264
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:52,949
the time now okay a few words about THC

265
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:55,320
yeah most of you are aware of that has

266
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:58,500
to do with pain in nausea vomitting

267
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:01,260
sleep anxiety appetite quite a few other

268
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:06,259
things and Cathy 8 years you know has

269
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:09,090
been a found a approved by many of them

270
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:11,700
bodies in many countries in the US and

271
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:14,730
other countries and it is a approved

272
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:17,640
drug a minor drug and the reason for

273
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:19,680
that is that people prefer the extract

274
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:23,549
possibly because of the entourage effect

275
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:26,250
rather than THC itself so THC has been

276
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:28,740
on the market not a major drug I've been

277
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:31,830
told that it's sold in the u.s. between

278
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:39,210
100 and 200 million dollars which for a

279
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:42,870
major drug is nowhere there one thing

280
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:47,030
that people have not investigated very

281
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:50,340
thoroughly is depression and THC shows

282
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:52,529
significantly antidepressant effect but

283
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,690
the other compounds like cannot be Roman

284
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:56,730
for example show the same effect a

285
00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:00,230
little bit at higher doses but they show

286
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:04,710
the same effect so we should know what's

287
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:06,810
being sold exactly whether it is THC but

288
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:08,730
it's cannabis Roman or whether it's

289
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:12,479
other things now cannabis chroming maybe

290
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:14,820
not exactly the activist THC but it

291
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,750
doesn't call the side effect so maybe

292
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:21,060
people will be selling cannabis Roman

293
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:27,830
because of the lack of side effects that

294
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:32,759
people in pain don't want and we have

295
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:34,499
published the THC is also pretty

296
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:37,349
important in post round

297
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:40,589
we know that post trauma patients take

298
00:15:37,349 --> 00:15:43,349
cannabis in order to lower the effects

299
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:47,209
of puffs trauma we went ahead indeed a

300
00:15:43,349 --> 00:15:50,629
clinical trial and found that indeed low

301
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:53,908
amounts of THC which do not cause the hi

302
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:57,649
may help postural patients we had a

303
00:15:53,908 --> 00:16:00,658
group of about 12 patients a few

304
00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:07,458
soldiers a few women that had been raped

305
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:10,739
a few patients that had PTSD because of

306
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:13,108
car accident and we found it in

307
00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:19,168
essentially all the effects of post

308
00:16:13,109 --> 00:16:22,709
trauma THC helped in the effect didn't

309
00:16:19,168 --> 00:16:25,528
disappear they were easier to go around

310
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:28,288
with and the best effect wasn't sleep

311
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:30,629
post trauma patients do not sleep well

312
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:32,698
they are afraid to go to sleep because

313
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:35,938
in the middle of the night I wake up

314
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:38,158
with a trauma happening again and that's

315
00:16:35,938 --> 00:16:40,438
why they are afraid to go to sleep at

316
00:16:38,158 --> 00:16:44,879
they don't sleep well well we found that

317
00:16:40,438 --> 00:16:47,158
with THC low doses they they sleep much

318
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:51,139
better and this is one of the reasons

319
00:16:47,158 --> 00:16:53,999
post trauma patients do take cannabis

320
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:58,318
but let's go on with this

321
00:16:53,999 --> 00:17:00,449
cannabidiol actions and of course I'll

322
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:03,328
start with epilepsy because it has been

323
00:17:00,448 --> 00:17:08,398
approved now this is a paper you can see

324
00:17:03,328 --> 00:17:13,230
that we published 1980 which is almost

325
00:17:08,398 --> 00:17:15,298
40 years ago we found when initials in

326
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:18,449
collaboration with colleagues and

327
00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:21,720
friends in South America we found in

328
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:25,230
animals as was previously noted in the

329
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:28,139
literature for 2000 years that cannabis

330
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:31,079
Watson epilepsy so we looked at

331
00:17:28,138 --> 00:17:34,199
cannabidiol in first in animals and then

332
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:37,829
went to humans we did that and about 12

333
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,528
patients or 15 patients and we saw that

334
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:41,519
in most of the patients it affected

335
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:46,500
positively

336
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:48,460
the epilepsy most of them had very few

337
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,500
attacks a few had

338
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:54,430
much less attacks and only one was not

339
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:57,789
affected so we published that and we

340
00:17:54,430 --> 00:18:03,100
thought that maybe maybe it will be used

341
00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:05,230
that people will do larger trials and it

342
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:08,919
will be introduced as a drug nothing

343
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:12,420
happened for almost 30 years then pair

344
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:16,360
of parents in the u.s. discovered that

345
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:20,620
plants containing large amounts of

346
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:21,939
cannabidiol help with the epilepsy of

347
00:18:20,619 --> 00:18:24,849
their children and children sometimes

348
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,920
have terrible epilepsies 20 attacks a

349
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:29,289
day or something and but the kappa b

350
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,940
dial helped and they were going to one

351
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:34,210
of the states where kind of when

352
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:36,700
cannabis was legal and maybe some of

353
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:39,519
them had known about a paper now why did

354
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,620
we have to wait for 30 years

355
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,450
thousands of children thousands of

356
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:46,529
patients could have been helped

357
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:49,690
definitely children but because of

358
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:51,099
possibly legal problems possibly of

359
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:55,029
other problems

360
00:18:51,099 --> 00:19:01,289
nobody had taken up the information that

361
00:18:55,029 --> 00:19:05,649
was in the literature now a once parents

362
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:09,639
saw that cannabis with a lot of

363
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:13,330
cannabidiol helps there was a pressure

364
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:15,730
on the US authorities and a big trial

365
00:19:13,329 --> 00:19:19,210
was approved in the US it's very

366
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:21,400
difficult to get kind of clinical trials

367
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:24,069
with cannabis but this one was approved

368
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:27,550
because of social pressure and it turned

369
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:29,859
out to be extremely positive with

370
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:32,519
parallel what we did but it was done in

371
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:36,969
children was the need in hundreds of

372
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:40,289
children and now cannabidiol under the

373
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:45,220
name of hepa dialects is approved as a

374
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:48,359
drug in epilepsy why why was that done

375
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,360
thirty years ago

376
00:19:52,660 --> 00:20:00,680
we we had found that cannabidiol is

377
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:02,810
active in outer immune diseases how the

378
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,900
immune diseases or diseases and which

379
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:09,799
the body for many reasons some of which

380
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:11,390
we don't know attacks itself and there

381
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:14,240
are a lot of outer immune disease is now

382
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:17,120
a disease which is close to the outer

383
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:22,069
immune diseases is the graft-versus-host

384
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:25,399
disease sometimes in cancer patients the

385
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:27,139
bone marrow has to be replaced and when

386
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,690
the bone marries replaced the body

387
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,880
doesn't like it and it may attack it and

388
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:34,610
the bone marrow itself may attacked

389
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:38,570
about it and the patient suffers

390
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:41,659
sometimes suffers very very much but

391
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:44,629
this is essentially how to immune

392
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:48,440
reaction so a colleague of mine dr.

393
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:50,930
Yasser hoon went ahead the collaboration

394
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:54,640
we had went ahead and started giving

395
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:57,769
pure cannabidiol to patients with

396
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:03,740
graft-versus-host disease and he was

397
00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:06,589
very glad to note that yes in most of

398
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:09,049
the patients which had a relatively mild

399
00:21:06,589 --> 00:21:17,259
disease then this is called the two to

400
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:19,849
four great disease 40% previously had

401
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:23,140
graft-versus-host disease when they were

402
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:29,980
taking cannabidiol this went down to 12%

403
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:31,310
those that had a real real bad disease

404
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,370
GVHD

405
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:38,210
which was previously 10% and a few even

406
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:42,829
died went down to about 5% so here we

407
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:47,630
have an a drug cannabidiol which can be

408
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:50,419
used in this anti-cancer treatment and

409
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:54,950
it is being developed as a drug a

410
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:58,460
company has is going ahead with the CBD

411
00:21:54,950 --> 00:22:01,100
and GVHD and if I think it's now in

412
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:03,799
Phase two and chances are it will be in

413
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:04,939
phase three shortly so let's hope that

414
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:11,329
within a year or two

415
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:13,430
we shall have a drug CBD as a potent GBH

416
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:14,779
drug which there are no drugs other

417
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:17,930
drugs at a moment

418
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:22,460
now this schizophrenia now I mentioned

419
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:25,400
that because it was developed mostly in

420
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,799
Germany we had shown again with my good

421
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,019
friends in South America that it helps

422
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:32,750
in a very few patients we've published

423
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:34,730
that many years ago we had given CBD to

424
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,890
a young woman who had terrible

425
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:39,910
schizophrenia and it helped her over

426
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:43,190
three months and never came in Germany

427
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:47,120
decided to go head and he made a

428
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:48,890
relatively large or larger trial and he

429
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:50,869
gave it to patients that nothing was

430
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:56,660
helping them anymore schizophrenic

431
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:59,179
patients and he found that CBD was an

432
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:02,090
excellent drug he compared it to one of

433
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:06,890
the drugs that are already being used I

434
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:09,139
am if sulfide so pride and this drug

435
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:11,600
which is a good drug has side effects

436
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:13,880
now cannabidiol and the drugs are

437
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:17,029
already being used have the same

438
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:19,460
activity except that cannabidiol cause

439
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:21,170
no side effects many schizophrenic

440
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,329
patients don't want to take that and

441
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:25,519
histories of Renick drugs because of the

442
00:23:23,329 --> 00:23:28,639
side effects chances are that

443
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:32,389
cannabidiol can be can replace these

444
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:35,210
drugs unfortunately the amounts of

445
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:37,820
cannabidiol are very high about 800

446
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:40,819
milligrams per day that's quite high but

447
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:43,339
maybe just maybe with the new drugs what

448
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:47,000
I was studying about a methyl ester we

449
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:48,679
can go down to much lower doses so these

450
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,500
are developing that we shall see in the

451
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:55,789
future but I hope that even now

452
00:23:53,500 --> 00:24:00,319
schizophrenic patients will be

453
00:23:55,789 --> 00:24:03,589
administered cannabidiol the amounts are

454
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:07,519
very high about 800 milligrams a day but

455
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:11,419
it is definitely worth it and chances

456
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:13,970
are that cannabidiol will be approved as

457
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,620
a drug again schizophrenia I'm not sure

458
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:17,779
that it is approved in any country at

459
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:18,829
the moment I know that in Israel it is

460
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:20,808
being discussed

461
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:22,819
we're having a meeting next week with

462
00:24:20,808 --> 00:24:24,888
the heads of the Ministry of Health and

463
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:30,369
I'm trying to push

464
00:24:24,888 --> 00:24:30,369
cannabidiol as a anti schizophrenic drug

465
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:36,620
this is what I was telling you about

466
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:39,970
that cannabidiol was compared to a me so

467
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:42,798
pride and it also causes some of them

468
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:46,249
it's better in some of the side effects

469
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:49,429
it causes less weight gain it causes no

470
00:24:46,249 --> 00:24:53,118
changes in estrogen and testosterone and

471
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:57,460
it causes a lot of the different effect

472
00:24:53,118 --> 00:25:01,788
that the unpleasant effect that the

473
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:07,999
present drug and so pride is causing so

474
00:25:01,788 --> 00:25:10,210
we have probably well I believe that we

475
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:12,618
shall have cannabidiol Zante

476
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:15,590
schizophrenia drug within the next year

477
00:25:12,618 --> 00:25:18,918
or two and these are some of the

478
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:21,769
symptoms that the present drug causes it

479
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:25,749
caused because muscle spasms can cause

480
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:27,829
slowness of movement tremor and some

481
00:25:25,749 --> 00:25:31,850
other unpleasant types

482
00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:34,788
now one thing another disease that we've

483
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:37,819
been working on is diabetes type 1 again

484
00:25:34,788 --> 00:25:40,819
it is an autoimmune disease the body for

485
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:45,288
reason that we don't know attacks those

486
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:47,359
cells that produce insulin and the

487
00:25:45,288 --> 00:25:50,118
patient usually that's seen in children

488
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:53,118
so diabetes type 1 is a pediatric

489
00:25:50,118 --> 00:25:56,028
disease these children don't have enough

490
00:25:53,118 --> 00:26:00,439
insulin and they're sick sometimes very

491
00:25:56,028 --> 00:26:03,589
sick we found that the cannabidiol is

492
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:06,110
extremely helpful and in animals at

493
00:26:03,589 --> 00:26:08,749
least we have not done that in humans we

494
00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:13,459
don't have the permits yet we have seen

495
00:26:08,749 --> 00:26:17,569
that in animals only 5% of the cells

496
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:20,499
that produce insulin remain intact those

497
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:23,990
that are given cannabidiol we see that

498
00:26:20,499 --> 00:26:26,659
77% of the cells that produce insulin

499
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:30,079
remain intact so here we have a major

500
00:26:26,659 --> 00:26:32,540
improvement and unfortunately although

501
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:37,250
we publish that quite a few years ago

502
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:40,180
this disease has not been for this

503
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:45,680
treatment for the disease has not been

504
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:48,890
looked to into in humans why we can't do

505
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:50,509
everything and apparently very few

506
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:53,330
people are interested although it is a

507
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:56,299
major disease and a disease from which

508
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:59,119
quite a few particularly children suffer

509
00:26:56,299 --> 00:27:03,649
so any of you has enough pressure in

510
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:06,500
your countries to have an diabetes type

511
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:15,940
one clinical trial with people

512
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:21,019
cannabidiol go ahead now Oh almost all

513
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:24,230
drugs from natural products are sold not

514
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:26,359
as the drugs and themselves but as the

515
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:29,089
derivative and the reason for that are

516
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:31,309
the reasons quite a lot first of all on

517
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:38,000
the natural product the patent is not

518
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:39,829
very strong and by making a small small

519
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,019
derivative of chemical derivative

520
00:27:39,829 --> 00:27:44,179
usually one can get more potent

521
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:48,440
compounds and compounds that are better

522
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:50,420
from in many ways for example today you

523
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,210
cannot buy insulin

524
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:55,970
you cannot buy penicillin as such you

525
00:27:53,210 --> 00:28:00,950
can buy a derivative of penicillin in a

526
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:03,289
drugstore or let's go into cortisone

527
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:06,950
another major homo you cannot buy

528
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:09,349
cortisone in a drug store you can buy

529
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:13,549
derivatives of cortisone and these

530
00:28:09,349 --> 00:28:16,699
derivatives may be sold about five or

531
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:19,159
six billion dollars a year so chances

532
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:21,650
are that cannot be died within the next

533
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:24,560
few years will be on the market is a

534
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:26,720
derivative not that cannabidiol itself

535
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,819
but as a derivative and here is a

536
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,789
derivative that we have published and a

537
00:28:28,819 --> 00:28:34,669
company is developing it and this

538
00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:37,940
derivative is a peril of the activity of

539
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:40,759
CBD that is somewhat more potent so

540
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:43,700
chances are that in the near future or

541
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:45,640
the distant future we shall have both

542
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:50,150
cannabidiol and

543
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:54,259
derivatives now let me go into the face

544
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:58,640
- of cannabis research and this is the

545
00:28:54,259 --> 00:29:00,980
compound that we make ourselves for many

546
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:05,530
reasons and some of the reasons we

547
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:08,930
brought into the literature it was

548
00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:11,289
obvious that cannabidiol acts on

549
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:14,360
something in the body such as

550
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:16,970
specifically which may be a receptor and

551
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:21,139
so a group in the u.s. found the

552
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:23,870
receptor protein in the body that THC

553
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:27,470
binds to it and it starts all the

554
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:29,659
reactions so but we don't have receptors

555
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:32,720
because there is a plant out there we

556
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:35,570
have receptors because we make compounds

557
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:39,400
that will stimulate these receptors so

558
00:29:35,569 --> 00:29:42,189
we went ahead looking for compounds and

559
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:45,259
this receptor was found in all these

560
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:47,120
places that you can see called basal

561
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:50,210
ganglia all these places that have to do

562
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:53,059
with movement control and movement

563
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:55,190
coordination and cognitive function all

564
00:29:53,059 --> 00:30:00,819
these things that people know happen

565
00:29:55,190 --> 00:30:03,650
with THC so this receptor was obviously

566
00:30:00,819 --> 00:30:05,779
important and central so we started

567
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:08,720
looking for the compounds that we make

568
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:12,529
or animals make that activated

569
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,700
paralleled the activity of THC and after

570
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:16,700
quite a lot of work

571
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:18,440
we found two compounds one of them we

572
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,840
called the nand amide and the second one

573
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,330
is known as 2 AG which are chemically

574
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:28,220
completely different but have the same

575
00:30:23,329 --> 00:30:33,769
activity and the same the same activity

576
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:35,990
s THC you can see if you're forgotten

577
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:38,210
your chemistry did these two compounds

578
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:40,279
and an amide into AG which animals

579
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:42,680
produce and we produce completely

580
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:45,109
different chemically from THC but they

581
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:47,630
have the same physical properties there

582
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:49,609
are lipid they dissolve only in lipids

583
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:52,130
not in water they bind to the same

584
00:30:49,609 --> 00:30:55,039
receptor and so on so Ananda might and

585
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:56,929
to AG have been discussed widely in the

586
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,629
literature there's thousands of

587
00:30:56,929 --> 00:31:02,259
publications on

588
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:05,190
Anandi might and 2ag and these compounds

589
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:08,079
are central in the so called

590
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:11,950
endocannabinoid system which consists of

591
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:15,038
the receptors there two of them the two

592
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:18,909
compounds the enzymes that break down

593
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:20,919
the compound these compound Oh help us

594
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:24,009
synthesize them and of course the 18

595
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:26,860
cannabidiol so there has been a lot of

596
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:31,929
theoretical work or work that has very

597
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:34,689
little relation to marketing and so on

598
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:37,210
for a simple reason although we

599
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:39,759
discovered Ananda mite and a little bit

600
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:42,429
later to AG and nanda byte has never

601
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:45,878
never been administered to a human and

602
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:49,210
again because of mostly legal reasons

603
00:31:45,878 --> 00:31:52,028
it's not toxic it's made by the body if

604
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:55,240
we compare that with let's say insulin

605
00:31:52,028 --> 00:31:59,138
insulin was discovered 200 years ago and

606
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:01,210
in Canada and within six months it

607
00:31:59,138 --> 00:32:04,089
became a drug within a year it became a

608
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:07,389
drug very useful drug even today people

609
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:10,918
use insulin as a drug Morris now why

610
00:32:07,388 --> 00:32:14,829
Ananda might which has outstanding

611
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:17,830
medical properties never been used legal

612
00:32:14,829 --> 00:32:19,960
reasons patent problems and so on so

613
00:32:17,829 --> 00:32:21,970
this is strange because we know in

614
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,940
schizophrenia for example when

615
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:26,980
cannabidiol is administered the main

616
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:30,250
effect is that Ananda might

617
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:33,099
concentrations go up and if Ananda might

618
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:35,378
concentrations go up maybe it is Ananda

619
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:37,298
by that's helping not cannabidiol but a

620
00:32:35,378 --> 00:32:40,019
nanomite indirectly there are many other

621
00:32:37,298 --> 00:32:43,210
diseases that an endermite has to do so

622
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:48,579
it's unbelievable but it has never been

623
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:51,190
given to a human and now in animals it

624
00:32:48,579 --> 00:32:54,628
has been looked the endocannabinoid

625
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:58,230
system and it has been found to be

626
00:32:54,628 --> 00:33:01,359
involved in a huge number of

627
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:04,269
physiological effects starting from

628
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:06,579
anxiety and appetite this and so on and

629
00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:09,009
so forth we can see the mood movement

630
00:33:06,579 --> 00:33:11,589
stress if I were to prepare a new slide

631
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:12,319
this is a slide of two years ago I would

632
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:15,679
have

633
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:18,379
twice as many physiological things

634
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,840
happening so it is extremely important

635
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:22,970
and chances are that at some point an

636
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:27,769
endermite or a derivative of an

637
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:29,059
endermite will become a drug I'll give

638
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:31,210
you just two examples the

639
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:34,069
neuroprotection

640
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:36,590
we tried with a colleague vows to see

641
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:43,789
whether these compounds are involved in

642
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:46,250
Europe protection and we tried out that

643
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:50,539
person and he must I don't believe that

644
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:54,710
anybody any the a of our friends would

645
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:59,200
have volunteered to have some kind of

646
00:33:54,710 --> 00:34:07,900
brain attack as we didn't pull mice and

647
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:11,418
we saw that after such a when they were

648
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:13,639
given a small attack on the brain not a

649
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:17,539
very strong one as a matter of fact

650
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:18,829
within a couple of weeks they went back

651
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:21,789
to be completely normal

652
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:23,980
we saw the two AG one of the two

653
00:34:21,789 --> 00:34:26,929
endocannabinoids goes up tremendously

654
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:29,929
now he's dead because the brain being

655
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:32,840
damaged didn't know what was doing was

656
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:35,599
that some kind of a protection so we

657
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:37,669
synthesized a lot of to AG and gave to

658
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,969
animals and compared to animals that not

659
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:43,099
given to AG and we saw that yes the two

660
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:46,279
AG one of the endocannabinoids is a

661
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:48,079
potent protectant if we gave that to the

662
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,240
people to know how to look at these

663
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,819
things in the brain and we saw that in

664
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:55,759
the controls we had a certain amount of

665
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:57,170
damage the white part that you see those

666
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:02,570
that were given to AG the

667
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:06,170
endocannabinoid had 50% less so probably

668
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:09,440
at some point to AG will be developed as

669
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:11,510
a drug against brain damage there is no

670
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:16,039
drug at the moment quite a few people

671
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:18,380
get kind that kind of damage and there

672
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:20,269
is nothing to do with that I mean there

673
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:22,720
are no drugs available today that can

674
00:35:20,269 --> 00:35:22,719
help

675
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:36,760
now one thing that has been found quite

676
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:44,649
recently again in note no South America

677
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:49,359
is that cb1 receptors are not only known

678
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:51,068
to to be of two to lower anxiety but

679
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:51,880
quite a few of the drugs that we use

680
00:35:51,068 --> 00:35:54,429
today

681
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:57,640
and we are not sure of their activity or

682
00:35:54,429 --> 00:36:00,368
we have wrongly assigned some of their

683
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:02,348
activity is due to the end to the

684
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:06,369
cannabinoid system and there is for

685
00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:09,430
example xanax alprazolam which is an

686
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:11,829
anti-anxiety drug a well-known widely

687
00:36:09,429 --> 00:36:14,230
used actually it works to the

688
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:16,390
cannabinoid receptors so this is the

689
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:20,190
case chances are that people will

690
00:36:16,389 --> 00:36:22,838
develop additional drugs in this respect

691
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:26,980
now I mentioned that there are two

692
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:29,289
receptors cb1 and cb2 this activation of

693
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:31,780
the cb1 receptor causes the well-known

694
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:35,980
THC activities the high and so on

695
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:40,839
the second one the cb2 is does not cause

696
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:43,750
it is it is a protective receptor and I

697
00:36:40,838 --> 00:36:46,389
know some companies in Switzerland at

698
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:50,108
least one company is developing drugs

699
00:36:46,389 --> 00:36:53,920
based on the second receptor that does

700
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:56,650
not cause these side-effects which are

701
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,230
not of importance to pharmaceutical

702
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:01,990
company they act only in the cb2

703
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:04,990
receptor not on the cb1 receptor and

704
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:06,759
acting on in the cb2 receptor with

705
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:09,308
compound that we have made a compound

706
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:11,650
that the companies have made these cb2

707
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:19,599
receptors are involved in a huge number

708
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:23,338
of protective mechanisms in heart

709
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,960
problems in atherosclerosis in pain

710
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:28,920
neurodegenerative diseases again if

711
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:32,588
these companies succeed in producing

712
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:35,320
compounds and evaluating them chances

713
00:37:32,588 --> 00:37:41,820
are that we shall have drugs that

714
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:45,010
are not CBD are not THC but are based on

715
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:47,289
cb2 receptors but I don't have the time

716
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:49,750
to go into that because people a long

717
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:52,570
time here are compounds that have that

718
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:56,320
are specifically acting in the CB 2 and

719
00:37:52,570 --> 00:38:00,309
so this is a few words on the endogenous

720
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:02,740
cannabinoids system which is phase 2 of

721
00:38:00,309 --> 00:38:07,049
research at present we are working on

722
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:09,849
phase 3 and phase 3 research is

723
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:14,620
something else entirely

724
00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:17,079
I mentioned the nanda might those of you

725
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:18,940
who are chemists will see that the nanda

726
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:22,599
might is a throughout a simple compound

727
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:25,599
it is a fatty acid bound to an amino

728
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:28,319
acid we have about 20 fatty acids and

729
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:32,319
about 20 amino acids in our body

730
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:35,320
now the power body is lazy if it knows

731
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:38,019
how to make an endermite taking a fatty

732
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:41,230
acid and binding it to an amino acid why

733
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:43,119
not take the other fatty acids in the

734
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:45,369
other amino acids and make additional

735
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,920
compound make use of them so it won't

736
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:52,750
have to spend energy those are he has

737
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:54,280
the machinery to do that and yes we

738
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:58,119
found that this is exactly what's

739
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:01,240
happening how did we go into that we saw

740
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:03,759
that in brain injury there is a brain

741
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:07,089
injury part of the brain injury causes

742
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:09,700
effects and all kinds of transmitters

743
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:12,850
motivated so on and ultimately it causes

744
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:14,079
neuronal and cell death but and these

745
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:17,049
are the things I was telling you

746
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:20,110
previously but it also causes brain

747
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:22,360
injury can cause vasoconstriction the

748
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:26,410
blood vessels constrict this is not

749
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:29,680
healthy so the body tries to prevent

750
00:39:26,409 --> 00:39:34,779
that and we saw that cannabis extract of

751
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:37,359
cannabis or can help with that and if we

752
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:40,420
take the brain or another animal and

753
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:42,640
extract it and give it it also helps

754
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:46,030
with the vasoconstriction so there is a

755
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:49,250
compound in our body which helps with

756
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:51,230
vasoconstriction and so we

757
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:54,619
in the head looking for that we didn't

758
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:56,599
know that the it has to anything that we

759
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:58,159
tend to cannabinoids we just went ahead

760
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:00,920
looking for the compounds it could be

761
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:05,809
anything and after quite a lot of work

762
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:09,530
we found that our body helps with vessel

763
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:11,960
dilation by making a third compound like

764
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:14,560
can and amide but it does not cause any

765
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:18,440
of the effects of an endermite it just

766
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:21,829
helps with a vasoconstriction it dilates

767
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:25,340
the blood vessels so this is something

768
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:28,670
that our body makes in order to prevent

769
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:32,780
vasoconstriction which is due to brain

770
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:35,869
damage if we block this system the brain

771
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:38,840
damage is much much higher so here we

772
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:43,029
have a drug a cannabinoid cannabinoid

773
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:46,610
like drug which has to do with

774
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:49,280
vasoconstriction vasodilation and again

775
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:51,500
I repeat myself all the time maybe there

776
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,320
will be it will be used as a drug but

777
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:59,809
this is not the only thing another thing

778
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:04,640
that happens is with bones again we this

779
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:07,570
was a research project which we didn't

780
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:10,849
think has anything to do it cannabinoids

781
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:15,430
the background of our work and bones was

782
00:41:10,849 --> 00:41:21,349
that it was well known it was known that

783
00:41:15,429 --> 00:41:23,750
women after the age of 50 55 when all

784
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:26,000
the hormones had changed and when all

785
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:31,900
the hormones don't work the way they did

786
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:35,900
previously women should have a lot of

787
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:38,960
osteoporosis which they do most of them

788
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:41,900
but the osteoporosis in women in a

789
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:45,590
Mediterranean region is much lower than

790
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:48,200
the osteoporosis in in the note in no

791
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:51,289
way let's say or even in the Berlin now

792
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:53,960
we thought why what's the reason and

793
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:56,920
there is a suggestion in the literature

794
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:59,090
that this is because of the olive oil

795
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,610
that's being used around the

796
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:02,840
Mediterranean so we looked at the olive

797
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:04,789
oil and he didn't do any

798
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:07,280
thing but maybe we said it's a

799
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:10,009
derivative so derivative in our body

800
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,530
makes and we were quite a lot on and

801
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:17,960
this project and ultimately we found it

802
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:21,680
yes our body makes a compound which is

803
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:23,570
closely related chemically to Ananda

804
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:25,309
mite which again is strange we didn't

805
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:26,769
expect anything like that we thought

806
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:29,840
that that's a completely different

807
00:42:26,769 --> 00:42:34,369
research problem but we saw that our

808
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:37,640
body women's body of course produces the

809
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:41,000
compound closely related to an and amide

810
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:42,829
and it blocks or stoper OSIS not

811
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,250
completely but it blocks it very well

812
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:47,809
indeed

813
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:51,559
and doing that it helps again it is not

814
00:42:47,809 --> 00:42:56,509
an endocannabinoid it is not a THC but

815
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:59,150
it is closely related so again a company

816
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:02,270
has taken up this compound which is

817
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:06,410
again a fatty acid bound to an amino

818
00:43:02,269 --> 00:43:10,340
acid closely related to an an amide and

819
00:43:06,409 --> 00:43:12,859
when given to mice works extremely well

820
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:14,900
well we're not mice I hope that it will

821
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:16,940
work in humans when it is given I

822
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:20,150
believe that it will then I will just

823
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:22,880
show you one slide most of the drugs

824
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:26,269
that were used again the osteoporosis

825
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:29,300
nowadays most of the drugs block the

826
00:43:26,269 --> 00:43:32,719
destruction of the bones they don't

827
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:36,500
cause the bones to be built up again in

828
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:39,349
this case the compounded animals make

829
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:41,150
that we make which is closely related to

830
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:44,779
an an amide it is part of the

831
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:48,019
endocannabinoid system this compound not

832
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:51,260
only blocks the destruction of the bones

833
00:43:48,019 --> 00:43:54,829
but even helps the bones grow up you can

834
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:57,260
see in this slide the first green thing

835
00:43:54,829 --> 00:44:02,119
is what the bones are at the moment

836
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:04,130
after the ovaries and everything else

837
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:07,099
has been taken out of the mice in order

838
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:10,430
to parallel what happens in women after

839
00:44:07,099 --> 00:44:13,639
the age of 55 there are the bones of the

840
00:44:10,429 --> 00:44:16,879
animals went down and is the red thing

841
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:20,719
we see it has gone down and they have

842
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:24,650
strong and potent osteoporosis and when

843
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:28,899
we start after 40 45 days when we see

844
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:32,510
this when we start giving them the new

845
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:36,500
cannabinoid like compound we see that

846
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:40,180
the bones not only are not destructed

847
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:44,119
anymore they even go up Anna being re

848
00:44:40,179 --> 00:44:47,809
remodeled again rebuilt again so here we

849
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:51,589
have a typical example of the phase 3 of

850
00:44:47,809 --> 00:44:53,840
cannabinoid work namely fatty acids

851
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:57,140
bound to amino acids like in an and

852
00:44:53,840 --> 00:45:02,000
amide without compounds without psycho

853
00:44:57,139 --> 00:45:05,359
activity so here we have a example of

854
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:10,369
what talking about and I would like now

855
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:12,110
to summarize oh another thing that we're

856
00:45:10,369 --> 00:45:19,190
actually working at the moment it's

857
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:22,150
nicotine addiction we get addicted to

858
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:28,700
many compounds too many things including

859
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:31,730
drugs opium cocaine nicotine now our

860
00:45:28,699 --> 00:45:33,619
body looks at nicotine it's at any

861
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:37,369
addiction certainly also to nicotine

862
00:45:33,619 --> 00:45:41,299
addiction as a disease if it's a disease

863
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:43,909
then the body will try to block the

864
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:45,950
disease how does it block it well we

865
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:50,059
didn't know but we thought that maybe

866
00:45:45,949 --> 00:45:53,109
our body makes compounds that try to

867
00:45:50,059 --> 00:45:57,769
block the disease I would not go into

868
00:45:53,110 --> 00:46:01,490
details there it was a long story we in

869
00:45:57,769 --> 00:46:06,469
this case was a group for research labs

870
00:46:01,489 --> 00:46:08,959
ours came up with a suggestion a good

871
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:12,469
friend seen in the u.s. at Richmond

872
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:15,530
Virginia good friends in Canada and good

873
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:17,599
friends in Italy we sit together drink a

874
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:21,290
lot of coffee together and discuss how

875
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:25,369
to go ahead and together we went ahead

876
00:46:21,289 --> 00:46:30,639
looking how does the body fight nicotine

877
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:30,639
addiction and we found that

878
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:39,400
in a certain place in the brain a

879
00:46:34,539 --> 00:46:42,800
compound is formed which again is a

880
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:44,869
fatty acid bound to amino acid strangely

881
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,820
enough when we started we didn't have

882
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:49,429
the foggiest idea that this is going to

883
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:55,900
happen again we have an endocannabinoid

884
00:46:49,429 --> 00:47:00,710
like situation and this compound blocks

885
00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:03,380
an effect which is one of the models

886
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:05,480
it's called conditioned plays reference

887
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,220
it blocks one of the models of

888
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:10,309
prediction what is conditional Christ

889
00:47:07,219 --> 00:47:12,589
reference you put a mouse in the center

890
00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:14,840
on one hand you have the food with

891
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:17,059
nicotine the other hand for the in the

892
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:19,130
other side food without nicotine at the

893
00:47:17,059 --> 00:47:20,929
beginning they go 50 percent here 50

894
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:22,700
percent there then slowly they get

895
00:47:20,929 --> 00:47:24,230
addicted and go only to the food that

896
00:47:22,699 --> 00:47:27,199
has addiction and that's caused

897
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:31,369
condition place preference and we could

898
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:33,919
block not only the model the condition

899
00:47:31,369 --> 00:47:37,719
place preference but we could we could

900
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:40,070
block even then we draw symptoms when

901
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:42,049
people or mice and not give a nicotine

902
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:45,470
anymore and they are addicted they show

903
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:48,920
some kind of anxiety well that's what

904
00:47:45,469 --> 00:47:51,109
happened so it was try dosing morphine

905
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:54,920
it doesn't block morphine addiction but

906
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:57,440
it blocks that we draw symptoms so if it

907
00:47:54,920 --> 00:48:01,099
turns out to do the same in humans we

908
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:04,820
can maybe block we draw symptoms of

909
00:48:01,099 --> 00:48:07,099
nicotine withdrawal symptoms of morphine

910
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:08,870
which is a great thing after all you

911
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:11,119
know only in the u.s. there are about 65

912
00:48:08,869 --> 00:48:15,679
thousand people the diaphragm

913
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:23,150
morphine overdose so maybe we can help

914
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:25,929
many of those so just as a summary there

915
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:30,980
are three phases of cannabinoid research

916
00:48:25,929 --> 00:48:35,419
one of them has to do with the plants

917
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:37,269
THC CBD possibly other compounds the

918
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:39,650
other one has to do with the

919
00:48:37,269 --> 00:48:43,239
endocannabinoids which are involved in a

920
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:46,210
large number of physiological processes

921
00:48:43,239 --> 00:48:49,329
and within that story the the cb2

922
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:51,429
receptors which are specific for many

923
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:54,039
diseases did not cause the side-effects

924
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:58,149
and the third one is a huge number

925
00:48:54,039 --> 00:49:00,789
almost a hundred compounds that our body

926
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:03,579
makes and we know about the activity of

927
00:49:00,789 --> 00:49:07,779
about five or ten in chances are they'll

928
00:49:03,579 --> 00:49:11,679
see many more so cannabinoids in the

929
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:16,090
future in research in medicine certainly

930
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:20,489
in all the other commercial or

931
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:20,490
non-commercial aspect we shall be seeing

932
00:49:20,969 --> 00:49:26,589
people going ahead with plant

933
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:29,500
cannabinoids the main thing that's being

934
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:33,579
done today endogenous cannabinoids which

935
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:36,519
will probably be developed within the

936
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:38,980
next few years and Ananda might like

937
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:42,179
compounds which will take a little bit

938
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:44,740
more and I want to thank many of my

939
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:46,809
collaborators quite a lot all this work

940
00:49:44,739 --> 00:49:49,719
is being done with collaborators know

941
00:49:46,809 --> 00:49:52,119
the lab can do everything alone these

942
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:54,429
things have to be done in collaboration

943
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:57,910
and these are collaborators in Israel a

944
00:49:54,429 --> 00:50:00,190
lot of collaborators abroad we meet some

945
00:49:57,909 --> 00:50:05,559
with some of them and we discuss

946
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:08,980
problems from many different sides of

947
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:10,690
science and hopefully we have succeeded

948
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:14,139
in doing some things that may be

949
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:15,460
important and maybe we'll do some things

950
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:21,250
in the future as well

951
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:23,510
thank you yes yes one more time

952
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:28,199
dr. Michelle ah

953
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:32,340
man that was what the pine solution

954
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:34,109
already maybe we have time for one here

955
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:36,480
we have time for one question one

956
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:37,950
question maybe two please be brief we

957
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:42,690
don't we're running over already so

958
00:50:37,949 --> 00:50:45,029
please no stories just questions thank

959
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:48,420
you so much professor Michelle am i

960
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:51,180
making a nickel tea from Israel my

961
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:58,079
question is to but to the best of my

962
00:50:51,179 --> 00:51:01,589
knowledge only THC was shown to bind cb1

963
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:04,980
and cb2 with high affinity what do you

964
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:08,870
think is the mode of action of the other

965
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:13,170
phyto cannabinoids which we may not bind

966
00:51:08,869 --> 00:51:16,909
CB a cannabinoid receptors in high with

967
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:20,070
high affinity we have information about

968
00:51:16,909 --> 00:51:25,139
the mode of action of cannabidiol it

969
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:27,300
does not bind to the receptors it binds

970
00:51:25,139 --> 00:51:29,699
very weakly as an antagonist but not

971
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:33,300
significant it does quite a lot of other

972
00:51:29,699 --> 00:51:36,480
things and it but it effects a lot of

973
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:39,600
other systems and it is strange that we

974
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:43,769
see no side effect it affects and I will

975
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:46,980
not go into the whole list of mechanisms

976
00:51:43,769 --> 00:51:48,659
that are known for CB 2 it does all

977
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:50,490
these things and I'm surprised that we

978
00:51:48,659 --> 00:51:53,519
don't see any side effect but the fact

979
00:51:50,489 --> 00:51:55,109
is that it doesn't why does so many

980
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:58,320
things I'm not so sure

981
00:51:55,110 --> 00:52:01,349
one thing that people are looking at the

982
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:05,070
moment and it may may be very basic and

983
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:12,110
this is one of the few compounds that

984
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:17,640
acts on DNA itself mostly we drug we see

985
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:20,610
effects on the symptoms here has been

986
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:24,480
found that CBD acts on DNA

987
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:29,610
it changes the activity of the specific

988
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:32,280
DNA so maybe just maybe if we there is a

989
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:35,640
disease of some kind and this is due to

990
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:39,630
DNA producing something too much

991
00:52:35,639 --> 00:52:41,460
of it maybe what CBD does it goes to

992
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:45,210
that particular part of the DNA and

993
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:49,309
blocks it maybe there has been so work

994
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:52,110
in Italy which shows that it acts in

995
00:52:49,309 --> 00:52:56,340
psoriasis I believe they looked into it

996
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:59,070
acts under DNA so chances are that this

997
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:01,050
is the main activity but again this is

998
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:03,410
something that people are working on at

999
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:03,410
the moment

1000
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:13,079
hi a New Jersey wakati from Mehta farm

1001
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:16,019
labs Canada thank you so much for that

1002
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:17,759
interesting talk I'm sorry I can't can

1003
00:53:16,019 --> 00:53:20,659
you speak slowly and louder

1004
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,980
okay does CBDs two different

1005
00:53:20,659 --> 00:53:29,789
stereoisomer have different effects in

1006
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:32,039
the body CBD CBD is a compound which I

1007
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:35,039
would didn't go into it which has a

1008
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:38,309
mirror image there's the plus CBD in the

1009
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:40,739
- CBD the natural product is the - CBD

1010
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:42,539
very little work has been done on the

1011
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:45,029
mirror image and the plus CBD

1012
00:53:42,539 --> 00:53:47,699
surprisingly some work that we did a I

1013
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:52,710
think 30 years ago we found that some of

1014
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:55,169
the effects of the - CBD are also seen

1015
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:57,179
with the plus CBD which is unusual but

1016
00:53:55,170 --> 00:54:01,289
as I said since then nothing has been

1017
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:03,299
done on the plus CBD the plus THC also

1018
00:54:01,289 --> 00:54:05,639
does not cause the side effect does not

1019
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:10,980
cause the effects of THC but it has been

1020
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:12,719
shown that it lowers brain damage thank

1021
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:16,800
you thank you very much one more time

1022
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:21,029

1023
