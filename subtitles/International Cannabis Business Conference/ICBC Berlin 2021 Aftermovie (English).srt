1
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,080
I decided that we wanted to attend  the ICBC in Berlin specifically  

2
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:15,919
because the European market  is truly coming online.  

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,000
Germany is today the most important  market in the cannabis industry in Europe,  

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,839
and so coming to the capital of  Berlin with ICBC was a no-brainer.  

5
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,679
ICBC in Berlin - perfect match, it's perfect.  

6
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,160
When I think of Berlin, when I think  of Germany, I think of organized.  

7
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:47,679
I think of professional. I think of brave, and  ICBC delivered all of those things in spade.

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,840
I'm here at ICBC for three reasons:  

9
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,600
the first reason was to get as much  information as possible from the people  

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,560
that are already in the industry, hear from all  the success stories, hear from all the failure.

11
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:16,079
What ICBC has done is I've met  people in the finance industry,  

12
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,280
I've met people in the legal industry, I've  met people in the regulatory framework,  

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,920
and these people have been able to tell  us what's possible, what is not possible,  

14
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,439
what would work for a country like  Zimbabwe and what wouldn't work.

15
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,680
We want to craft a national cannabis master plan.  I've met the parties that can make that happen,  

16
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,760
and make it happen uh faster  than it would normally take.

17
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:55,759
ICBC, um, it is probably the best conference I've  ever attended, and I've been going to conferences  

18
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:03,600
since I was 12 years old. The reason why i  say that, is the growth. I grew in three days.  

19
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:11,840
I probably grew more than I have in the last  three years. The networking opportunities, uh,  

20
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:18,399
are just unparalleled. I've met people that  I wouldn't normally meet. I've had a chance  

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:26,080
to liaise with professionals in the industry  that there's no other way I would have had  

22
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:33,440
to see these people. I have access to billions  of dollars in funding right now because of  

23
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:39,280
coming to such a conference. So, I made  the sacrifice. ICBC is worth it for me,  

24
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:49,840
it's worth it for the people of Zimbabwe, and  we will reap the benefits of my presence here.

25
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,360
the ICBC after parties are always always fun  - what you expect from the cannabis industry,  

26
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,960
and always always elegant.  

27
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,680
We always get exactly what we expect, which  is it's a sophisticatedly professionally run  

28
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,840
conference, very rich attendance in terms of  diversity, as far as just people and cultures,  

29
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:30,480
but also the areas of the industry that are  represented - always very intelligent discussions.
