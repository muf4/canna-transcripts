3
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:12,899

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,059
very interesting panel because we have a

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,679
very diverse set of panelists up here

6
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,500
hopefully I'll just kick it over to them

7
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:21,179

we're here and I'll impact it a bit more

31
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,118
as we as we get into things thanks real

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,118
quick I don't know if you guys worry

33
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:24,540
guys based uh so I'm based in London but

34
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,739
we have team in Paris and some advisors

35
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,280
in the US

36
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:32,879
Denver Colorado and uh czechia

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,140
I'm in Johannesburg so to wrap this

38
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:35,879
whole thing up for the end of the day

39
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,340
and again talking about maybe where this

40
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:39,539
is going in the future uh and as we've

41
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,719
talked about earlier today there's

42
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,060
certainly stigma remains and the

43
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,340
question to the panelists then is you

44
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,259
know what may be major events or what

45
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,180
they see in their business model is

46
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,819
going to change that mindset whether a

47
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,040
short term or long-term uh so starting

48
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:57,539
with you ollie too that you know there's

49
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,880
been a lot of capital put in this

50
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,320
industry and as a result of some of the

51
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:03,420
blow-ups that we've talked about a lot

52
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:06,059
today a lot of that capital is going to

53
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,618
still staying on the sidelines so we

54
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,020
want to talk about the stigma as it

55
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:12,060
relates to operations as it relates to

56
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,400
markets as it relates to revenue as it

57
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,780
relates to Capital Ollie do you want to

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,879
kick off that

59
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,680
I think

60
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:21,000
it's interesting hearing the talks today

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,560
because I think

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,060
obviously there's a lot of pessimism

63
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,459
there's a lot of frustration about where

64
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,800
we are today and frankly it's totally

65
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,360
reasonable you know we're in a a pretty

66
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,219
depressed state of the market but

67
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,080
ultimately

68
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:37,378
it's not surprising I think you know

69
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,660
this is an emerging sector this is a

70
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:42,060
novel therapeutic admittedly it's been

71
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,979
used for generations and generations but

72
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,860
coupled with the stigma that's been

73
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:50,098
surrounding it for so long you know it's

74
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,140
it's unsurprising that there was a

75
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:55,378
resistance to it being legalized

76
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:57,779
and then an extremely overhyped hype

77
00:02:55,378 --> 00:02:59,459
cycle when it eventually was

78
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,959
and now I think we're in a sort of

79
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,300
strange

80
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,640
limbo situation whereby

81
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,900
in reality although everything does feel

82
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:08,899
very much appreciated

83
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,500
in terms of True Value it's I don't

84
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:15,680
think the valuations of today are

85
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,878
actually particularly

86
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,379
misaligned with what there is in the

87
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:20,818
market

88
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:24,239
um the reason why I say that is because

89
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:27,000
I think perhaps we got used to the

90
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,360
over-excitement of you know the late

91
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,139
teens of the last 10 years

92
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,140
and

93
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:39,479
realistically the only way was down and

94
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:42,658
had it not come down yet instead of us

95
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:44,280
being pessimistic here about the the

96
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:45,959
current low evaluations the current lack

97
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,000
of capital we'll probably all be

98
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,098
terrified about the impending implosion

99
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,439
that would inevitably come

100
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:54,479
so for that reason you know weird as a

101
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:57,359
capital are actually very optimistic now

102
00:03:54,479 --> 00:04:00,359
I think we're we're at a stage where

103
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,799
valuations are reasonable where a lot of

104
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,819
the chaff has been washed out of the

105
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:06,239
market

106
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:07,619
and where ultimately the true benefits

107
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,939
of the sector are still there to be

108
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,980
realized nothing has changed

109
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:12,479
fundamentally about what these products

110
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:14,818
can do for consumers and what they can

111
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,298
do for patients and now it's up to us to

112
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:17,298
realize that

113
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,819
well I think I'm going to shake things

114
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,099
up a little bit

115
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:25,019
um so I'm in the hemp space we don't

116
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,240
have any of these problems we can do

117
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:30,599
interstate commerce we export to 26

118
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:34,019
countries last month we sold 600 million

119
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,360
10 million milligram doses

120
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:38,099
um so we don't have the restrictions

121
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,660
that the Cannabis Market has to go

122
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,680
through you know all these cannabis and

123
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,720
hemp

124
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,400
um I bank at Bank of America they like

125
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,040
my money

126
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,239
um so we we don't see it as much and

127
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,000
maybe it's a breath of fresh air for

128
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,519
everybody else maybe not uh uh but we

129
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,918
you know Florida is the largest cannabis

130
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,478
Market in the world and I don't think a

131
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,459
lot of people know that and that's

132
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:02,219
because of Delta a THC we did an

133
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:04,258
economic Report with Beau Whitney who

134
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,960
will be here in a couple days but is a

135
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:08,400
6.9 billion dollar market I don't know

136
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,680
what California is off the top of my

137
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,539
head but it's probably around 5 billion

138
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,280
is my guess

139
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,759
um almost every company I would say 90

140
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:19,258
plus cash flow positive no serious

141
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,960
Investments have come into the sector

142
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,939
for the most part so everything's been

143
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,219
pretty organic and honestly I would say

144
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:29,219
done the proper way because of the lack

145
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,960
of Regulation now that being said there

146
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,940
you know there's a kind of got to put

147
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,859
some guard rails in that's something

148
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:36,660
that I work on on a state-by-state basis

149
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,360
I write most of the laws that go into

150
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,280
place so we Lobby in you know 12 States

151
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,220
and we're putting everything a little

152
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:46,739
the GE in the bottle a little bit but we

153
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,139
have 480 customers and there's thousands

154
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,199
of online brands that you can buy you

155
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:53,759
know 42 cannabinoids that we sell from

156
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,978
and so Brad with what you guys are doing

157
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,220
do you think that's going to help more

158
00:05:55,978 --> 00:06:00,599
quickly alleviate stigmas both here in

159
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,639
in U.S

160
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,900
yeah I think it's already doing that I

161
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,120
think we're also creating new customer

162
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:08,519
base a customer base that can go in and

163
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,340
buy medicine at a smoke shop or a gas

164
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:12,959
station I think it's creating almost I

165
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:14,219
don't want to say a soccer mom consumer

166
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,899
but it's it's giving people the

167
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,680
opportunity to try something that they

168
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:19,379
probably wouldn't have tried

169
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,199
alternatively and also it's killing the

170
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,360
black market which is good for some can

171
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,400
or it's bad for some cannabis companies

172
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,080
that are still engaged in that but it's

173
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,579
it's good for us

174
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,659
um or it's good for the hemp industry to

175
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:33,019
be able to say that we're killing the

176
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,020
black market

177
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:38,460
I think obviously there's there's a

178
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:39,959
degree of pessimism around where we're

179
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:42,779
at with the industry but I think what's

180
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,339
important to remember is in my opinion

181
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:46,918
this is one of the most important

182
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:49,619
industries of our time you know we we

183
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:52,500
forget about the impact that this can

184
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,720
have on our on our personal health uh

185
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,959
the impact that's Industrial Hemp can

186
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,120
have on on the planet and sustainability

187
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,038
um and I I'm excited for the future yes

188
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,199
we're all a bit burnt out we're all a

189
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:06,779
bit tired but you will you will not find

190
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:10,439
an industry on this planet right now

191
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:12,779
apart from maybe AI where you have such

192
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:15,120
a deeply committed

193
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:16,918
passionate and purpose-driven Industry

194
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,939
you know a lot of people in this

195
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:20,399
industry are in this industry because

196
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:22,680
they believe in this plant deeply you

197
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,079
know so I think we've been burnt and and

198
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,459
we need to learn from those mistakes you

199
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,379
know I'm gonna I'm gonna bang on about

200
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:30,180
the whole outdoor thing and endorsing

201
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:31,620
again because you know I know that

202
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,819
people in this room you know don't

203
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,220
necessarily have control over

204
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:37,560
legislation but if if your cannabis

205
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,199
clubs are restricted to cannabis from

206
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,598
Germany firstly you will fuel the

207
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,098
illicit Market because the Colombians

208
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:45,779
and the South Africans and developing

209
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:48,000
economies can grow for a fraction of

210
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:50,638
that price so I think there needs to be

211
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,959
a really a much more Global outlook on

212
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,019
on building this industry because

213
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:57,719
ultimately it has the potential to

214
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:59,399
completely seismically change the

215
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,840
trajectory of our planet in certain

216
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:02,818
areas and I think we've got to pull

217
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:04,560
together as a community in an industry

218
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:06,419
and figure out how we can Grease the

219
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,360
wheels to move this forward I don't want

220
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:11,698
to see anybody lose money anymore and I

221
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,699
think we can avoid that by learning from

222
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:19,319
from the mistakes that have and uh well

223
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:21,300
and just to add to the comments uh

224
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,560
to all these guys maybe we're wrapping

225
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,060
in a tidy bow because most of you

226
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,220
probably uh certainly weren't here when

227
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,019
I first started this morning but if you

228
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,879
really do look at cannabis being the

229
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:32,458
genus and then everything else

230
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,860
underneath it you know you have THC plus

231
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:38,399
THC minus which includes molecular hemp

232
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:40,500
which is flavonoids terpenes hhc some of

233
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,559
the miners and then you have THC plus

234
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,778
which is Delta Delta 9 thca you have the

235
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,179
regulated unregulated the whole kitten

236
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:50,039
caboodle if you will and the opportunity

237
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:51,778
there's a huge opportunity and I think

238
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:54,659
it's going to take some patience some

239
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:59,519
time and a lot of data whether it's hemp

240
00:08:54,659 --> 00:09:01,319
Drive THC hemp to drive CB D CBC or any

241
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,440
some of these other things coming from

242
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,820
outdoor cultivation but that being said

243
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,440
you know let's we'd like to have this

244
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,320
interactive you guys have stayed so late

245
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,600
for so we'll throw it out Hirsch do you

246
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,600
want to you can just speak up or

247
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,660
workout

248
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,659
s

249
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,379
obviously the regulatory model for hemp

250
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,120
has grown up in a very distinct way than

251
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:41,399
the regulatory model for psychoactive

252
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,980
cannabis and so my question is do you

253
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,259
envision the regulatory model for the

254
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,700
entire plant ultimately resembling the

255
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:49,919
world in which you operate is that

256
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,778
something that you advocate for and I

257
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:53,879
guess the last part of that question is

258
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:55,919
if that's true I'm curious how someone

259
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:57,240
like Oliver thinks about that right if

260
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,579
that's the world we're going to live in

261
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,320
in a decade or two how does that impact

262
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,180
the way that you think about investment

263
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,519
I'll just tell you what my personal

264
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:08,458
belief is is you know in the U.S 21 plus

265
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:13,379
here 18 plus five to six percent retail

266
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:14,879
tax GMP EU GMP made call today give it

267
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,860
food guidelines make it a food it's

268
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,720
commodity that's the way we treat it we

269
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,360
treat it as a commodity we sell like I

270
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,339
said 42 of these things so

271
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,419
um you know let people decide how they

272
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,920
want to consume it just like a

273
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:26,659
nutraceutical product or just like a

274
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,379
food

275
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,819
and you know we also have a

276
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:31,620
direct-to-consumer company where we get

277
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,940
to see the benefits of that you know

278
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,620
directly and obviously I have my clients

279
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,240
that talk to but

280
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,919
you know this is how this medicine

281
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,959
should be accessed and that's why the

282
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,479
hemp industry and other another fun fact

283
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:44,278
and this will come out in the next two

284
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,959
months the hemp industry is bigger than

285
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:47,820
the Cannabis Market the hemp industry is

286
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:50,399
about 40 to 50 billion in retail sales

287
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,860
in the US cannabis last year was 33

288
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,860
billion we did that in four years

289
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,480
cannabis has been around for 14 years so

290
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,480
we're growing up three four times the

291
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,700
pace I know the Florida statistics came

292
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,639
out too for the medical stuff I think it

293
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:09,300
was 250 million milligrams are consumed

294
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:10,500
last week we sell that every day so it

295
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:13,199
kind of just shows you the scale it

296
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,179
shows you the size another thing is my

297
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,800
chemist does a better job of explaining

298
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:18,958
this but

299
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,338
um you know the reality is is the demand

300
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:24,000
is going to outpace what you can grow

301
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:26,279
for for weed hemp's easier to grow so

302
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,839
it's it's just what's going to happen as

303
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:30,240
these markets do open up and I think

304
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,260
it's a necessary you know it's necessary

305
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,360
essentially

306
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:36,120
and Oliver I think the question was to

307
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,399
you too on that yeah so with regards to

308
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,980
regulations we never make bets and

309
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,958
regulations I think um

310
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,519
you know I think we've all probably got

311
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,539
a bit over excited at the start thinking

312
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,278
that certain things are going to happen

313
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,199
especially in the US and also now in

314
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:52,379
Germany

315
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,879
and our view now is that we operate only

316
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:56,820
within the regulatory Frameworks that

317
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,078
are in place and don't put any money

318
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,940
behind anything that relies on

319
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,939
regulatory change in order to affect

320
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,380
their business model that being said you

321
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,660
know Brett sounds like you're in a very

322
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:08,458
nice situation over there it's a hats

323
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:10,078
off to you for that um but yeah I

324
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,939
suppose what we look at in terms of

325
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,739
investment is also much more on the

326
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,959
medical and pharmaceutical side

327
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,940
uh so that takes us a little further

328
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,018
away from the plant itself so we look at

329
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,899
anything that affects the

330
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:24,240
endocannabinoid system be that

331
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:26,759
phytocannabinoid or synthetic

332
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,680
um so in a sense that constrains what we

333
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:31,019
look at from the broader cannabis

334
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:34,979
perspective because we we don't

335
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:38,220
typically look at producers but rather

336
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,079
look at ip-rich businesses that are

337
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,000
typically developing assets through

338
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:44,879
clinical trials so again a very

339
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,179
structured pre-existing regulatory

340
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:50,700
framework where we know the risks to an

341
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:52,019
extent that we can we know the costs and

342
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,040
we know what the price is at the end of

343
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:56,700
the road

344
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:59,458
so to add to that hers so again we're a

345
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:02,040
lead sponsor benzinga and I got up on

346
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:03,778
the stage and talked about Delta 8 and

347
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:07,259
you do that and Benzene is really all

348
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:08,879
about msos LPS th what we call again THC

349
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:11,159
Plus

350
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,620
and I thought I might get burned at the

351
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:16,379
stake right and then a month later we go

352
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,480
to can Med and you're a can Med it's all

353
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:20,278
about science and I learned in the fact

354
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,480
that I I didn't know and that's the cool

355
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:23,458
thing about this industry you're always

356
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,920
learning new stuff that there's a guy in

357
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:30,479
the U.S who's actually studying Delta

358
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:32,759
eight years in 1942 much sooner what 20

359
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,720
years more than 20 years than Rafi

360
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:38,819
mashulum would found THC or Delta 9. and

361
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,320
so the main point I want to make is this

362
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,600
is all about Innovation that's the way

363
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,100
the world works man and if you want to

364
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,899
try to get in front of innovation guess

365
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,639
what you're going to get run over so I'm

366
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,259
sorry but you know that's where this

367
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,079
industry is going whether you like it or

368
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:55,620
not and a lot of these msos don't like

369
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:57,359
it and you know it's it's where it's at

370
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,940
I mean I mean I think the whole division

371
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,620
between

372
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:04,440
hemp and cannabis which is the same

373
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:07,440
plant I think will eventually fall away

374
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:10,560
you know because you know to to separate

375
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,779
these these plants this plant into two

376
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,638
different uh Dimensions just based on

377
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:17,220
THC level I think it's very naive

378
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,620
because ultimately I think where it

379
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,720
needs to be regulated is actually at at

380
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,379
what the product is going to be used for

381
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:28,500
so for example our our medical farms in

382
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:30,539
South Africa uh cultivate flower and

383
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,578
they have to incinerate the leaves and

384
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:35,278
the stalks I mean this makes no logical

385
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:36,899
sense at all likewise we have a lot of

386
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,480
rural farmers who are have been

387
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:42,179
cultivating for hundreds of years and we

388
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:45,199
are looking at creating special zones

389
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:47,819
where they don't need specific licenses

390
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:49,799
and the flower goes one way and the

391
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,800
stalks and the and the leaves go another

392
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:54,179
way and I think that's that's eventually

393
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,819
where we'll see it goes I mean this

394
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:58,259
whole you know 0.2 percent for hampers

395
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,079
just a load of [ __ ] you know it

396
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:03,179
doesn't make any logical sense and I

397
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:04,919
think that that is eventually that those

398
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:07,559
those those lines will start to

399
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:09,240
dissipate and it'll be based on what the

400
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:10,979
actual plant is being used for as

401
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,980
opposed to its THC level that's just an

402
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,720
opinion we have I was in a government

403
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:18,060
pakisa uh last week and there were a

404
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,980
hundred delegates all debating this so

405
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:22,138
we are also trying to be Innovative as a

406
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,759
developing economy uh to to figure out

407
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:25,139
how we can work within our environment

408
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,399
and our different sort of technicalities

409
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:28,198
and processes and that's something that

410
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,360
we've been trying to figure out uh you

411
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:32,939
know over the last few months

412
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,440
Jim do you uh have any question that you

413
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,300
like the panel

414
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,560
yeah I'm still

415
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:39,559
really not enough

416
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:45,859
um the amount of money that was made

417
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,860
in kids

418
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:52,458
what was that stand again yes so I can

419
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,459
give you more stats

420
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:59,159
or the floor Florida 6.9 billion retail

421
00:15:56,578 --> 00:16:02,039
market and then we just did Texas Texas

422
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:05,000
at 3.3 billion dollar retail market so

423
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:05,000
Texas disaster

424
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,019
smoking it

425
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,000
yeah so there's you know we derive 42

426
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:13,740
cannabinoids from the hemp plan and a

427
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,740
lot of them are quite psychoactive yes

428
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,180
so Vapes gummies whatever you can you

429
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,379
can buy you can get high at something

430
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:21,379
you buy at the gas station now

431
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:28,799
we take CBD we isomerize it into Delta 8

432
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:30,859
and that's legal federally

433
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,859
um

434
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:36,600
it's him it's it's a cannabinoid derived

435
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,839
from the hemp plant is is the legal

436
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,839
definition

437
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:57,899
right and just

438
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:01,560
save families lives is this the same

439
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:03,539
time yeah we we so we take hemp we

440
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:05,099
isolate the CBD out and then we use it

441
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:07,318
to convert it to another cannabinoid so

442
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:09,740
we can make

443
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,740
yes

444
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:12,828
[Music]

445
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,900
es

446
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:31,619
almost anywhere that's a U.S based place

447
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,079
that hasn't banned it which is you know

448
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:36,000
West Coast essentially you can go into

449
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,339
smoke shops for sure but

450
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,599
about 25 percent of gas stations carry

451
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:41,599
it just you know not large

452
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:54,720
yeah

453
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:56,339
yeah exactly I mean people use it for

454
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,640
medicine obviously as we all know but

455
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:00,980
yeah it's pretty much

456
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,440
[Music]

457
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:06,120
no it's actually pure so we actually you

458
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,960
know isolate molecules to where they're

459
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:09,298
pure

460
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,160
so you know terpenes have been known to

461
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:12,839
be carcinogens for example we just make

462
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,179
pure molecules

463
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,859
so it's probably actually safer

464
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:18,720
isomerization is a pretty well known

465
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:20,759
process

466
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,279
so Pharmaceuticals you you know Hydra we

467
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:25,859
we do we do hydrogenation isomerization

468
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,178
you know your Butters hydrogenated

469
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:29,159
essentially so these are common

470
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:31,798
practices

471
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,840
so you're you're you're really trying to

472
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:35,279
and these are all phytocannon it's also

473
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:38,298
so they're found in the plant we just

474
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,298
have to scale them somewhere

475
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,660
one little gun creature

476
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:50,038
so people re-add in the terpenes like a

477
00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:53,179
company like true terpenes which is a

478
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:53,179
Goliath Company now

479
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:04,319
pretty much people can formulate

480
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,360
whatever we want you know ads 20 CBN

481
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:09,359
into your Delta 8 Vape now you got an

482
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:11,399
end to cut add 20 thcv in now you got a

483
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:13,439
sativa so that's that's what we're

484
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,500
seeing another thing I guess I'll say is

485
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,019
we've expedited the Cannabis science by

486
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,279
probably two decades just because of

487
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:22,700
what we've been able to do you know

488
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:25,678
cannabis companies typically sell CBN

489
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,720
thcb if they're special and and Delta 9

490
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,000
THC like I said our company sells 42

491
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,019
cannabinoids and these are all over the

492
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,200
market

493
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:36,779
wow

494
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,860
that's cool man no it's actually a good

495
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:39,058
question because I'm sure a lot of

496

important I mean there is a lot of

511
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:32,160
cannabis really stupid about hemp I just

512
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:33,918
know that when the hemp boom came in

513
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,600
Oregon and California

514
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:40,140
it was like everybody their brother and

515
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:41,699
the cartel were growing it and within a

516
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,700
year and a half everybody lost

517
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,679
everything every convention that had a

518
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,558
CBD in it and they didn't show up the

519
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:52,740
next year yeah so it was the one gold

520
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:55,440
rush I didn't go into that I want holy

521
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:58,019
[ __ ] I was smart for the first time but

522
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,740
now you're taking that hemp business

523
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:03,538
and creating really a business to get

524
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,679
high yeah we're taking all that crap and

525
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:07,879
we're converting it to Delta 8

526
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:07,880
essentially right okay

527
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:15,000
no I don't want to introduce myself

528
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:16,798
don't have to guess

529
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,480
if they don't guess

530
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:21,839
[ __ ] them I don't care

531
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,419

589

I I have a joint in my pocket

590
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:37,379
from Oregon

591
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:38,579
Southern Oregon and I have a bag

592
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:42,240
of

593
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:43,439
d8 what do you call it dh8 what is it

594
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,839
you're actually

595
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,960
Delta eight

596
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,839
I can give you a bag of Delta eight or a

597
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,819
joint for Morgan

598
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:55,918
what do you want to smoke

599
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:56,700
Oregon grows the second best weed in the

600
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,159
world

601
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,840
about the best weed in the world okay

602
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:03,059
just just you know

603
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:06,119
so it's a working man's weed is what

604
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:08,579
you're talking about gas stations and

605
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:10,079
it's a yeah like I was describing I

606
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:11,699
think we've converted a lot of people

607
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,319
that would never go into a medical

608
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,179
dispensary in a lot in most of these

609
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:17,639
states where we're big there aren't that

610
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:19,679
access anyway for example and and this

611
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,080
is a Florida's a medical State too but I

612
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,960
I was walking down Duval Street in Key

613
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:27,000
West Florida and there's three

614
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,740
dispensaries all shut down there's about

615
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,740
25 stores selling Delta 8.

616
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,419
so the Delta a guy just crushed the med

617
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:38,759
I have to be brought over to this don't

618
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:41,640
they just for some reason you're welcome

619
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:43,740
to chat about it yeah I I I I'm just I'm

620
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,980
not there yet I'm not there yet because

621
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:49,019
there are some stats that I heard but I

622
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:52,319
don't remember them see I'm not like you

623
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:54,658
40 billion yeah 40 billion uh in

624
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:56,579
Mississippi there was legislation that

625
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:59,039
they were fighting about trying to keep

626
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:01,619
the Delta eight out because of some

627
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:04,019
health issues that were sprung up from

628
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:06,538
the usage but that was I can't even

629
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:08,400
quote it so I don't have the credibility

630
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:09,839
here we get lots of propaganda against

631
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,140
us

632
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,759
yes right some anti-propagana yeah it

633
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:18,059
comes from the Cannabis side so usually

634
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:21,058
when we comes from my side yeah

635
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:24,480
you know what I mean you're right

636
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:26,639
what I heard was from a grower yeah they

637
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,019
really truly spent 10 million dollars

638
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,480
lobbying and we kicked their ass in

639
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:32,519
Florida up and down the street ah so

640
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,259
there is a fight between my side and

641
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:37,019
your side absolutely and this is why

642
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:39,000
here's the tension yeah and within five

643
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:42,179
minutes you'll be able to take bets

644
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,740
because we'll be wrestling right here

645
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:46,740
I'll make a prediction I think the fight

646
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:49,500
will be over but here's the irony here's

647
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,519
the irony in this discussion you don't

648
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,278
grow it

649
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:55,139
I do not

650
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:57,298
so in terms of in terms of what you're

651
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:59,640
saying where do you see things in the

652
00:25:57,298 --> 00:26:01,079
next five ten years in terms of hemp and

653
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,880
cannabis how do you see the market

654
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:04,558
shifting based on what you think let me

655
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,799
do the numbers for them and then you

656
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:10,399
explain 250 something eight twenty four

657
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:15,119
twenty times twenty twenty six million

658
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:17,820
26 million Delta 24.6

659
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:20,579
I expect Canada distribution I expect

660
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:22,399
Canada oh no 288 tax form distribution

661
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:25,500
Capital go right back to the investors

662
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,778
1.6 in the military make me sound like a

663
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,659
genius

664
00:26:26,778 --> 00:26:33,720
genius man you are a genius I'm not as

665
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:36,059
smart as you and if I had your shoes I'd

666
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,860
be better looking

667
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:39,240
how do you like my shoes I do like the

668
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:41,759
shoes look at my shoes like David's

669
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,319
better but I'm working on it why'd you

670
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:45,960
were curled under look at that I didn't

671
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:47,399
even do it right so I in the next year I

672
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,558
expect the fight to be over and I expect

673
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,080
him to win um there's some things that I

674
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:54,658
won't discuss on stage but

675
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:57,240
um things look very good for hemp that's

676
00:26:54,659 --> 00:27:00,480
for sure uh the EU is a different ball

677
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,159
game but we do Lobby here or we do I'll

678
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,778
be in Prague tomorrow for my Association

679
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,100
so

680
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:06,058
um we'll see what happens there they're

681
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:08,219
actually supposed to make a decision

682
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:11,038
tomorrow on hhc but do you think at some

683
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,019
point like the FDA will catch up because

684
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:14,339
it is psychoactive we're we're talking

685
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:16,460
to the FDA

686
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:19,139
and there they actually well

687
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,120
they told us they want to regulate it

688
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:24,059
our way they told us that they want to

689
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:26,459
regulate Delta 8.

690
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:28,740
they want they want to regulate like we

691
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,900
don't expect to get jeweled which if

692
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,579
people aren't familiars FDA came out and

693
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,620
just banned Jewel it was a big concern

694
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:36,480
of ours actually so we're in discussions

695
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:38,158
with the FDA and and the federal

696
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,659
government and in state I was meeting

697
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,760
with the governor of Kentucky four days

698
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:43,559
ago and I go I need I need seeds in the

699
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,960
ground so we're working on the economic

700
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:47,519
incentives to help the farmer

701
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,860
um so we are so if you want to move to

702
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,839
Kentucky I can help you out but I need a

703
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:55,500
1.5 I wanna that's what I want that's

704
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,759
I'm going right for it a hemp Farm in

705
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,919
Kentucky

706
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:01,259
that's what I want I think it's one of

707
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:02,940
the largest hemp States right yeah it's

708
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:05,579
my understanding is I don't know about

709
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,620
Acres but I think it is Mr senator in

710
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:09,000
Kentucky Governor Bashir as who I was

711
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:11,219
referencing

712
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,900
and then I'm meeting with you know a

713
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,159
bunch of Staff members but we're trying

714
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,320
to get as much hemp in the ground as

715
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,020
possible because we expect demand I mean

716
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:20,700
we I we turn down business all the time

717
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:22,918
we can't even keep up I know that I know

718
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,440
that I knew that I read that on your

719
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:27,659
your ad

720
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,798
you won't take your business all the

721
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:28,990
time I don't even need to [ __ ] be

722
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:30,839
here

723
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:33,000
[Laughter]

724
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:35,819
Brad did they have to give you any

725
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,380
reasons as to why they want to regulate

726
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:39,480
it on how they were going to go about it

727
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,980
I wasn't I mean I probably shouldn't be

728
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,099
speaking about this but I wasn't the one

729
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:46,620
that had the conversation but um

730
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:48,119
they they just wanted the the FDA is not

731
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:49,739
going to come out and say hey Delta it's

732
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:51,479
cool you know do whatever you want they

733
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,519
just want it regulated at the federal

734
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,860
level with more guidelines in the farm

735
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,139
bill essentially so I guess I'm giving

736
00:28:55,859 --> 00:29:00,658
out all the secrets now

737
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:03,360
so real quick uh

738
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:05,159
since now I have Jim Belushi on stage do

739
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:09,000
you have with regards to the title of

740
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:11,880
our talk your thoughts on the winners on

741
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,200
your experience the next couple of years

742
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,960
Jim

743
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,919
winners who will be the winners and the

744
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,778
losers

745
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:21,440
countries companies Technologies any

746
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:21,440
thoughts on that

747
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:34,278
it all sucks

748
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,278
it's uh it's

749
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,480
the only way you really can win in any

750
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:43,079
of these categories

751
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:46,399
is if you're driven

752
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:46,398
with purpose

753
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,839
and you have to be able to sacrifice

754
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:56,039
all kinds of [ __ ] to be committed to

755
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,840
your purpose

756
00:29:56,038 --> 00:30:00,298
and one of those things you have to

757
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:03,538
sacrifice is money

758
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:06,359
and of your purpose

759
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:09,599
is embedded in your body and your heart

760
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:12,058
you can be a winner no matter what

761
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,798
and my purpose

762
00:30:12,058 --> 00:30:17,639
is about

763
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:21,000
the healing benefits of cannabis

764
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:25,020
so when I see people veterans

765
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:28,200
that have PTSD that we're giving given a

766
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:29,759
bottle of 600 Oxycontin to help them

767
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,759
and

768
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:36,599
we move them over to cannabis

769
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:39,898
you know that changes everything for me

770
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:41,278
so I may lose money on my farm

771
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:43,079
uh

772
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:44,880
I can afford it

773
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:47,639
most a lot of farmers aren't they're

774
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,860
really struggling so it's easier for me

775
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:53,159
I'm luxurious to be able to keep on

776
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:55,558
purpose and my purpose is about healing

777
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:58,860
my purpose is about

778
00:30:55,558 --> 00:31:01,139
you know taking people

779
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:04,678
sort of loved with the hemp when I saw

780
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:06,659
these children in Colorado Springs

781
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:09,179
you know there was a little place called

782
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:11,039
the realm of care and they had about 30

783
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:14,700
40 children there

784
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:18,538
varying from age from 5 to 14 that we're

785
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:21,380
having so many seizures in a in a day

786
00:31:18,538 --> 00:31:24,359
that

787
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,320
the married couple it's hard for them to

788
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:27,898
stay married

789
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:29,460
because the mother is in the bedroom

790
00:31:27,898 --> 00:31:31,739
with the son

791
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:34,140
watching for the seizures

792
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:37,679
you know taking the sun into hospice

793
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:40,860
with 14 different kinds of medication

794
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:44,100
she is never in her husband's bed

795
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:46,678
their relations have gone to zero

796
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:49,619
so this family because of this disease

797
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:54,480
is about to split this family up

798
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:57,599
and to see what a little CBD oil did for

799
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,599
that child it saved the child it saved

800
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:03,959
the family I think cannabis

801
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:06,839
has a multitude of purposes and it's all

802
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:09,899
driven to

803
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:11,398
helping families which is where we live

804
00:32:09,898 --> 00:32:14,459
right

805
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:17,219
so there's a lot of guys smoking

806
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:20,700
I mean

807
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:22,980
so I think you're a natural winner

808
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,899
if you're in this industry

809
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:28,558
uh I don't know if you're the best

810
00:32:24,898 --> 00:32:31,439
businessman I know I'm not but uh I I

811
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:36,178
feel good every day when people are

812
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:38,399
healed or I mean I have a strain

813
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:42,179
I have a stream that's

814
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:45,778
not hemp it's uh Cherry Pie and it's

815
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:48,120
called and it's got like a 19 THC and

816
00:32:45,778 --> 00:32:50,640
about three percent terpenes you know

817
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:53,819
some limonene in it you know

818
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,500
and it's it's I'm a lightweight

819
00:32:53,819 --> 00:32:58,859
so I

820
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:01,200
I took a hit one hit and came downstairs

821
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:05,658
and saw my wife

822
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,659
and everything she said was beautiful

823
00:33:06,898 --> 00:33:10,918

830

832
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,960

835
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:43,080

836
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:44,640
I mean the interesting stat and I'll

837
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:47,599

838
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,980
want the stats

839
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:53,959
I have one

840
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,960
the state of Illinois they paid

841
00:33:54,259 --> 00:34:02,119
478 million dollars in

842
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:02,120
state taxes the Cannabis industry

843
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:11,960
in Illinois that year they paid

844
00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:11,960
278 million dollars in taxes for liquor

845
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:19,079
there's a lot more bars and liquor

846
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,500
stores than there are dispensaries

847
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:25,079
so the War on Drugs is still continuing

848
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:27,239
with the over Taxation and the over

849
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:30,119
regulation and when this gentleman is

850
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:31,378
talking about is moving all out on the

851
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:33,240
side of that

852
00:34:31,378 --> 00:34:35,398
which is cool

853
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:37,799
which is cool

854
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:41,039
and if it's if it's medically motivated

855
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,899
I think it's even super cool

856
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:45,779
um but I don't know the medical benefits

857
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:49,039

858
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:52,500
