hoping everyone is ready for a very

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,660
interesting discussion and not being

9
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:28,439
forced to run around the streets naked

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,698
or eating Edibles anytime soon

11
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,618
um we're going to be talking about

12
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,420
branding and branding has been always a

13
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:36,420
massive passion of mine I come just to

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,559
introduce myself first I I present Euro

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,480
monitor your monitor is a market

16
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:41,339
business company looking into many

17
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:42,058
different fmcg Industries around the

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,800
world

19
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:46,140
historically over the last 17 years I've

20
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:48,419
been looking into alcoholic drinks and

21
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,039
it's an industry that I've been very

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,079
passionate about and it's an industry

23
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,420
that also taught me the importance of

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,340
branding and branding is equally

25
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,140
important in cannabis something that

26
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,359
sometimes we I think forget to talk

27
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,359
about and everyone in the panel to die

28
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:06,900
today either by the relationship with

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,879
business to consumers or business to

30
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,740

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,118

Jamie Pearson I'm really happy to be

40
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,579
here

41
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:30,900
um I am the founder and president of the

42
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,978
New Holland Group which is an

43
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,618
international consultancy I came to this

44
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:41,039
position from being the CEO of bang many

45
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:43,438
of you know our chocolate bars that I

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,299
ran that company for seven years and

47
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,879
when I started we were in California and

48
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,759
when I left we had expanded our brand

49
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:52,259
into seven U.S states and we were the

50
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,599
number one number two number six

51
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,478
chocolate in Canada and then we had a

52
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:59,519
CBD line that made it in onto shelves in

53
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:02,280
like eight European countries

54
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,019
so I know a little bit about branding

55
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,780

56
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:09,840
and what I do now is help companies and

57
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,979

89
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:48,719

90
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,939
15 years was to run cannibal Social

fun there

um but I I sold everything last year

97
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,378

109
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:44,960
founded Oceanic in 2017 with my partner

110
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:47,240
we both quit our jobs and opened up a

111
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:51,659
grow up

112
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:54,900
since then we have

113

founded a few other brands so we're a

114
00:04:54,899 --> 00:05:01,198
licensed producer in Canada and then we

115
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:06,478
open up nine retail stores through those

116
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:09,660
retail stores we then had the direct you

117
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:11,758
know business to a consumer where we

118
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,939
could create new brands and we created

119
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,139
Oceanic craft cannabis seaweed and then

120
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:18,000
booty

121
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:20,418
and I'm super happy to be here so thank

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,418
you very much

123
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:24,500
these are all exciting stories as you

124
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,500
can tell

125
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,478
and as I said hope that everyone here

126
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,560
will be inspired and and one of the

127
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,000
issues that I've been facing with you

128
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,160
cannabis industry looking at it for the

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,199
last seven years eight years myself is

130
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,900
this in some cases

131
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,639
um lack of understanding of or or or the

132
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:44,038
importance of branding that all of you

133
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,120
of us in this panel here hopefully fully

134
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:46,800
understand

135
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,379
um so I can start with this question

136
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,300
what separates cannabis to other fmcg

137
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,620
Industries like what's what is unique

138
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,720
and I'm sure there are many things that

139
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,819
are unique and how

140
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,560
are you all dealing with the challenges

141
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:00,599
the unique challenges that cannabis has

142
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,660
both in terms of marketing both in terms

143
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,400
of branding or positioning and Jane we

144
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,479
can find with you and perhaps the story

145
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,159
of punk

146
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,258
okay

147
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,780
um I think the

148
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:16,020
obvious answer that pops right into my

149
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:18,239
head is that the ability to scale a

150
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:20,519
brand is very difficult because you

151
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,879
can't cross borders so in for example in

152
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:27,000
the United States you couldn't have one

153
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:28,379
production facility and then send your

154
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,759
chocolate bars to the 50 different

155
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:32,159
states you'd have 50 different

156
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,979
production facilities that meant 50

157
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,900
different heads of your kitchen 50

158
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:39,839
different you know rules on your

159
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:41,459
packaging which if you really do confuse

160
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,459
activity with results because you're

161
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:46,500
just spinning your wheels when really

162
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:49,379
what you have is a product or a brand

163
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,899
that you're trying to expand and so the

164
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:54,060
the legislation and the inability to

165
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:55,859
scale isn't even different in Europe

166
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,199
it's the same thing when you're watching

167
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,020
that with the European regulations if

168
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:04,080
it's medical and the Cannabis is being

169
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:07,258
imported into Germany or being imported

170
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:09,240
into France for a medical reason

171
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:12,000
um you don't have one facility

172
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,639
Manufacturing and the medicine going

173
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,300
across borders so until we kind of get

174
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:21,300
those things figured out branding is a

175
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,460
very difficult proposition

176
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,220
I would add stigma I know I'm stating

177
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:27,899
the obvious but the obvious must be

178
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,819
addressed

179
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:33,959
um I mean I remember when I started in

180
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:35,879
2014 uh when I started telling my former

181
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,680
colleagues in banking and government

182
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:40,019
that I was going into the Cannabis

183
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,280
sector they started saying you know all

184
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:42,240
kinds of things that was going to be a

185
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,918
criminal and I was going to be in jail

186
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,079
there was a lot of stigma I saw the

187
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:48,418
shift in North America but here in

188
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,038
Europe this still is I mean I'm From

189
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:52,500
Italy I currently live in the south of

190
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:55,740
Italy I assure you I haven't told anyone

191
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:58,800
there that I'm in cannabis we're keeping

192
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,478
it on DL so stigma is something that one

193
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,639
you know when it comes to branding

194
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:08,519
depending on at what stage of maturation

195
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,379
your Market is at you really have to

196
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:13,500
face that from the get-go and I think

197
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:16,079
what's what worked for me early on was

198
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,959
really to embrace education and not try

199
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,639
to sort of you know hide from it but to

200
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,859
really sort of move forward with with

201
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,259
authenticity and with good and with

202
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,419
transparency and Clarity in terms of

203
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:29,098
what does your brand do you know what

204
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:31,318
does it mean to be in cannabis so I'll

205
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:33,418
leave it at that

206
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,219
um here I would say here in Germany we

207
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:37,079
have our biggest problems are all the

208
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:39,959
Restriction when it comes to the

209
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,240
marketing you know um when we try to to

210
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,699
Market over social media like Tick Tock

211
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,740
YouTube Instagram we cannot talk about

212
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,620
cannabis everybody is talking about

213
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,839
nowadays about broccoli no everybody

214
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,899
knows broccoli stands for cannabis but

215
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,700
even when when we try to to promote our

216
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,759
Tick Tock channel for one of our Brands

217
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:02,580
we get banned when we show flowers we

218
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:04,500
get banned when we show a joint you know

219
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,620
you mentioned you mentioned in the green

220
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,480
room um earlier that you might have

221
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,700
found in alternative avenue or a channel

222
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,980
that could you could get away with

223
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:18,060
advertising your product it's it's just

224
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:21,300
we have to find web fruits like we don't

225
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:24,179
lift up joints in our Cliffs we lift up

226
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:27,120
pants you know something

227
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:29,399
you know and and even with Tick Tock

228
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,060
it's really strict Tech talk is one of

229
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:35,519
the most famous social media platforms

230
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:37,919
but even when we have showing like

231
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,259
flowers in the in the back not even in

232
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,539
the front I mean in our store to promote

233
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:44,939
some songs on products uh this videos

234
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:48,179
get banned just because somewhere in the

235
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:51,660
back there is a tiny flower and this is

236
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:53,579
something a big uh it could you more

237
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:56,278
than could some kind of humor or even

238
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:58,080
you know doubling down on broccoli for

239
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:59,580
example for that matter or or finding

240
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,800
alternative channels Beyond Tick Tock or

241
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,259
the major social media channels

242
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,958
um I think the point is that you can do

243
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:08,759
that but you're trying to run a business

244
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,419
and what you're having to do is find

245
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:14,220
these workarounds banking

246
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:16,500
media you don't get to just run a

247
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:19,320
business you your your job really is to

248
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,120
become a problem solver and try to do

249
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,740
business but

250
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,320
um you know we cannot clearly speak

251
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:28,320
about our products we we cannot clearly

252
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,300
speak for for what our what's the best

253
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,940
for our products what what what kind of

254
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:35,399
use you can use it because then we are

255
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,380
Health claims you know and uh because

256
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:39,600
nobody in our industry had right now

257
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:42,299
enough money to make the clinical

258
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,820
studies and all that everybody knows

259
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:46,799
that cannabis is good everybody knows

260
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,440
cannabis helps for cancer for everybody

261
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,719
else but we are not allowed to to say it

262
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,040
I don't want to promote that cannabis as

263
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,320
good against cancer but there are a lot

264
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,480
of other things everybody know it's good

265
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,640
for to be more relaxed to get pain

266
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,139
relief

267
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,399
we mentioned the stigmatization I think

268
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:04,139
stigma is a very important conversation

269
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,179
and I want to go to Taylor now

270
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:08,220
um because Taylor you had an interesting

271
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:10,500
approach for making your brand and

272
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,720
products not just the stigmatizing but

273
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,980
also making it less intimidating right

274
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,060
which I think is an essential part of

275
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,278
this conversation yeah it's going to

276
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:19,619
Second the stigma um

277
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,419
in how we approached it was we had the

278
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,278
opportunity to open up our own stores

279
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:24,838
and branded stores so the first thing

280
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:26,399
you know two things I realized when I

281
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,040
got into cannabis that no matter if it

282
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,720
had to be medical or recreational it had

283
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,639
to come from a licensed producer so I

284
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,680
started there and the second thing was

285
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,379
that stigma was huge and it was it was

286
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:41,159
there so how do we make this

287
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:43,439
more accepting to all and you know so we

288
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:45,659
started with the with the store so you

289
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,420
know my thought process was to make it

290
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:50,759
as approachable as possible uh to get

291
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:52,799
people in there uh and we did things

292
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:54,659
like uh well you know it's aesthetically

293
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,338
beautiful it doesn't necessarily look

294
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:59,399
like a cannabis you know your your

295
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:02,040
typical stigma cannabis store it smells

296
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,360
like coffee we sell coffee and we did

297
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:05,639
things like we had the first drive

298
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,919
through in Canada

299
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:10,799
um we often have you know I really

300
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,479
promote both sexes to sell cannabis but

301
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,659
I really promote women to sell cannabis

302
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,159
is kind of you know the same

303
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:18,659
premise of jewelry you know the Nan

304
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,639
selling or the grandmother selling

305
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:22,319
jewelry it's the same same deal you know

306
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,720
you you feel more comfortable when

307
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,760
there's a a female presence there or or

308
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,220
someone who doesn't look like the stigma

309
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:30,860
not that females don't smoke cannabiscus

310
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,360
I sure do

311
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,740
but it did take me a little bit to

312
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,539
almost come out of the closet with that

313
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,339
you know because there is a stigma

314
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:40,559
especially for mothers for this for that

315
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:43,440
so we really did

316
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,479
um create this approachable retail

317
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,579
experience rather than this transaction

318
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,899
where you had to run in and out

319
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:50,699
we had an interesting conversation

320
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,200
earlier about the importance of

321
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,240
celebrity cultural celebrity

322
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,639
endorsements and again coming from the

323
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,419
alcohol industry

324
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:59,278
celebrity endorsements and and

325
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:01,078
relationships with alcohol has been a

326
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,299
very long story going on back about a

327
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:04,319
century or so and even accelerating in

328
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:06,659
the last couple of years I don't think

329
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,519
there's any Hollywood loyalty character

330
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:11,039
that hasn't had their own tequila or

331
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,120
Jean brand in the last couple of years

332
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,578
um and we had a very passionate

333
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,320
conversation about that defending views

334
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:18,899
um what are your thoughts on the

335
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,339
relation of cannabis brands with the

336
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:23,039
celebrity culture and their

337
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:24,899
cross-pollination Jamie would you like

338
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,299
to start sure

339
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:30,240
um it doesn't work

340
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:32,219
and I mean it right now it doesn't work

341
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,560
people don't care

342
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,120
you could have you know Barack Obama

343
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:37,559
selling weed if the weed's not good

344
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,940
they're not going to buy it they don't

345
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:42,299
care

346
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,959
um part of that is because

347
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:44,819
um

348
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:48,119
you don't have the ability like Stefan

349
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:50,760
said you can't Market it so part of the

350
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,039
celebrity attraction if you're a brand

351
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:55,439
is that you can harness their followers

352
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:56,939
or you can harness their following but

353
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,600
when you're hamstrung on what's

354
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:03,000
happening with your marketing efforts

355
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,639
it kind of hamstrings the celebrity so

356
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,440
to speak then you know the other piece

357
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,680
is we still have a little bit of an

358
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,380
identity crisis in cannabis are we cpg

359
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:16,559
are we medicine

360
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:18,120
um are we a social lubricant what were

361
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,919
all of those things wait no we're

362
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,379
agriculture

363
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:25,199
um we haven't figured out yet how to

364
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:26,519
take the industry

365
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,459
and

366
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:32,278
help the analysts analyze what we are as

367
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:34,559
an industry so throwing a celebrity at

368
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:37,320
it is just another one of those well

369
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:39,179
maybe this will work but it's an attempt

370
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,540
to do a workaround and you know another

371
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:46,319
workaround we figured out at bang was

372
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:48,179
I can't I can't do a promotion I can't

373
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,339
put well we did a deal with Jim Belushi

374
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:52,620
for example we had a

375
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:56,459
um a Blues Brothers line of chocolate

376
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:59,220
bars and we couldn't promote them but

377
00:14:56,458 --> 00:15:01,619
Jim could and but Jim couldn't promote

378
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,339
him like go buy this chocolate bar he

379
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:07,198
could go on his television show and say

380
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:09,000
I use this chocolate bar every single

381
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,759
night I love it it's the best tasting

382
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,339
thing but then to get the consumer who's

383
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,778
watching that program to then have a

384
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:19,199
clickable link which is what you

385
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:21,360
typically need to convert the the vision

386
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:23,879
to a purchase

387
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,919
you can't have that it doesn't exist so

388
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:28,259
right now I'm just telling you don't do

389
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:31,740
it the regulations definitely change

390
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:35,100
before or anything Angela had some very

391
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:37,799
interesting so I agree uh I mean the so

392
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,300
we an eventually that we did to Consumer

393
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:40,198
Behavior studies over the past seven

394
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:42,059
years

395
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:44,039
brand loyalty and I think this is a

396
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:45,599
topic that's been covered but brand

397
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:46,620
loyalty in the Cannabis industry is

398
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,240
something that we're still struggling

399
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,278
with and that's part of why we are here

400
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,198
to talk about it

401
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:53,820
um so I I agree with everything that

402
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:58,379
Jimmy just said because it's on point I

403
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:59,519
would I would just add two two caveats

404
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:01,439
is not the right term but two

405
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,360
differentiating points from a launch

406
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,800
perspective because branding is two

407
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,139
parts to Brand right introducing the

408
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:09,299
brand get traction get your brand seen

409
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:12,120
and differentiated at the beginning uh

410
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:13,859
so that you know a you can acquire that

411
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,019
customer from some other product there's

412
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,879
that stage and then there's the brand

413
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:19,919
loyalty where you want that customer to

414
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:21,419
continue to buy your product from a

415
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,719
launching perspective and go to market

416
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:28,439
perspective as long as that celebrity is

417
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,060
authentic and authentically aligns with

418
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,339
your products and what your product is

419
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:34,319
one you know stands for then I actually

420
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:36,240
believe that it could be powerful but

421
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,579
from a market entry a market launch

422
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,740
perspective but when you then you go

423
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:42,719
into sort of Market retention and

424
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,940
maintaining your position and sort of

425
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,500
that repeat customer it really is going

426
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,360
to come back to the basics and the

427
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,639
experience of that of that consumer and

428
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,560
the quality of your product and and we

429
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,379
go back to everything that Jamie said so

430
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:58,198
that that would be my two cents yeah I

431
00:16:55,379 --> 00:17:00,659
would totally agree that the best uh

432
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:02,578
example for for this is like uh Snoop

433
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:04,199
Dogg everybody would agree that Snoop

434
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:06,178
Dogg is one of the best celebrity when

435
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,220
it comes to cannabis

436
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:11,059
um but the consumers are no no not

437
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:14,100
stupid when you see Snoop Dogg try to

438
00:17:11,058 --> 00:17:16,980
build a big cannabis brand but it didn't

439
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:20,099
work because he stand not uh behind it

440
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:22,439
he they just put his name on the product

441
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:24,119
many of them never found out yeah

442
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,980
apparently many of them didn't even know

443
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:28,019
that this was Snoop Dogg's brand yeah

444
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,720
and and then so it's it's not just to

445
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:33,599
put a big name on it you have to have

446
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,579
the the right strategy it has not to be

447
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,918
just the name and then everything sells

448
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:39,899
by them all no it's like quality it's

449
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,140
like the it has to be a true story the

450
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,280
people has to to believe it

451
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,780
there's another celebrity element that

452
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:47,160
we can call on celebrities in a way

453
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:48,839
they're not actual celebrities in that

454
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,000
sense but um you mentioned earlier in

455
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:53,339
the conversation uh recommendations by

456
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,720
breeders or bad vendors or this side

457
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:57,119
which some of them in the next couple of

458
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,500
years will become their own right yeah

459
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,139
it's it's a little like when you look

460
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,940
into the U.S market uh like the big

461
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,440
Brands like Tango cookie they're they're

462
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,840
breeders they're they're not the

463
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,940
dispensary

464
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:11,038
Brands sure uh like cookies there they

465
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,620
open up some the dispensaries but the

466
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:17,160
people know the brand behind and they're

467
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:19,079
looking for uh cookies weed everywhere

468
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,580
and every dispensary they buy the

469
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:23,639
Georgia pie because it's from cookies

470
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:27,538
you know and this is what uh I see also

471
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:30,299
here in in Germany with the like it's uh

472
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:33,119
will be the Restriction of marketing for

473
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:35,400
for the clubs like in Spain with the

474
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,798
Cannabis Social Club you cannot make

475
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,200
promotion you cannot have big signs on

476
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:43,319
the door it's all like underground

477
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,538
there's just a a black door with a bell

478
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:47,700
and with some cameras when you see a

479
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:51,179
bell and cameras usually in Spain it's a

480
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:53,700
canvas Club so try to get in but you

481
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:57,120
cannot promote and others with the

482
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,860
breeder Brands behind they can promote

483
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,379
and when people know we're in in this

484
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:04,139
club or in this dispensary they have the

485
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:09,120
the strains from from this breeder this

486
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:10,860
is something I would Market on

487
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,479
well I think they're authentic but the

488
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:14,219
all the other thing we all know is that

489
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,259
cookie sells more sweatshirts than

490
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:19,700
cannabis but there's also kind of

491
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:19,700
marketing data so um

492
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:26,819
to Market so in DC the regulation was

493
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:29,220
such so I started my business

494
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:31,740
for 20 years in Washington DC out of the

495
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,900
37 plus DC states in the US it's kind of

496
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,179
a weird scenario where

497
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:39,000
you you're allowed to grow for yourself

498
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:41,100
but you're not allowed to sell it but

499
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,859
you get allowed to use it

500
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:46,439
so what happened in DC is what you have

501
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:48,359
is lots of t-shirts are being sold in DC

502
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,140
like lots of t-shirts and lots of

503
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:53,538
posters and lots of stickers but in

504
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,919
which I actually found very interesting

505
00:19:53,538 --> 00:19:57,900
you're buying the t-shirt and then they

506
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,820
give you and then they give to you no

507
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,100
it's a gift they gift you the weed

508
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:04,558
you're paying for the T-shirt

509
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:06,719
um what's the same in New York right now

510
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:08,399
yes right now yeah at the beginning yeah

511
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,720
and Oregon it was lighter she buy the

512
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,820
lighter you get the weed with it there

513
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,279
you go exactly but but even if it's not

514
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:16,798
mandated by you know the weirdness of

515
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:18,660
the regulatory environment what you know

516
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,579
you detail in terms of like it's a

517
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,960
coffee shop you come and get coffee and

518
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:24,240
then you also have these other things

519
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,798
there's some genius there and it does

520
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,480
make it approachable and I think from a

521
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:29,460
branding and traction perspective in

522
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,558
early stage markets where there is still

523
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,900
that stigma that's something that I

524
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:35,339
would certainly consider I'm not saying

525
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,500
you have to gift the product but like

526
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:39,359
incorporate that in it right and our

527
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,460
thought process was if I can get a butt

528
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:45,899
in a seat then we can educate and and

529
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:47,579
get branding into into the consumer you

530
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,220
know in theory of course everyone would

531
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,720
think that a celebrity would work but

532
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,100
like everyone said there's so many

533
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,259
loopholes that we have to go through

534
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:57,538
that we can't actually do it properly so

535
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:59,400
we're just throwing in at the wall and

536
00:20:57,538 --> 00:21:01,919
it's not sticking

537
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,679
you have to find the right solution yeah

538
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,720
but his name doesn't but Legally Legally

539
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,820
in Canada you're not unless they own

540
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,100
your company or have part ownership of

541
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:12,839
your company they can't really do it

542
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:14,279
justice like they do with alcohol or

543
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:16,259
anything else I mean I'm influenced

544
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:19,139
every day by celebrities but not on

545
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:20,819
cannabis yet at least yet yes and I

546
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,380
believe it's possible but I believe the

547
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:24,418
first thing that needs to happen is are

548
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,700
the regulations really need to kind of

549
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:29,038
round out and you know hopefully Canada

550
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:31,200
gets there I think I think that kind of

551
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,640
brings me to my last key point which is

552
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,038
um what I've called in the past this

553
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,640
kind of fetishization or hyper focus on

554
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:40,140
on pricing versus THC content which I

555
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,080
think is a plague for the industry in

556
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:45,659
the in North America

557
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:48,418
it devalues many of the brands high THC

558
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:50,240
low price what's your opinion from the

559
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:53,940
dispensary perspective as well in Canada

560
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,339
sorry well from our uh perspective I

561
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,900
mean we like I said we have the ability

562
00:21:56,339 --> 00:21:59,339
to create our own brand so I mean

563
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,200
obviously we saw exactly how them are

564
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:03,359
Market was going so we created booty

565
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,659
which is our Pirate's Booty better than

566
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:08,699
booty value brand and it's it's 50 of

567
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:11,400
our sales you know and that's exactly

568
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:14,100
what's selling high THC low price and

569
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,780
it's you know value ounces it's a

570
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:17,399
self-fulfilling prophecy though and it

571
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:19,619
was one of my big frustrations at bang

572
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,780
is that frustrating every day um the

573
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:24,599
dispensary owner would say I looked at

574
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:26,099
the data and everybody wants 30 or

575
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:29,459
higher I'm like but that's all you're

576
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:31,439
buying so you're offering that to them

577
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:34,140
the dispensaries had to do a better job

578
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,840
of educating that it's the terpene the

579
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,640
Entourage or Ensemble effect

580
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:40,500
um you know we've got to do a better job

581
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,940
of as an industry of educating the

582
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,119
consumer

583
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:48,000
um but Giada knows the data on that well

584
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:50,819
that I I was going to add that's so true

585
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,460
this self-fulfilling prophecy not to say

586
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:55,259
that we haven't all gone to the

587
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,940
dispensary and looked for the high THC

588
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:58,859
and low-cost product because I know we

589
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,360
all have but it goes beyond that and

590
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:01,859
depending on your customer who your

591
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:03,839
target audience is if you're a baby

592
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:06,839
boomer that's going in to actually

593
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,038
because you have joint pain you're

594
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:10,619
probably not going to be looking for the

595
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:12,359
high THC low-cost product right and that

596
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:15,178
population group the demographic is

597
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:17,038
growing you now if you are a parent that

598
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:19,080
has a child with a condition you're

599
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:22,140
going to look for Purity and quality and

600
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:24,538
standardization so I think that I do

601
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:26,280
believe I agree 100 that education is

602
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:27,720
really important and the most recent

603
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,639
information and data that's been

604
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,279
collected about the consumer behavior

605
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,020
that takes into account the growth of

606
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:36,298
various demographic groups and their

607
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:38,879
Traction in the space does show that

608
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:41,819
there is difference in Behavior amongst

609
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,220
different consumer archetypes that is

610
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:47,099
not just one bag everybody wants the

611
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:49,679
high THC low cost that is well it's

612
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:51,000
still prominent it is not true for

613
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,220
everyone and it certainly is not

614
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,279
expected to continue to to be so which

615
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:58,798
means two things for those who are new

616
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:01,500
to the space one you can find your Niche

617
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:03,779
and think about who your audience is and

618
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:06,000
two once you do know how to Market to

619
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:08,700
them because it's not cookie cutter well

620
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,220
one of the things I also saw was

621
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:14,159
the consumer is purchasing an effect

622
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,980
they don't the majority of consumers are

623
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,480
not walking in and saying

624
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:20,400
Stefan I know you're an exam an

625
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,500
exception he he wants to know what

626
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,940
breeder and all of that but the majority

627
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,038
of the consumers walk in and they say

628
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,720
I'm struggling with sleep well then you

629
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:32,158
have all these brands that are calling

630
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:35,400
their products sleep or Bliss or calm or

631
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,140
focus and those so we know that because

632
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,538
those brands are selling in the most

633
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:42,659
popular effect that's getting purchased

634
00:24:39,538 --> 00:24:43,980
right now is sleep we know that the

635
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:45,299
consumer comes in and they want to buy

636
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,659
an effect

637
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:50,339
from that perspective I heard the

638
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:52,020
brilliant Rob mcelvoy I don't even know

639
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:53,279
if he's in here but if you ever get to

640
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:55,379
meet him I know he's at the conference

641
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,418
he said this

642
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,820
every other industry starts with the

643
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:01,860
consumer and works backwards we figure

644
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:03,658
out what does the consumer want and then

645
00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:05,759
we take their order and we deliver it to

646
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:06,960
them cannabis starts with the plant and

647
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:08,819
goes forward

648
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,919
like well I've got this purple flower

649
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:13,259
I've got this flower I've got this

650
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:14,640
strain or I've got this and then you

651
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:17,339
figure out what can you do with it and

652
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,440
what is it good for we need to be

653
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:21,959
starting with the consumer first if you

654
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,460
want to build a brand that lasts you got

655
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,519
to start with what the consumer wants

656
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:29,100
yeah I think this is a a good thing and

657
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:31,200
this is also one of the problems we're

658
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:33,599
facing with the upcoming decrimination

659
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,700
here in Germany and with the clubs when

660
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,619
we see the the club's maximum 500

661
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:41,038
members there will be a lot of clubs

662
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:43,319
with less members than 500 but they also

663
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:46,319
have to give their members a variety of

664
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:48,538
strange and this is something a small

665
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:51,178
club with let's say one of people how

666
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:53,519
can they grow at least 10 different

667
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:55,679
strains for all the the different things

668
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:58,980
that you need this is also a big problem

669
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:01,620
I think because like like we have in my

670
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,900
clubs in in Spain for me it was always a

671
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:05,639
must that I had to have at least 20

672
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,740
different strains of wheat in the Shelf

673
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,419
because I think this is what the the

674
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,519
customers want they want to come in the

675
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:13,919
dispensary on a club and they want to to

676
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:15,839
choose not from one or two or three

677
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,259
different strains they want to to come

678
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:21,058
in and get flashed about all the variety

679
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:23,700
of strengths you can get and then the

680
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:24,740
button vendor has to explain has to

681
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,940
education

682
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:28,259
something for the day and you smoke

683
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,298
something for the sleep and you smoke

684
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:32,038
something before you eat and they're not

685
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:34,558
the same like you've got to have variety

686
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:36,538
can the can the clubs can you have one

687
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:37,740
club that just focuses on Edibles I know

688
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:39,359
Edibles aren't like okay that was a

689
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,278
terrible question can you have one club

690
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:43,439
that focuses on this and one club that

691
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:46,079
focuses on that and then you sell to

692
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,880
your members and then they can exchange

693
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:49,199
um

694
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,020
or the details we are waiting for for

695
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,940
the upcoming uh uh law that's what I

696
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:56,400
always say it depends all them about the

697
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,740
details it makes absolute sense that the

698
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,980
clubs can trade their their genetics in

699
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:04,200
between because nobody can can grow all

700
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,519
strains perfectly what's going to be I

701
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,679
think for sure and we know this

702
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,079
everybody in this room is a cannabis

703
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,980
entrepreneur we will find the work

704
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:12,960
around

705
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:16,259
that's what we do creativity and

706
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,940
authenticity oh we are used to it I

707
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:19,079
would like us to open up to the floor

708
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,298
because we have another only a couple of

709
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:22,859
minutes left and hopefully there are a

710
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:25,740
couple of questions anyone that would

711
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:27,599
like to ask anything or any brands that

712
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,278
you find inspiring from the global

713
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:30,298
Community or the global industry right

714
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:33,079
now

715
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:33,079
um anything

716
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,679
I'm hurry

thank you Michelle

718
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,480
good afternoon everyone my name is Luke

719
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:50,460
mandroy I'm a filmmaker there's one

720
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,259
brand from the US that comes to my mind

721
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,538
now that you're asking the question a

722
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:57,000
brand that first had the objective to

723
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:58,980
change something uh I don't want to say

724
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,099
any names it's a vaporizing brand who

725
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,839
said we want to

726
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:05,759
end tobacco smoking

727
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,439
that's what the CEO taught me in the

728
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:08,879
interview and I was like wow that's a

729
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,620
very powerful statement and actually

730
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,960
everything they're doing nowadays is

731
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:14,699
like helping consumers within the

732
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,558
Cannabis industry to get rid of the

733
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,840
tobacco which I think is great and like

734
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:21,298
how many lungs had a positive effect

735
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:25,558
including my own that I tried this and

736
00:28:21,298 --> 00:28:28,740
it actually worked so um I would ask you

737
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:31,259
on the um in the panel here

738
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:34,620
um what inspiration keeps you going for

739
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:37,379
your own projects which Vision do you

740
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:40,439
keep working on and also the rest of

741
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:42,778
here we have very very successful CEO

742
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,179
sitting here what do you think is the

743
00:28:42,778 --> 00:28:47,339
overall potential of this industry to

744
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:48,798
create a positive impact for patients

745
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:50,699
and Beyond

746
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:54,599
question

747
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:57,419
it's a large question but uh

748
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:59,519
um I think what keeps me going is you

749
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:01,380
know I when we first started this I was

750
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:04,079
like okay how do I help as many people

751
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:06,900
as I possibly can and you know in terms

752
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:09,079
of branding and and getting around all

753
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:12,059
the regulations we really just try to

754
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:13,199
like Jamie said you know get cheeky with

755
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:15,538
The Branding

756
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,120
um and

757
00:29:15,538 --> 00:29:19,679
make it universally known Oceanic was

758
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:21,719
you know it's healing to all people

759
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:25,019
understand all over the world that oh

760
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,419
the ocean is is is healing uh seaweed

761
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:30,960
the weed is in the name so that's cheeky

762
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:32,880
and um but ultimately you know

763
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,340
we just want to help as many people as

764
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,200
we possibly can so we just keep going

765
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:40,319
and I would say uh you're talking about

766
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,538
uh patients I would not say that we have

767
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:44,220
adjust the patience in mind I have the

768
00:29:42,538 --> 00:29:46,259
Cannabis consumers in mind right The

769
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,720
Economist patients are just a really

770
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:50,158
small group of uh to talk about

771
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,960
recreational as well because recently

772
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,940
has become almost a taboo to acknowledge

773
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,740
the importance of people just consuming

774
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,659
cannabis for fun for recreation

775
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,220
Recreation is part of mentorship yeah

776
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:01,440
and you know that's the far bigger

777
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:03,778
marketer I think so

778
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,259
um that's so my focus is not on on

779
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:07,980
Commerce patients there are a lot of

780
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:10,019
pharmaceutical companies medical

781
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:13,519
cannabis companies there focus on them

782
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:13,519
I'm focused on the rest

783
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,399
um I remember hearing about the triple

784
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:19,319
bottom line

785
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:22,199
years ago I'm not going to say how many

786
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:23,759
story is going to age me but

787
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,019
um I remember thinking wow what a great

788
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:26,519
concept that you know I had heard about

789
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:27,720
the double bottom line right you make

790
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:28,980
money and you do good but then I heard

791
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,839
about the triple bottom line I'm like

792
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,519
what is this triple bottom line and it

793
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:34,079
seemed very theoretical to me until I

794
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:36,119
entered the Cannabis industry and to

795
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:37,558
this day it really motivates me Triple

796
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:39,839
bottom line is about yes you can make

797
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:41,519
money it's okay to make money two yes

798
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,740
you can do good you can like impact

799
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:46,440
patients three you can also actually be

800
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,880
a catalyst to change and I think that

801
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,798
there is an opportunity in the Cannabis

802
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:53,100
industry to do so on many levels I mean

803
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:55,379
ESG is one Element because it's still a

804
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:57,119
micro system that a global scale there

805
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,740
is an opportunity to test things and

806
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,259
then show their value and Effectiveness

807
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,819
and have they been adopted outside we've

808
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:05,038
seen it with innovation

809
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:06,240
so that's what excites me I'm a little

810
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:09,240
bit of a nerd

811
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,099
um okay I'm a lot of a nerd but um that

812
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,720
that application that there gets me

813
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:14,759
going and in terms of like how does it

814
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,679
affect all of you I'd be surprised if

815
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:20,038
not you're not all somehow thinking

816
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:22,380
about that and and or doing it so the

817
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:24,419
industry's doing it we're changing the

818
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:28,020
world it's frustrating it's a difficult

819
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:29,940
industry but I want all of you to really

820
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:31,579
first of all you know Pat yourselves on

821
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:34,980
the back I really can't say this enough

822
00:31:31,579 --> 00:31:37,139
you're here you spent money you came we

823
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,538
all have that passion in common and I

824
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:42,299
want to say thank you really genuinely

825
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:45,480
to the ICBC uh I've been coming to this

826
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:47,639
conference for six or seven years

827
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,380
um the fact that we've moved venues

828
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,960

this industry we have conversation

831
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:58,799
talking about legalization and we know

832
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:00,419
that legalization ends addiction to

833
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,579
opiates and addiction to alcohol and

834
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:04,919
