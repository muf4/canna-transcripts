um so a round of applause for the

51
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,199
panelists and before we dive into this

52
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,439
let's have a little bit of a look into

53
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,560
what a learning system is a learning

54
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:16,919
system is a system that allows you to

55
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,039
create manage organize and deliver

56
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:23,119
knowledge so um as we all know education

57
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,318
and educating on the cannabis plant is

58
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,640
one of the key factors of success uh for

59
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:31,399
our industry and also maybe um just uh

60
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:34,079
as a good example for a learning system

61
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,159
is the ICBC itself um because it's a

62
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,080
place where people can actively engage

63
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:41,639
and uh cultivate their knowledge um so

64
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,959
I'm very excited uh to for our panel

65
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:46,598
today and my first question of the day

66
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:49,080
goes to Deepak Deepak uh can you go a

67
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:51,079
little bit maybe explain to the audience

68
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,920
what kind of learning systems currently

69
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,560
exist in the Kus industry what is

70
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:58,719
missing and why are learning systems so

71
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,439
important to accelerate sustainable

72
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,120
growth

73
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:03,598
yeah look I mean thanks for having me

74
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,439
and and thanks for putting this together

75
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,479
I think that just a step back I think

76
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:10,959
education and learning is so important I

77
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:13,518
think as countries start to legislate

78
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,680
and legalize cannabis both for medical

79
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,360
and and non-medical purposes I think

80
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,360
it's really really important to have

81
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,640
knowledge sharing and information and

82
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,959
education uh there is a lot of Education

83
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:26,238
there's a lot of people that need to be

84
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,840
educated everyone from Regulators to you

85
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,759
know stakeholders to shareholders to uh

86
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,920
doctors to you know literally every

87
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:35,280
every single part of the value chain so

88
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:37,359
what exists now I mean there's a lot

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,959
that's happening across uh across the

90
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,080
world right so I think often when you

91
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,158
stay in Europe you you forget that there

92
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,000
is a number of countries you know Canada

93
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,919
the US that have gone down the path of

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,158
legalization and and have a lot of

95
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,158
experience in this and so there's a lot

96
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,878
that is actually available in terms of

97
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,519
educational content there's a number of

98
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:58,280
programs on a variety of different

99
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,759
sections of of the value chain whether

100
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,878
it be cultivation extraction testing

101
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:04,878
processing uh there's a lot that that's

102
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,840
available so it really depends on which

103
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:09,120
Market you're focusing on and it's not a

104
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,878
one- siiz fits-all solution but there is

105
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,400
quite a bit that exists so I think you

106
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,039
know the perfect system is really

107
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,799
blending what exists with what's

108
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:16,599
different about a market that you might

109
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,079
be

110
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,560
in thank you so let's move over to

111
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:25,079
Shauna um Shauna one of the uh things

112
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,199
that people often mix up our standards

113
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:29,399
and regulations can you maybe explain a

114
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,400
little bit what the difference is and

115
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:33,519
can you also maybe comment if there if

116
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:35,799
you think is there a global cannabis

117
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,799
standard or is it just like a set of

118
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,478
interpretations of

119
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,800
regulations yeah so very often times

120
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:45,519
when we talking about standards um a lot

121
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,038
of the partners or other cannabis

122
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,240
industry

123
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:51,038
members are concerned that these

124
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,680
standards are going to become

125
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:56,918
regulations and they're very confused on

126
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,840
what the difference is um a standard is

127
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:02,439
just a way of doing something a lot lot

128
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:04,359
of times they can be like bare minimum

129
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:05,839
requirements and sometimes they can be

130
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,560
more than that but a lot of times

131
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,758
they're very voluntary and a lot of

132
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,240
times there are things that you're

133
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,759
already doing it's just directing you to

134
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,918
do it uh a certain way over another one

135
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:22,038
so you know a great example is there's a

136
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:24,240
standard for the shape that a stop sign

137
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:26,120
should be right that's not specifically

138
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,960
written into a law like every stop sign

139
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,120
has to be a hexagon it has to be this

140
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,638
shade of red but it's written into a

141
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,160
standard so you're already a city is

142
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,680
already creating stop signs so might as

143
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,919
well create a stop sign that's the same

144
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,879
as the city next to them that's the same

145
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:43,198
as the state or country that that

146
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,839
borders them um so that's kind of how

147
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,960
standards are are implemented right it's

148
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:51,318
just like cohesion across uh different

149
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,719
locations um so everyone can kind of

150
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,840
understand it do you see a lot of Def

151
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,000
fragmented rules for that or is it like

152
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,959
one harmonous standard that you also see

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,519
develop or we can maybe talk also about

154
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:04,918
the segments a little bit so I think

155
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,839
right now it's very disjointed uh cuz

156
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:09,519
cannabis is a very new industry um we

157
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,198
haven't been around for very long like

158
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:14,879
as a regulated industry um where if you

159
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:18,639
look at other Industries you know like

160
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:20,038
Ceramics or uh construction they have

161
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,720
standards that everyone follows but

162
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:23,959
they've been around for over a hundred

163
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,479
years so it does take time for these

164
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:29,198
cohesive standards to get created um a

165
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:31,360
great platform that is creating them ISM

166
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,919
which and I are both a part of and

167
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,960
anyone can become a member of ASM it's

168
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:40,758
also a very low cost uh of Entry which

169
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:42,560
is great um and all the members

170
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:46,000
contribute to standards so you have to

171
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,120
get buyin from consumers and from

172
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,240
industry manufacturers um and there's

173
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:55,079
even Regulators that join so it's a very

174
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,680
valuable platform to get cohesive buying

175
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:00,120
so that we will all be following the

176
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,439
same standards in the future but for

177
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,598
different

178
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,279
areas yeah yeah it's all broken down

179
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:08,120
into different areas yeah so John where

180
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:09,719
do you see the testing standards uh

181
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,280
moving globally which countries have

182
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,240
good testing standards uh which do not

183
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:17,399
uh or may need some improvement and um

184
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,759
for which segments of the Cannabis

185
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:22,519
industry do you think uh standards are

186
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,840
most important to be set yeah that's a

187
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:25,878
first of all thank you for inviting us

188
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,598
here to to Canada from Canada here to be

189
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,360
able to speak the European market it's

190
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,159
you know as we look at it you know deepo

191
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,598
talk talked about it right there go and

192
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,240
get a license right now you now have a

193
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:35,719
German medicinal license your cannabis

194
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,160
is probably coming from Canada and it

195
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,639
was probably tested through high North

196
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,280
and I probably have the COA so it's

197
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,160
we're seeing these standards as they go

198
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:44,719
around the world and change you know for

199
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,439
us in Canada we have 17 pharmacopia we

200
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,440
test to that's because all the countries

201
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:49,879
around the world in fact aren't going

202
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:51,719
together they're actually drifting apart

203
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:53,240
if we look at the difference between uh

204
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,120
sending something to Israel or send

205
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,759
something to Australia the difference in

206
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,120
not only the pharmacopia but the testing

207
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:02,080
needed are drastically further apart and

208
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,759
I don't think for me in Canada it's fine

209
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,000
because I can be this Swiss army knife

210
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,080
that can be whatever you need it to be

211
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,439
and Export to every country but I I

212
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:11,598
really don't think The Regulators have

213
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:14,360
really thought about and taken a step

214
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:16,279
back to say I want to make really strict

215
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,919
guidelines for cannabis for this country

216
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:21,679
it's like great but now not one lab in

217
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,478
your entire country can actually test to

218
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,720
those standards without millions of

219
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:27,478
dollars of investment during a time in

220
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,280
which it's in its infancy and nobody's

221
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:31,839
going to want to do that investment so

222
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,079
you almost hamstrung every single one of

223
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:36,879
these cultivators that's trying to get

224
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,599
this 2 million squ foot operation off

225
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:41,519
the ground using a lab that they can

226
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,360
barely get access to that they're

227
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,560
getting data back from that they

228
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,159
question every time that's often like 25

229
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,199
30 days later than they need to be

230
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:53,240
getting it and it's those regulations

231
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:56,040
seem smart off the bat but just e adding

232
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,720
something like bromide to your pesticide

233
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,360
testing that just caused a $1.5 million

234
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,879
investment to whatever laboratory now

235
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,480
has to test that that's because you're

236
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:06,078
doing a second run you're using another

237
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,480
lcms your most expensive machine is now

238
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:11,278
being run and if you think about how

239
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,680
important a laboratory is especially in

240
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,600
those early days that's your dashboard

241
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,479
of your car every morning you get in

242
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,600
your car the speedometer as people know

243
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,720
in Canada it might say it's 80 you're

244
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,519
actually driving 62 and you need to

245
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,320
think about that calculation cuz my labs

246
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,200
always give me back THC scores that are

247
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,640
higher it's like coming in in every

248
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,560
single one of the lights being on in

249
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,159
your car and you just ignoring those

250
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:34,439
lights well those lights could be hop

251
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:36,559
lat and virus spreading across your

252
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,120
entire lab entire facility but if the

253
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:41,039
lab is giving you back results saying

254
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:44,039
it's clean it's clean and there you go

255
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,719
you press on not having that data I

256
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:48,480
think it it not only it seems like a

257
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,120
good idea it seems like you've added

258
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,639
good standards but what you've really

259
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,720
done is you've limited The Limited the

260
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,838
Laboratories and literally blinded The

261
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,759
Growers and I think it's just you're set

262
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:02,000
up to cause the longest curve to able to

263
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,600
get up and actually get functional in

264
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,799
that market not happening plain is

265
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,680
simply not happening and if you want to

266
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:11,039
talk about where this goes bad it's the

267
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:14,039
Legacy Market taking over it's products

268
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,480
coming in that are 100% untested because

269
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:17,759
the only ones that are hitting people's

270
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,120
hands that are actually being smoked are

271
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,559
not from your legal market so you feel

272
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,440
like you've added good standards but

273
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:25,278
what you've really done you've lagged

274
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,920
the legal clean industry and you've

275
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:28,879
given a jump start to the backside of

276
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:31,240
the industry the worst example is the

277
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:34,078
Netherlands love to dunk on them for

278
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,759
this because go into any place in there

279
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:37,439
any coffee shop you feel like what

280
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,559
you're getting is good weed whatever it

281
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,880
might be good weed it's not tested it's

282
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:43,399
plain and simply not tested and and

283
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:45,838
every single place you go to none of

284
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:47,559
that stuff is tested so great place to

285
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,040
go for vacation and smoke some weed but

286
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:50,439
your your pesticides could be off there

287
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,679
could be heavy metals they could be alot

288
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,079
toxins you have no idea I think it's a

289
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:57,159
requirement for the new uh cannabis that

290
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:59,679
is provided through the pilot programs

291
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:01,278
that they do testing yeah but agree with

292
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,879
the Cannabis that is from illicit

293
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:04,838
sources and the thing is right now if

294
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,320
you look at past what 20 30 years have

295
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:08,880
you've been going to a coffee shop in

296
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,920
Amsterdam you're you're smoking 100% on

297
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,679
tested

298
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:15,399
cannabis I mean um we're talking about

299
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:17,759
also different uh areas where um

300
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,919
standards and testing standards like

301
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,639
become relevant for cultivation for

302
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,439
manufacturing for all those kind of

303
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:26,480
things so um I know that they have been

304
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,200
discussing Global medicinal cannabis

305
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,680
standards in the international narcotic

306
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:34,040
control board in 21 but I have not

307
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:37,278
personally seen a lot of development um

308
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:39,599
so shaa uh who is really developing the

309
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:41,639
global cannabis standards are we as an

310
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,560
industry developing those are The

311
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,680
Regulators who who are the people really

312
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:48,239
developing the Cannabis

313
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:51,159
standard so the people that are

314
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,000
currently developing standards have been

315
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:55,919
The Regulators um there are you know

316
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,200
global standard groups like ASM that I

317
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:01,199
mentioned um but those standards take

318
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,480
time um because it's such a thorough

319
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,720
process um so they take time to come to

320
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,839
place do I think Regulators are the best

321
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,959
people to create standards no um

322
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,639
oftentimes we see Regulators don't have

323
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:17,239
a lot of knowledge on the Cannabis

324
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,198
industry nor do they have any firsthand

325
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,759
experience in the Cannabis industry um

326
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:27,639
and so I think we're going to see a lot

327
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:29,919
of regulators are writing laws that are

328
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:31,440
often times different than

329
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:33,078
what has already been placed in other

330
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,160
countries or other states they think oh

331
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:36,439
we can do it better they saw pitfalls

332
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:39,000
here and they're like let me try it

333
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,120
differently um so I think what we might

334
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,519
see in the future is Regulators try what

335
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:48,320
they think is best it doesn't work out

336
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,078
they realize it like it takes time for

337
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,600
them to admit that maybe I don't know

338
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:55,359
what's best and then they'll direct to

339
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,920
these Global standards um and you knowm

340
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,278
is one but I know there's other ones I

341
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:59,958
don't know if deug if you know other

342
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,639
ones yeah I think from a European

343
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,399
perspective it's important to understand

344
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:05,399
right so far there's been no single

345
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,720
monograph even on flower right and it's

346
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,159
been a long time coming I know now

347
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,680
there's a lot of work that's going into

348
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:12,799
creating you know a monograph to

349
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:14,879
Sunflower so there certainly seems to be

350
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,559
more harmonization occurring I mean

351
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,838
that's the whole fundamental of the

352
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,439
European Union generally so it's

353
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,480
unfortunate that we still see a very

354
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,440
much a country bycount approach within

355
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,959
Europe uh and that's you know one of the

356
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,920
one of the biggest challenges because if

357
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:29,599
you're a cultivator in Canada or

358
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,439
Portugal or or anywhere and you're

359
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,399
trying to service you know Denmark

360
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,839
Poland Germany and the UK you have four

361
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,519
completely different set of regulations

362
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,160
that you need to follow just because

363
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,639
there's no harmonization of regulations

364
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:43,120
or even you know a monograph right so I

365
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:44,519
think having a monograph which now

366
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,799
there's a lot of work happening at the

367
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,159
the European uh Union level and finally

368
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,000
hopefully we'll see a monograph on

369
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,559
flower but those sorts of things

370
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,120
actually need to happen because it

371
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:54,399
creates a lot of pressure on the supply

372
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,399
chain right so for example you look at

373
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,360
Denmark no one's supplying to Denmark

374
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,039
really now because at one time there was

375
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,560
a lot of hype but really if you

376
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,198
understand the Danish regulations you

377
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:05,758
actually need to reverse engineer your

378
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,719
your cultivation room to be able to

379
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,240
exclude certain pesticides an example to

380
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,600
be able to sell in that market so

381
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,440
there's a real requirement for

382
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,360
harmonization unfortunately in the EU I

383
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,560
do agree with China Regulators aren't

384
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,839
necessarily the best placed but

385
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:19,559
unfortunately in the EU the way things

386
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:20,759
work is it is regulator driven uh but

387
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,319
there's a lot of companies now that are

388
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,039
giving feedback to the European Union on

389
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,920
Flow and I think more of that actually

390
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:28,759
needs to happen um the next question

391
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:30,799
would have been also in that regard uh

392
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:32,199
like I have my background in facility

393
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:34,240
management for me it's every light

394
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:36,198
switch has a code basically and

395
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,720
everything is standardized so uh coming

396
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:40,599
into the Cannabis industry um I saw that

397
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,720
there are not many standards and I mean

398
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,360
also from your experience as an

399
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,759
entrepreneur um we often see do you also

400
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,720
see that that like these pharmacological

401
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,680
regular standard systems like to many

402
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,519
they are a book of Seven Seals that have

403
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:55,519
to be

404
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:57,000
learned and don't make sense right like

405
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,000
for example you look at Switzerland this

406
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,120
you know whole organic requirement on

407
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,519
cannabis cultivation you know there's

408
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,440
certain things from a regulatory

409
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,839
perspective it isn't clear what The

410
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,920
Regulators were thinking when they were

411
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:09,079
going to start to launch these products

412
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:10,519
often times they self- serving but like

413
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:13,000
that is definitely part of the challenge

414
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:14,720
is that regulations sometimes are shaped

415
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,440
in a way that aren't necessarily

416
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,879
fostering to cannabis as a product

417
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,480
because yes it's a pharmaceutical

418
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:21,879
product in some instances but it's not

419
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,800
exactly the same as tobacco or the same

420
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:26,480
as Pharma it's you know it's a unique uh

421
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,519
kind of plant and it needs a unique set

422
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,720
of Regulation sometimes and and that's

423
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:30,959
one of the things from on the testing

424
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,000
side you see that all the time you could

425
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:36,758
grab any one of the tests heavy metals

426
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,159
for example you know it says use a

427
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:43,199
pharmacopia for your heavy metals and

428
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:45,039
justify it okay there are 10 so could or

429
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,159
am I going to go the high side the low

430
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:49,958
side it is how many grams per day am I

431
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:51,838
doing am I using tea as my analogy and

432
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:53,318
saying well it's like tea well how many

433
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,120
grams of tea am I having in a day

434
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:56,838
equivalent to cannabis therefore what

435
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,000
that would that be for my heavy metals

436
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:01,000
then as you take that and go to export

437
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,679
the broker might say no actually I

438
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,278
wanted one tenth that because I'm taking

439
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:09,799
that 10 G instead of one it it you're

440
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:11,720
you're giving because of the lack of of

441
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:13,919
like nailing down these things that deac

442
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,519
was getting into you've literally put it

443
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,679
back into the industry as a question

444
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:20,198
that the broker essentially has to

445
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:22,278
handle because they're the one that has

446
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:24,679
to get it into the country so they'll go

447
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:26,720
back to the health CID person go like so

448
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:28,159
is it this is it that okay yeah guess

449
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,440
what guys you're testing zinc now and it

450
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,159
needs to be over this level it's like

451
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,160
okay well I guess we're testing zinc now

452
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:37,759
right so it it it really is it is so

453
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:39,759
fluid right now and and it's not really

454
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,879
that fluid is going in absolutely all

455
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,440
directions uh I mean it's interesting

456
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:45,198
that you say that because we have that

457
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,560
discussion here a lot for the clubs in

458
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:49,719
Germany um is it going to be food

459
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:51,638
standard is it going to be farmer grade

460
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,079
standard or agricultural standard that

461
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,600
we're sticking or we have our own

462
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:57,359
solution how important are analytical

463
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,360
testing standards especially for the

464
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,399
start of the legalization and maybe what

465
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,839
are some lessons learned that we can

466
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:05,880
take here when uh when lobbying for

467
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,038
those causes what is important and what

468
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,760
criteria should be used I I I I think

469
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:12,199
it's the the you know to kind of build

470
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:14,318
on that point there of pharmaceutical it

471
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,959
cannabis is a living plant it's going to

472
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:18,798
have micros on it so if you try to go no

473
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,759
microbials no nothing on top of this

474
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:21,558
this thing's going to be a dead plant

475
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:23,199
you're leading down to radiation if

476
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:25,000
you've done that you've now created a

477
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,120
whole other industry of a radiation that

478
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,200
needs to be coming up out of this you

479
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,319
know wherever you are if it's whatever

480
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,279
country you're in you now not only need

481
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:35,399
labs to be putting in massive money to

482
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:36,960
be investing into more testing standards

483
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,720
but now all of a sudden you're adding a

484
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,200
radiation facilities all the way across

485
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,279
your place so that you could be close to

486
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,160
an a radiation facility to get it down

487
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:46,519
to zero microbes so you can get it out

488
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,480
the door some of these things just plain

489
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:50,400
and simply don't make sense and I think

490
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,120
it's because we have to go back to a

491
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,960
pharmacopia that makes sense to us but

492
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,839
inside of that you're like 98% of that

493
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,159
pharmacopia makes sense but 2% doesn't

494
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:00,918
but that's the best one I can can go

495
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:04,200
with right now until there really is one

496
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:07,240
that matches cannabis you are you are

497
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,840
setting people up to grow in different

498
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,240
completely different standards and this

499
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:13,079
is one of the things that I worry about

500
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,880
when I hear um you know a top Canadian

501
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:18,439
grower has just moved over to wherever

502
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,400
new country of of of whatever it is it

503
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,400
to some of them it's like you've taken

504
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,798
an F1 racer that was in an F1 car and

505
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,360
you just dropped them into a l with all

506
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:30,759
the gauges flashing and you're saying BN

507
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:32,719
F1 racer it's like buddy like I don't

508
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:34,119
even the gauges aren't working like it's

509
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,679
the track looks different like how do

510
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:37,879
you expect me to be the F1 racer that I

511
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,320
want me to be right so that that

512
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,880
definition really does it sets the

513
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,480
Cannabis facilities especially the

514
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,440
Growers up for failure day one

515
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,319
absolutely day one if I can just add one

516
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,480
more piece to what John said I think you

517
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:52,399
know you look at irradiation even as one

518
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,159
example you know in Europe you need to

519
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,559
comply with uh you know safety for

520
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:58,440
inhalation which is typically on the

521
00:18:55,558 --> 00:19:00,119
monograph 5.1.4 and there's different

522
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,440
ways to reach that right so in Germany

523
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:03,639
for example if you're trying to sell a

524
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,200
product with that compliance you you

525
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,640
need to irradiate and then you need to

526
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,960
be able to get something called an amrad

527
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,960
F an amrad 5 license and that takes you

528
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,600
know anywhere from 9 to 12 months to be

529
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,558
able to get but now people are actually

530
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:16,558
trying to see ways to get around that

531
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,158
process and you know some people are

532
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:19,839
using steam some people are using you

533
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:22,240
know a variety of different things and

534
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:23,879
it leads to non-compliance in some in

535
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,759
some cases and actually fooling the

536
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,120
regulator in some cases so really you're

537
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:28,319
not creating best standards for the

538
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,759
industry cuz people are just trying to

539
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,720
figure out how to get around 5.1.4

540
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:35,798
they're not best practices but best work

541
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,319
around exactly exactly and and that that

542
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:39,440
that exact literally you you literally

543
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:42,319
nailed on that inhalation one it's a

544
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,038
perfect one it even if you could create

545
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,439
a cannabis operation that could work

546
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:48,119
under this legally great you're under it

547
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,440
who's going to want that product around

548
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:51,158
around the rest of the country so great

549
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,200
you've created something that only your

550
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:54,760
local Market's going to want to consume

551
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,038
and it's never going to be exported

552
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,558
every country CU you're going to go to

553
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:59,079
other countries and you're going to Beed

554
00:19:57,558 --> 00:20:01,000
against people that aren't using

555
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:02,359
inhalation as their as their monograph

556
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,079
which means that the product's not going

557
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:05,759
to be radiated which means it's going to

558
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,480
get to you faster it's going to be

559
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,440
fresher it's not going to be as dried

560
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,200
out like there's a lot of little things

561
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,200
even if you said my radiation barely

562
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,640
even degrades my product it still added

563
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,480
6 weeks to everything and 6E old weed is

564
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,520
still sixe old weed and it's not like it

565
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,759
was handled well during that process

566
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,798
it's going to be a degraded product on

567
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,000
the global market versus other people

568
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:26,440
that don't have to sit under that

569
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,200
standard again you're setting your

570
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,320
country up to fail yeah what they're

571
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,600
talking about is essentially unintended

572
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:35,599
consequences right Regulators come in

573
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,798
they say something and they don't have

574
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:41,279
an understanding of the big picture so

575
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:44,119
like um John mentioned adding bromide to

576
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:46,678
it and or or maybe lowering an action

577
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:49,519
limit of something and they don't

578
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:51,759
understand that that means now the lab

579
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:53,440
has to redo their whole analytical

580
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,079
methods maybe they need to get new

581
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,120
analytical instruments and then they're

582
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:59,359
farther and farther behind from

583
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,879
providing compliant products to

584
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:04,599
Consumers and the whole idea behind best

585
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:07,440
practices and learning systems should be

586
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:09,839
to allow consumers to participate in the

587
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,880
regulated Marketplace that should be the

588
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:16,359
goal and often times they don't match

589
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,520
that goal that's very true I mean um sha

590
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:21,158
you are also working with tpin a lot uh

591
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:24,759
in the German phop cannabis is basically

592
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:28,200
THC and CBD and that's it um should um

593
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:30,519
tpin and other cannabinoid um content

594
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,278
also play a more wide role in this or

595
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:33,278
would they limit

596
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:40,720
us I would say Turpin and other

597
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:45,038
cannaboids they play a role in the

598
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:48,319
product and uh consumer choices and uh

599
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:51,079
consumer experience of the product um

600
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,879
but I I wouldn't want to see Regulators

601
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:54,759
come in and try to regulate based on

602
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,720
those materials it's very complex

603
00:21:54,759 --> 00:22:00,440
there's a lot of compounds in there um

604
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,319
and you know Regulators will more often

605
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,600
than not get things wrong but what I'd

606
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:07,399
love to see is for

607
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:10,158
manufacturers to take a voluntary

608
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,919
approach and do tpine analysis and maybe

609
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,159
list the top three or the top five tpin

610
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:16,679
on the product packaging and that just

611
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:19,640
allows the consumers to have more

612
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:20,880
information and to make a choice um that

613
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,559
you know fits better with what

614
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,440
experience they're going for Deepak what

615
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:28,079
are some other Lessons Learned for like

616
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,278
especially in that regard yeah I think I

617
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,158
I think I would take this back right I

618
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:33,000
think uh often Regulators are looking at

619
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:34,240
THC and CBD because it's the big thing

620
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,880
but not looking at what consumers

621
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,919
actually want and if you look at what

622
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,480
consumers want the trend is towards CVG

623
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,159
and CBN and thcv and you know a variety

624
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,960
of other new cannaboids right and so

625
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,278
consumers are always going to get that

626
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,079
whether it be from the the Legacy or the

627
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:50,278
or the legal market right so I think

628
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,519
it's very important when framing

629
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:54,079
cannabis regulations to understand that

630
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:56,440
this is very much a process and not an

631
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:57,960
event so you you as a regulator need to

632
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,600
keep on top of what's happening in the

633
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,519
industry and be able to go through that

634
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:05,119
process and improve and be able to add

635
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:07,519
other cannaboids so I don't necess think

636
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,678
regulating them to the same level is

637
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,679
necessarily the best thing because

638
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:12,080
there's different risks with different

639
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,798
cannaboids you'll see workarounds in hhc

640
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:17,439
which is a really hot topic in in Europe

641
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:19,278
now and yeah exactly so I mean started

642
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,000
don't get me started oh you have to keep

643
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:22,640
on top of consumer Trends and be able to

644
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,599
give consumers what they want because

645
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,440
otherwise they're just going to get it

646
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,678
somewhere else that that is a perfect

647
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,679
example of a work around hhc and all the

648
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,120
rest of these things you have forced

649
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,120
people to to play with wacky chemistry

650
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:36,319
to be able to get to something that

651
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:38,839
delivers the same in the end you have

652
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,839
just inside of that process you have

653
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:42,798
introduced new chemicals that are not

654
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:45,319
being tested they're flying through the

655
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:48,240
product tell me that that hhc product if

656
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:49,759
it was truly created hhc it's going to

657
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,599
have additional analytes inside of it

658
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:53,679
you've just essentially added something

659
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:57,000
to a very natural and gorgeous product

660
00:23:53,679 --> 00:24:00,159
so no yeah agree under no circumstance

661
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,960
no thank you Thank You

662
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,600
Preach so uh maybe as a last question

663
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,558
before we open the floor for the

664
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:10,719
audience um is uh to all of you um how

665
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:13,319
can we as the industry enable more

666
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,400
learning systems and how can we actively

667
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:18,558
engage in the development of standards

668
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,559
and why should we be motivated as

669
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:23,558
stakehold us to actively engage maybe

670
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:26,599
start with you

671
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:28,960
shaa um I think the first step of

672
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:31,439
creating Learning Systems is to share

673
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,079
your information um I know this is like

674
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,558
a for-profit industry and so you want to

675
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:38,558
kind of keep your secret sauce to

676
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:41,519
yourself but the only way to educate

677
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:43,678
Regulators or um you know create these

678
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,960
Learning Systems educate consumers Etc

679
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,440
is to share the information that you

680
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,919
have like there's a lot of knowledge

681
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,880
people have been working with cannabis

682
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,159
for decades um you know before the

683
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,399
regulated market came to play and so

684
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:58,840
there's knowledge that needs to be

685
00:24:57,398 --> 00:25:01,759
shared um

686
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:03,639
and and accessible a lot of uh

687
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:05,480
information is hidden behind pay walls

688
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,919
unfortunately um so I think it would be

689
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,240
great if people created like a database

690
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,200
that had these you know PDFs to these

691
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,558
papers that are typically hidden behind

692
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,640
pay walls um to be accessible to

693
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,240
everyone that'd be fantastic um but yeah

694
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,600
but many scientists also hand out the

695
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,079
papers if you contact them usually they

696
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:25,240
give you the paper yeah I've done that

697
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:28,359
I've direct emailed professors and said

698
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:31,519
hey can I can you send me your paper and

699
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:33,879
almost every single time they do no

700
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:35,398
problem so deak what do you think how

701
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,440
can we create better learning systems

702
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:38,798
for the Cannabis industry yeah look I

703
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,120
think it's all about working together

704
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:41,639
right I think what happens and what I

705
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:43,239
see in this industry particularly is

706
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,200
people start to get competitive very

707
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,000
quickly and meanwhile we haven't even

708
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,840
started you know scratching the surface

709
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,798
with respect to where this plant is and

710
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:52,519
where regulations are you know I think

711
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:54,119
we can all agree that the Cannabis

712
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:56,798
industry is only going to grow from here

713
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:58,319
where we are at today in 2024 is very

714
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:00,000
much the start of the industry as a

715
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,960
opposed to you know being a mature phase

716
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,640
there's going to be way more consumption

717
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,399
of cannabis that occurs on a global

718
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,960
basis so we got to be able to work

719
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:08,398
together as an industry I agree with sha

720
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,519
completely it's there are certain

721
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:12,278
competitive aspects but if you're not

722
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:13,639
going to start to engage regulators and

723
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:15,440
not going to start to create learning

724
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,640
management system and education

725
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,679
platforms and share information it's

726
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,520
just going to make everyone's job harder

727
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,360
particularly the regulator and when

728
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:25,158
you're coming forward as an industry you

729
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:26,719
need to have a collective collaborative

730
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:28,360
voice so that you're able to make

731
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,759
meaningful change with regulators

732
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:32,079
because the last thing Regulators want

733
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,200
to see is an industry that's disjointed

734
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:35,599
and not speaking from a from a single

735
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,120
voice I think it's very important to

736
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,839
share learnings with each other and

737
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:40,479
actually be able to have conversations

738
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:42,959
like this and others uh to be able to

739
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,839
bring out that information yeah yeah I

740
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,159
always say we need trust honesty

741
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:49,319
collaboration

742
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,640
THC so I'm using that I'm using that

743
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:53,200
nobody else heard that from Canada I'm

744
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,880
using that um it's it's it's funny that

745
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,480
it when I think about the groups that

746
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,880
I've seen historically that have put

747
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,599
together some of these regulations

748
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,360
there's someone from the lab side on

749
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,959
Pharma useless sorry useless the two two

750
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:05,599
analytes go inside of a pharmaceutical

751
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,159
product the obsp and the drug it's the

752
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:08,719
easiest thing in the world to test wrong

753
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:11,159
person to be on that panel there should

754
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,519
be one person in a hoodie I'm sorry that

755
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:15,159
there should be a master grower from

756
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:17,079
somewhere that is in a hoodie that gets

757
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:18,720
it that has been there growing it for 20

758
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:20,359
years there's not one person on that

759
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,278
table in a hoodie guy or girl I've seen

760
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:24,319
amazing female Growers out there there

761
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:26,159
should be one because that is the one

762
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,200
side of this that I think when you get

763
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,880
to the end of these regulations you go

764
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,798
this is the rag I want and and then go

765
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,278
back to zinc and they'll go but every

766
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:37,319
plant has zinc so let's just throw that

767
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,599
law in the garbage you know every every

768
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:41,319
plant has microbials so you know it

769
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,719
would be good to take these regulations

770
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:45,519
go back to a grower and say show me you

771
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,558
can grow this before I tell the world

772
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,558
that this is the regulation show me

773
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:51,319
you're an amazing grower I have no doubt

774
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:53,639
in your skills you're so tuned in you

775
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:55,599
have a great operation prove to me you

776
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,360
can grow to this standard cuz right now

777
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:59,719
if you can't I have list literally

778
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:01,759
created the possible scenario that

779
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,480
nobody could grow into so that's the one

780
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:07,000
thing I think we we do have a rich group

781
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,720
of people uh inside of over the world

782
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,038
that I've talked to and I'll tell you

783
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,558
every once in a while I'll have a

784
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:13,558
conversation with somebody that starts

785
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:16,440
you know in a weird tangent by the time

786
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:18,079
you're done you're like that's brilliant

787
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,840
I don't know how that has never come to

788
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:21,759
light and how do I bring you into bring

789
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:24,480
to this conversation because you've gone

790
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,879
down a path for 25 years growing

791
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,640
outdoors in this scenario with this and

792
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,080
that and you found ways of getting

793
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,320
everything to work you need to be a part

794
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:33,759
of this conversation so more hoodies at

795
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:37,038
the round table that'll

796
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:37,038
help yes

797
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:44,000
yes so um ah yes Z I'm right here let's

798
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,880
hear for our panelists first of all

799
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,519
question yes questions do you have a

800
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,640
question no the audience I see this

801
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:52,679
person has their hand up I always tell

802
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,320
people all the time uh you know if

803
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:56,200
you're a suit find a hippie if you're a

804
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,599
hippie find a suit correct and then we

805
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:02,519
can all work together yep everybody all

806
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:05,038
at once thank you um hold it close to

807
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:08,359
your face yes sir uh one of the things I

808
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:09,839
want to ask is uh we're speaking about

809
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:13,839
for example the uh

810
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:15,599
SCM and teaching a teaching platform uh

811
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:18,519
and what John just said earlier you need

812
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:19,959
somebody in a hoodie um but not is

813
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:23,120
there's a disconnect between the

814
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:26,640
industry and the consumer um there's

815
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:29,558
also not everybody speaks cannabis okay

816
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,600
uh uh please don't uh some uh doctors

817
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:34,720
don't speak cannabis so is there a way

818
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:38,678
other than you know just teaching uh

819
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:44,200
grow uh Growers or the um

820
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:46,080
Regulators um I'm sorry uh on how what

821
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,159
steps or what they need to take into

822
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:51,480
account uh for the reg regulation to go

823
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:53,399
through as far as you need to have

824
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,798
everybody not just somebody in a hoodie

825
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:58,000
you need somebody in the uh in police in

826
00:29:55,798 --> 00:30:01,798
Department you need uh yes you do need

827
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,038
far but you also need a priest you know

828
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:06,359
uh I would love the pope to say cannabis

829
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:09,200
is okay and it's just a domino effect

830
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:11,918
but that's another subject

831
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,159
for what are your thoughts on that I

832
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:17,440
would like to get high with the

833
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:19,039
Pope it's we can solve a lot of problems

834
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,399
like I think I think what you're you

835
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:21,519
kind of get back to this big problem

836
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:23,599
that we talk about in Canada which is

837
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,200
removing the stigma and I think you know

838
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:26,798
if you want to say where does where does

839
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,600
the the removal of the stigma start it

840
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:31,000
starts with you and you and you and you

841
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:32,759
and you and you and you it starts with

842
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,960
uh telling your grandma she be take she

843
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:36,599
should be taking CBD oil it you know it

844
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,360
it goes to that person who can't sleep

845
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:39,959
at night you know what CBN really works

846
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:42,359
really well like I think you know

847
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,759
keeping that conversation and keeping it

848
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:46,639
um a serious conversation at that level

849
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:48,240
helps for that kind of remove the stigma

850
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,440
how you get to the Pope I I'll throw

851
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,919
that down the panel cuz uh I myself am

852
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,640
not a religious person so I don't know

853
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,679
much but there you

854
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,960
go yeah I mean in general it's super

855
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:00,480
important that we like um I always say

856
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,278
the people who have the money should

857
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,000
give the money to the people who do the

858
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:07,079
work AKA your local activists so you

859
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,278
should all Support also engaging those

860
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:11,720
kind of in initiative who engage and

861
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:13,519
people who do the education like Misha

862
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,960
yeah and maybe support some of those

863
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,638
activities and that we we can really see

864
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,440
where the information gets into the

865
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:21,519
system and so we can create the learning

866
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,120
systems at all yeah if you if you if you

867
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,558
look at the nutriceutical industry a new

868
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:27,599
neutral comes out every couple years but

869
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:30,200
it takes s years before people are like

870
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:32,359
you know what Kirin actually works it

871
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,480
actually works but Kirin and turmeric

872
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:36,199
have been around here for 20 years Kirin

873
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,079
was was isolated about 10 years ago

874
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,120
inside of products even that product

875
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:41,759
that has no Stigma before before it

876
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:43,879
actually sinks in and people go yeah it

877
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,679
works it takes a very long time and I

878
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,200
think the patient side of it and the

879
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,639
kind of uh the constant hit of water is

880
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,798
you know water defeats Rock not by being

881
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:54,398
strong but by being consistent so and I

882
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:55,679
think that's that's kind of the the path

883
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:57,918
we need to take here as we look at that

884
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,720
stigma and breaking that down I think

885
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:03,120
just sharing personal stories is so

886
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,079
valuable um you know I come up here and

887
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,879
I talk about regulations and safety and

888
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:10,199
all that jazz but what really hits home

889
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:12,960
is hearing stories of how cannabis has

890
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,639
helped people um so share your story and

891
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,360
that'll encourage the next person to

892
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:18,119
share their story and that's how it

893
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:20,599
spreads and that's how you get Buy in

894
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:22,278
from all different groups of individuals

895
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:24,199
can I just make a Counterpoint to that I

896
00:32:22,278 --> 00:32:25,599
think you know education is more about

897
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,399
you know teaching and learning and I

898
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:28,398
think as much as we need to be teaching

899
00:32:27,398 --> 00:32:30,158
which I agree

900
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:31,879
I agree with I think we also need to be

901
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,679
learning we know that cannabis is not a

902
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,480
benign substance we know that has some

903
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,278
risk I think we as an industry need to

904
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:39,360
be open to be able to also having that

905
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:40,599
conversation let's actually properly

906
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:42,199
understand the risks right that are

907
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:43,480
associated with cannabis because you

908
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,000
lack complete credibility when you're

909
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,960
coming from a one-way perspective in

910
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,359
terms of how great everything is and

911
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,079
certainly there's a number of great

912
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:51,599
things but I also think we need to be

913
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:53,599
receptive to learning about some of the

914
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:55,519
risks right and that's where countries

915
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:57,278
like Canada are doing a lot of work in

916
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,759
terms of gathering data what has the

917
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:00,880
impact been into driving what's the

918
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:02,519
impact being underage access you know

919
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,080
and and and it's it's there's pros and

920
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:06,159
cons there I think generally things are

921
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:07,678
moving really well but there are certain

922
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,480
aspects that we may need to tweak such

923
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,038
as age of access so I think it's

924
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,558
important to be receptive and also learn

925
00:33:12,038 --> 00:33:17,200
from others uh in this industry I agree

926
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:19,678
uh 100% um there's something I call it

927
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,120
uh the educated decision so we should

928
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,880
enable an educated decision and that's

929
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:25,839
only possible if you know all different

930
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,960
aspects I mean there are a lot of

931
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:31,879
studies from all over all the time I'm

932
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:35,759
constantly going back 20 30 almost 40

933
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:37,480
years U showing the E efficacy of

934
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,000
cannabis and I think when you're dealing

935
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,319
with the scientist you maybe want to get

936
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,759
these studies into their hands but also

937
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:45,319
you know it's just an uphill battle you

938
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:48,119
got to fight 80 years of propaganda

939
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:50,079
every time every time and and it's so

940
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:52,839
you have to go so individually there's

941
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:54,918
no magic wand that you can wave and

942
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:58,240
everybody will get it right away but you

943
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:59,759
know I if it were easy I guess it would

944
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,679
be done

945
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:03,038
already all right we have two more

946
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,720
minutes you have two more minutes is

947
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:06,759
there would you like to sing a song can

948
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,000
no but maybe we have one more question

949
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:09,679
okay we have one more question Dereck

950
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,239
always asking I'm not such a good singer

951
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,599
so I don't

952
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:16,000
know as as an exception I don't have a

953
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,320
question but I do uh feel it as a

954
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,039
challenge because John know dump dumped

955
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,800
on the Dutch and I'm Dutch

956
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:24,519
so the point you make is true most of

957
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,879
the the coffee shop weeds not tested at

958
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:28,960
all but I think people should understand

959
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:31,878
it's actually forbidden by law for a

960
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,878
coffee shop to get we tested so and

961
00:34:31,878 --> 00:34:36,118
there are some coffee shops they started

962
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:37,639
about four or five years ago

963
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:40,399
basically

964
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:42,440
Illy uh so illegally having the weed

965
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:44,199
tested but they still do it because they

966
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,559
they want to have that service for the

967
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:47,918
for the customer so it's not that they

968
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:50,078
don't want it it's that they cannot do

969
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:51,440
it it's one so my brother actually lives

970
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,679
in the Netherlands and it wasn't until I

971
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,838
went over there and I was like oh [ __ ]

972
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,440
this is how it works but it's like it's

973
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:59,000
it you know for me it was like oh maybe

974
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,079
you know they sell they sell weed in

975
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,280
other ones maybe we'll put a lab here

976
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,480
I'm like no they can't even test like

977
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,000
it's just it was just such a

978
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,280
mind-blowing experience to me to that

979
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,280
years people have been coming to these

980
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,000
coffee shops years you know the amount

981
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,920
of times I hear right now that's like if

982
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,599
I could get my hands on that original

983
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,720
skunk seed from Amsterdam cross it with

984
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:20,559
my ice cream cake and my gelato I've got

985
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,439
fire you know we're still looking back

986
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,759
at the Netherlands as these like you

987
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,280
know like uh like the pyramids like it's

988
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,240
like wow how did they build these things

989
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,040
like wow this is amazing but today it's

990
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:31,199
like Egypt's not even part of the global

991
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:32,320
economy is what we're doing all the rest

992
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:33,799
of these things yet we're looking back

993
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,359
to these things that's what I'm worried

994
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,160
about with the Netherlands it's like you

995
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:40,719
had this point you had this point and

996
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:42,799
you could have literally been the spot

997
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:44,838
that everything became a jump Point like

998
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,640
could I take give me the same don't rub

999
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:47,920
it in that oh no I'm going to rub it in

1000
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:49,318
I told you I'm going to dunk on you I

1001
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,400
told I mean do the Dutch really want

1002
00:35:49,318 --> 00:35:52,920
that like the Dutch like to be quiet but

1003
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,920
but here they like to be quiet and cool

1004
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,079
they don't necessarily want to be oh

1005
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,680
look at us look at us we're Dutch weed

1006
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:01,359
imagine just just take that's not really

1007
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:04,199
their Vibe imagine if you put as much

1008
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:06,598
