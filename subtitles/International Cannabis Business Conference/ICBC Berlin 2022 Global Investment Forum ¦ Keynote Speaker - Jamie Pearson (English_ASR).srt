1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,160
but yes i'm jamie pearson i'm the ceo of

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,919
bang

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,839
bang's 12 years old

4
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,798
we were born in a warehouse in oakland

5
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:15,759
12 years ago when cannabis was really

6
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:17,439
um

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,679
it was still medical

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,000
in california at that time and the

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,399
industry was just

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,839
coming into its own so think about 2012

11
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,879
where cannabis was

12
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:31,759
so 10 years later almost 13 it'll be 13

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:34,238
years next month

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,000
you know we've been around a long time

15
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,000
now we're in seven u.s states we're the

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,039
number one number two and number six

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,359
chocolate in canada for the first year

18
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,878
of cannabis 2.0 in canada we were the

19
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:48,479
number one sku

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,238
we outsold any skew of flour of pre-roll

21
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,159
in canada so

22
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:55,359
we've done very very well across the

23
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,718
world we have cbd that's in europe and

24
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,280
we've been in europe for about five

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,600
years um we're gonna skip the two

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,920
coveted years because that doesn't count

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,198
we all skip the two coveted years right

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,320
um

29
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:10,478
and what alex asked me to do was talk to

30
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,879
you guys about how cannabis is going to

31
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:15,280
impact the recession so i just want to

32
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:18,879
take a little bit of a show of hands how

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,879
many of you are german in this room

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,159
okay

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:28,400
and then how many americans do we have

36
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:30,880
oh okay five um and then i see i met a

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,920
bunch of people yesterday from thailand

38
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,239
yay

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,879
um and then just regular european

40
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,640
non-germans

41
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,920
okay so

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,200
i think i covered what what did i miss

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,200
israel israel what

44
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:51,118
australia welcome

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,118
new zealand

46
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,718
colombia south america awesome

47
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,399
what

48
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,158
uruguay oh

49
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,320
the country that started the whole

50
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,439
movement going

51
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:07,599
going legal uh federally legal welcome

52
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,199
so truly an international group not that

53
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,239
many people here yet but we are

54
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,479
expecting a couple hundred here um

55
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,878
what i'm talking about today is how

56
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,359
cannabis is going to impact

57
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:21,519
or could potentially impact

58
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,920
the recession that i think raise your

59
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,840
hand if you think we're in a recession

60
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,280
because i think europe and america are

61
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,520
pretty similar

62
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,759
so but so the americans are saying yes

63
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,480
the europeans not so much how is south

64
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,479
america doing

65
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,959
same i mean it's just turbulent times in

66
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,958
the economies uh because we're all

67
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,920
responding to what happened with kovid

68
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,360
um

69
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,639
so the question is are we in a recession

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,920
maybe

71
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,878
likely

72
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,280
um

73
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:53,840
no one's gonna argue that the economic

74
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,519
times are certain i think we're all in

75
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,479
agreement that we're in uncertain times

76
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,800
right now

77
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:01,518
i think cannabis can play an important

78
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,040
role i better silence my phone here

79
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,719
um

80
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:08,560
in riding the ship but the key here is

81
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,560
going to be that legislators are going

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,719
to need to get it right and i think what

83
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,120
we can all agree on is especially in the

84
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,199
u.s is legislators have not done a good

85
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,439
job of getting it right because i think

86
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,238
a lot of the legislation comes in

87
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,158
america based in fear

88
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,799
and what i'm really hoping is that in

89
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:29,120
other places where cannabis is coming

90
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,599
into its own and i got to give big kudos

91
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,080
to thailand you guys have done some

92
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:36,399
making cannabis legal and then giving

93
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,400
plants to people groundbreaking stuff

94
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,239
and that's really kind of grabbing the

95
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,039
industry and saying we're we're going to

96
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,519
embrace it i think we can do that in

97
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,798
europe i think the germans

98
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,680
personally

99
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,680
um

100
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,280
i have a special affinity for

101
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,280
deutschland

102
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,519
my kindese and here's disinviter

103
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,959
deutsche burger

104
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,200
deutsche pesa

105
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,200
um

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,879
so

107
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,638
i'm going to go back into english

108
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,639
um

109
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,560
i think that we can learn in germany and

110
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,319
you guys are getting ready to go wreck

111
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,680
you're going to go adult use here you

112
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,159
can learn from the mistakes that we made

113
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,079
in the u.s and i think if you get your

114
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,080
legislation right

115
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,959
you could actually impact the recession

116
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,079
and give yourself a new bucket of money

117
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,918
so in

118
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,639
the technically the definition of a

119
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:54,399
recession is if you have two quarters of

120
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,639
negative um economic growth so your gdp

121
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,478
goes backwards for two consecutive

122
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,160
quarters that's the technical definition

123
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,319
of a recession

124
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,919
in the u.s we're about

125
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,399
any day they're going to announce

126
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,599
quarter two results and we think that

127
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,198
they're going to show that it went

128
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,960
backwards and that means that quarter

129
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,360
one went backwards and quarter two went

130
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,918
backwards and we will technically be in

131
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,400
a recession here's the issue

132
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:22,000
the people who are charged with naming

133
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:23,599
the recession are called the nber

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
it is the

135
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,120
national bureau of economic research so

136
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,560
it's an eight-member panel non-partisan

137
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,038
they are the ones that say whether or

138
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,759
not it's been a recession

139
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:37,759
looks like for the first time in history

140
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,160
that eight member panel is going to say

141
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,160
we're not in a recession despite the

142
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,919
fact that we've gone backwards two

143
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,439
quarters in a row

144
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,038
and we've never seen that it's

145
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,959
unprecedented but the reason that is

146
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:51,038
probably going to happen

147
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,879
is because we have the lowest

148
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:57,120
unemployment in about 70 years

149
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,879
we're hovering right around 3.4 percent

150
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,680
in the us of unemployment so you've got

151
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:04,159
this strong job situation

152
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,639
but the economy is moving backwards

153
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,160
and then you couple that with inflation

154
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,038
that we haven't seen the likes of in

155
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,520
about 40 years and we haven't really

156
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,519
seen anything like this economically so

157
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,918
we can't just go back and learn from

158
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,959
history so what i'm going to do is take

159
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:20,079
you back

160
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,159
we're going to talk about what's

161
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,439
happened historically in recessions and

162
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,160
then we're going to talk about how

163
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,160
cannabis can play a role in that and i'd

164
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,160
like you to raise your hand how many of

165
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,160
you are cannabis entrepreneurs

166
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,159
how many of you are investors

167
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,600
okay so there's only a few investors so

168
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,279
i've geared this talk to investors but i

169
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,199
think what i'll do is just on the fly

170
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:49,439
shift over to the entrepreneurs um

171
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,759
okay so

172
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:54,879
are we in a recession maybe

173
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,400
likely but regardless uh we can use

174
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,959
cannabis to get ourselves out of it so

175
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,198
over here in germany the economy is are

176
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,279
also arguably in a recession in the

177
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,439
research that i did several prominent

178
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,638
economists said yeah we're probably in a

179
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:11,038
recession um regardless

180
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,240
we're all recovering from the pandemic's

181
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,598
impact on all of our economies right so

182
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,439
we also have

183
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:18,959
interesting things going on like the

184
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,839
climate crisis

185
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,758
and we have an alarming increase in

186
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,519
nationalistic politics we've got the

187
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,919
brexit and we've got the trumpers and

188
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,719
we've got all this weird politics going

189
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:31,120
on

190
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,280
and apologize if you're a trumper and

191
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,199
then um

192
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,799
you know what we basically have is a

193
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,478
financial crisis

194
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,800
sitting over a bunsen burner because

195
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:43,439
we've got all this other stuff happening

196
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,199
and at this moment in time

197
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,719
on top of all of that we have the war in

198
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,400
ukraine

199
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,919
and that is

200
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:54,318
arguably also impacting the supply chain

201
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,560
not just the pandemic but now the war in

202
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,039
ukraine is affecting wheat and it's

203
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,399
affecting gas and the i think the

204
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,079
biggest thing that people are talking

205
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,159
about is russian oil

206
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:06,399
and russian natural gas and there's a

207
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,919
big fear that russia is going to shut

208
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:12,478
off the natural gas supply to to germany

209
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,399
and if that happens the german economy

210
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,800
is going to be in trouble and that is

211
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:19,359
the one thing that everybody agrees upon

212
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,960
so i'm i'm not trying to scare all of

213
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,280
you but what i do want to do is kind of

214
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,198
give you a backdrop of

215
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,439
where the economic times are and how

216
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,400
cannabis is could potentially figure

217
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,959
into this

218
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,718
because what you basically have is

219
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:35,038
massive inflation

220
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,278
now inflation always impacts consumers

221
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:39,360
and consumer goods because people stop

222
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:40,399
spending money when things get expensive

223
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,399
right

224
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,480
so we have this massive inflation we

225
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,720
have a recession we have our economy

226
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,720
shrinking we've got a war going on we've

227
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,720
got a climate crisis and

228
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,879
things are uncertain and so we're

229
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,959
sitting here saying how do we as an

230
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,360
industry impact all of that in a

231
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,039
positive way and i think we can do that

232
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,919
and so investors have a right to be

233
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:04,799
worried and then here's the last thing

234
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,240
uh bang is a public company so

235
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,278
you know i watched the markets pretty

236
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,159
closely and we are what's in considered

237
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:15,600
a trough bear market so raise your hand

238
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:19,039
if you know what a trough bear market is

239
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,440
okay so a bear market's when

240
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,360
you've got a 20 shrinkage of price

241
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,240
across the board doesn't matter if it's

242
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,680
uh what sector so if it's across all

243
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,320
sectors you've gone from bowl to bear

244
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,719
a trough bear is when it's more than 35

245
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,440
percent and it's more than two quarters

246
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,240
in a row we've been more than 35 percent

247
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,480
across all sectors for many many many

248
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,159
quarters so we are

249
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,320
it's unprecedented what's happening in

250
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,879
the capital markets it basically means

251
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,879
liquidity has dried up

252
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,559
so we can all agree it's really hard to

253
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,240
get money when you're in cannabis it's

254
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,719
hard to get money anyway

255
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,000
so if you're in cannabis trying to get

256
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,839
money and you're trying to get money in

257
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,600
a trough bear market and then you have

258
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,959
all of that backdrop that i just laid

259
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,040
out for you

260
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:07,919
the question is how do cannabis

261
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:10,159
entrepreneurs build an industry

262
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,078
in the middle of all of that

263
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:15,519
and i think one of the things is we have

264
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:17,759
to talk to our legislators about what's

265
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,839
actually happening

266
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,519
the other thing is if you're an investor

267
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,279
and you're liquid

268
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,120
there is this is where

269
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,360
fortunes are going to be made because

270
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,320
there is a lot of opportunity out in the

271
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,000
world

272
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,720
you can buy pretty much across the

273
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,639
sector 35 back of

274
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,278
normal pricing so

275
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,078
liquid people are gonna go get richer

276
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:39,120
and

277
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,278
uh

278
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,480
the really good news for cannabis

279
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:44,720
investors and this is where the

280
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,440
entrepreneurs need to perk up

281
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,160
is that our entire industry is not going

282
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,680
to function across normal market sectors

283
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:52,879
we're going to function like alcohol and

284
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,519
tobacco

285
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:58,559
and alcohol and tobacco in tough

286
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,159
economic times actually have an increase

287
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,000
in demand makes sense we're all

288
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,838
depressed we want to get drunk

289
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,240
right but the difference is now we're in

290
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,640
this massive inflationary environment

291
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,639
and we can't afford top shelf liquor so

292
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,600
what do consumers do

293
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,759
they go get the cheaper alternative

294
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,040
here's where the rub is if you're in

295
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,360
cannabis

296
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,599
what's the cheaper alternative to legal

297
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,639
cannabis

298
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,120
illegal cannabis so it actually is going

299
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,278
to serve if legislators don't get this

300
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,399
right it's going to blow up the illicit

301
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,559
market

302
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,240
because people are crunched they're not

303
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,159
going to stop buying cannabis they're

304
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,079
going to buy more cannabis but if they

305
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,480
want to buy more cannabis they've got to

306
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:42,719
buy it at cheaper prices so if your

307
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,039
legislators over tax it

308
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,399
if they over test it if they do all of

309
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,399
these things that we've seen in

310
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,278
california i'll give an example

311
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:54,799
bang was born in california

312
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:57,278
in california they test the plant before

313
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,799
it goes to be blasted into oil then they

314
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,039
test the oil

315
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,559
then you need another test when it goes

316
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:03,919
to the distributor

317
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:05,838
then when it goes from the distributor

318
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,958
to the manufacturer you need another

319
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,000
test

320
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,359
and then when you get it from the

321
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,600
manufacturer and you put it in the

322
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,600
product you need another test before it

323
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,839
goes to the retail market the same

324
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,320
cannabis is tested four times

325
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,079
each one of those tests costs anywhere

326
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,560
from eight hundred to fifteen hundred

327
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:24,479
dollars so if i'm going to put

328
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:27,199
five thousand skus into the market it's

329
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,920
going to add whatever that math is to my

330
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,839
sales price at each juncture so it

331
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:33,919
continues to increase the price increase

332
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,959
the price increase the price

333
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:39,838
it's also taxed at all of those levels

334
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:42,000
so now i make a chocolate bar that costs

335
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,360
anywhere from two to three dollars to

336
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,879
manufacture

337
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,680
guess what the retail price of my

338
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,600
chocolate bar is in california

339
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,078
20 bucks

340
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,600
and about 80 percent of that goes to

341
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,239
taxes

342
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,560
so there's no profit being made because

343
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,680
the government has their hand out at

344
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,199
every level of that process

345
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,120
what we're trying to get done in new

346
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,879
york is we're trying to get new york to

347
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,000
understand look you've already invented

348
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:09,838
the wheel

349
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
you've got bodegas on every corner that

350
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,760
sell alcohol and tobacco

351
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,360
you already have distribution you

352
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,519
already know

353
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,320
how to give these people permits so you

354
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,679
can make money on the permit of 200 000

355
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,560
bodegas

356
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,319
and then you can limit how much they can

357
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:27,599
sell but you can let them sell at the

358
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,440
corner store

359
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,720
so the woman in curlers doesn't call her

360
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,639
plug

361
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,399
she goes to the corner store and buys

362
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,879
legal clean

363
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,759
tested cannabis so if you open the

364
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:42,320
barrier of entry and you allow

365
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:44,559
all the citizens to access

366
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,519
safe clean cannabis and you don't tax it

367
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,119
to death

368
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,759
think about how much money they'll make

369
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,679
in new york by giving everybody access

370
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,759
to it because guess what

371
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:56,559
everybody already has access to it new

372
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,159
york it is the largest nascent cannabis

373
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,879
market in the world

374
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:02,958
the the statistics are 200 metric tons

375
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,559
of cannabis are sold on the island of

376
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,958
manhattan every year

377
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,479
and i did not make that number up

378
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,719
it's a little bit of a low estimate i've

379
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,320
heard it much higher

380
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,759
i've heard the lower estimate is 40

381
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,040
metric tons of cannabis well guess where

382
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,399
all that comes from comes from

383
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,719
california

384
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,078
and that's the californians selling it

385
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,920
out the back door because it's the only

386
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:24,000
way they can keep themselves in business

387
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:26,879
we can learn from that here

388
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,320
so what we need to do is really urge the

389
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:32,720
legislators to do a few things so i made

390
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,720
a list

391
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:40,159
the list is

392
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,159
number one

393
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,639
i'm going to go back here and talk about

394
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,958
the recession again because i know we

395
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,519
all love that

396
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,679
reasonable tax rates so

397
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,799
they should take their money in volume

398
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,958
rather than having a few people

399
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,838
allowed to do cannabis and then taxing

400
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,879
them to death and if you tax it too much

401
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,040
you're going to drive people to the

402
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:05,360
illicit market they should have lots of

403
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:07,679
retail access points

404
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,079
if you give them lots of retail access

405
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:14,000
points they have no reason to go to the

406
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:16,799
nascent market reasonable and achievable

407
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,440
barrier of entry meaning if you are a

408
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,120
legacy cannabis person you've admittedly

409
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,920
been breaking the law for all of these

410
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,000
years so in the industry i call them the

411
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:28,000
roots in the suits so we're sitting here

412
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
with all the suits the roots of the

413
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,440
people that made sure cannabis was

414
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,759
available when our laws did not allow

415
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,440
cannabis to be available on the open

416
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,440
you know openly

417
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,040
we need to embrace the roots we need to

418
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,040
let those people into the market we need

419
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,120
to lower the barrier of entry for them

420
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:48,078
to get into the market because the the

421
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,000
suits have a lot to learn from the roots

422
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,000
and if we do that we're not going to

423
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,919
drive people to the illicit market

424
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,720
because what we're going to do is bring

425
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:59,039
the illicit market into the legal market

426
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,639
which means we're going to invite all of

427
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,480
the people who know everything about

428
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,839
growing we're going to grow better

429
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,440
cannabis we're going to provide better

430
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,360
cannabis and we're going to have all of

431
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,839
those lessons that they've learned over

432
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,079
the last 20 years and we're going to

433
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,920
elevate the entire industry by bringing

434
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:16,078
the roots in

435
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,439
a lot of the suits will say to me yeah

436
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,838
and they need us because we're going to

437
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,000
teach them how to do kpis and we're

438
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,360
going to teach them how to do business

439
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,440
i'm going to tell you

440
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,879
if you've been running a business

441
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,240
in an era

442
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,759
that's illegal

443
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,560
and you've been able to skirt all of

444
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,079
those laws you're still growing you're

445
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,159
still packaging you're still

446
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:37,599
manufacturing and you're still selling

447
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:39,919
at a retail level

448
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,839
they have more to teach us about running

449
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:44,559
a business than we probably have to

450
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,199
teach them probably what we need to do

451
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:49,198
is really embrace the roots at a core

452
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:50,958
level and then we can just teach them

453
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,799
our vernacular they need to learn about

454
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:55,198
15 vocabulary words and then we're all

455
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:57,758
going to be on the same playing field

456
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,838
um so we bring those um we bring the

457
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,079
roots into the game and then the next

458
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,480
thing we need to do is have strong

459
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:08,000
social equity programs and that's

460
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,078
because the war on drugs in the us

461
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,359
and i've read in europe has been a war

462
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,078
on race

463
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,599
it is not about squashing drugs

464
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:16,558
governments know that everyone's using

465
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,078
drugs

466
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:21,838
what cannabis the cannabis war on drugs

467
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,000
has been is putting black and brown

468
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,519
people in prison and what we need to do

469
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,679
is get all the black and brown people

470
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:30,160
out of prison and we need to give them

471
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,600
entry into this legal market and when we

472
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,320
do that

473
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:38,000
as an industry we reduce the amount of

474
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:40,000
people that go into the illicit market

475
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,240
and then we also reduce the number of

476
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,400
taxes that we pay keeping people in

477
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,200
prison

478
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,480
here's a big one governments need to

479
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,919
allow cannabis in all its forms

480
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,480
people want edibles they want beverages

481
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,559
they want concentrates they want all of

482
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,720
these products and what governments do

483
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,798
is they go oh we're scared we think

484
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,000
we're only gonna let you have flour

485
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:05,759
and then people want edibles they're

486
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,880
gonna go get edibles in the illicit

487
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,119
market

488
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,160
what the government needs to do is

489
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,519
accept that cannabis is here that people

490
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,440
are using it

491
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,240
and they need to let us have it in all

492
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,480
of its forms and when we do that we

493
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,960
actually then increase

494
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,120
the legal market

495
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,919
the ability to tax the legal market the

496
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:30,479
bucket of money gets bigger and this is

497
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,200
a way to combat the recession because

498
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,360
it's the first time in my lifetime that

499
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,038
there's a new bucket of money

500
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:39,678
so think about it we've always played

501
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:41,359
monopoly with taxes oh we're gonna give

502
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,600
it to the military and they're like no

503
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:45,599
no i'm a democrat i'm going to give it

504
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:47,439
to education it's the same dollar we're

505
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:48,639
just moving it around on the on the

506
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,600
playing field

507
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,240
but if what we do is go get a new dollar

508
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:57,519
from the illicit market we actually now

509
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,519
can increase our economy by the impact

510
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,918
that cannabis will have on it what we

511
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:02,798
need to do is accept that cannabis is

512
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,160
here

513
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,000
it's legal

514
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,880
and we need to give the people who want

515
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,960
it access to it in all of its forms and

516
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,000
the last thing that i think governments

517
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,360
need to do

518
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,319
hope you're all taking notes and that

519
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:16,558
you're going to go talk to your

520
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,639
legislators because this is what really

521
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:20,399
needs to happen i've been doing this for

522
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,240
12 years

523
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,960
i've watched

524
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,079
countries states legislators get it

525
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,319
wrong

526
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,079
and then we always end up back at the

527
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:31,678
same spot

528
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,678
i watched california do you know that we

529
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,160
have the biggest illicit market in the

530
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,200
united states in california

531
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:42,160
there were three 000 legal dispensaries

532
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,759
on 1231 2017.

533
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:48,640
and california went wreck on 1-1 2018

534
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:51,599
and there were 300 legal dispensaries

535
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,600
the next day but guess what there were

536
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,599
2700

537
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:58,400
illicit shops because none of them

538
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,640
closed

539
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,038
so then what happens is the consumer has

540
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,400
no idea that they're buying from an

541
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:05,359
illegal store

542
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,759
and

543
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:10,879
those dollars are not going into the tax

544
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:13,599
bucket they're going into now somebody's

545
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,640
hands who does not have to lab test and

546
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:18,319
who does not have to pay taxes

547
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,240
so the last thing that governments need

548
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:25,439
to do is stop doing milligram limits

549
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,759
they think they're somehow protecting us

550
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,000
so all of a sudden in california you

551
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:33,440
could buy a thousand milligram chocolate

552
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,240
bar or cookie or concentrate and the

553
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,400
next day after cannabis was made

554
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,159
legal recreationally you could only buy

555
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,000
a hundred milligrams

556
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,360
well guess what everyone did

557
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,440
they kept buying their thousand

558
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:47,199
milligram cookie they just bought it in

559
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,038
the illegal market so these are the

560
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,519
lessons that we can learn and if you do

561
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:52,319
these things if if germany gets this

562
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,240
right

563
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:57,200
and if they allow home grow and they

564
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,000
allow consumption lounges and they allow

565
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,558
high milligrams and they allow cannabis

566
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,519
in all of its forms and they embrace

567
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:07,200
social equity and they lower the barrier

568
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,119
of entry and they let

569
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,600
let you go by cannabis and aldi you can

570
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,798
go buy liquor and aldi if they do those

571
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:14,558
things they're going to have a bigger

572
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:16,480
bucket of money

573
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:18,158
to help their economy

574
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,159
they're going to be able to control the

575
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,679
cannabis market because they're going to

576
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,679
they're going to actually have access at

577
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,919
the point of sale of the data they're

578
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,120
going to know who's buying it how much

579
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,640
they're buying

580
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,798
but when it's in the illicit market we

581
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,600
have no idea what's happening

582
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:35,440
right and then you allow a free market

583
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,599
economy to function the way it's

584
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,320
supposed to because people who are doing

585
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:42,079
good business stay in business and

586
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,038
people who are not doing good business

587
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:47,599
don't make it and that is the hallmark

588
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:49,200
of a free market business economy

589
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,558
let them do business

590
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,919
and let them fail if they're going to

591
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:53,918
fail and let them succeed if they're

592
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,679
going to succeed but when you legislate

593
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,240
them to death

594
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:01,919
everything becomes fake

595
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,599
so what happens now is

596
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,240
we're in this recession we've got this

597
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,439
high inflation we have an opportunity in

598
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,880
germany

599
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,320
and it's really exciting you guys are

600
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,600
going to get your rules

601
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:13,599
any day

602
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,519
and what everyone's what i'm reading is

603
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:19,678
everyone's predicting that it's going to

604
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:21,440
go wreck on 1 1 20 23 and then it'll

605
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,600
take a year for them to get their rules

606
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,840
correct and the first legal cannabis

607
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:28,558
will be sold probably in sometime in

608
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:30,720
2024 so it's going to take a couple of

609
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:33,359
years for all of that to get going but

610
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,319
it's groups like this that can speak to

611
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:38,719
their legislatures and say go learn from

612
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:41,119
colorado go learn from washington go

613
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,240
learn from massachusetts

614
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:46,079
and that brings me to the next point

615
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,319
germany is what i consider an emerging

616
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:49,678
market right now you've got medical

617
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,319
you don't have wreck

618
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,798
and what we're learning in the us is

619
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:59,119
that the really really advanced markets

620
00:22:54,798 --> 00:23:02,480
the colorado the oregon

621
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:03,839
california alaska bless you

622
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,120
these

623
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:07,199
markets

624
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,759
are in a race to the bottom

625
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,679
so cannabis is selling for less money

626
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:14,319
and it's really hard for operators to

627
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,480
make money but the markets have limited

628
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,079
licenses and that are new

629
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,440
are the ones where there's limited

630
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:20,720
competition

631
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,798
and

632
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,519
those people have an opportunity to make

633
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:27,918
money so you're in a situation right now

634
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:29,440
where germany is technically an emerging

635
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,440
market

636
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,558
you have an opportunity to limit the

637
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,640
number of licenses which i'm a proponent

638
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:39,038
of having lots and lots of retail

639
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,799
licenses and then having your bottleneck

640
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:42,319
at the manufacturing because that's

641
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:44,158
where you can control quality that's

642
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:45,839
where you can control safety but once

643
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,559
you know you've got clean safe legal

644
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,798
cannabis sell it to the masses

645
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:53,678
so you limit the licenses at that

646
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:55,759
manufacturing level and you also allow

647
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,080
as many distributors to exist as

648
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:00,480
possible so you get it to the people

649
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:01,918
because people are getting it anyway

650
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,960
so what i want to do is talk to you

651
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,360
about

652
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,798
what would happen if the if we are in a

653
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:11,038
recession how long is it going to last

654
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:13,440
okay i'm going to take a poll

655
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:16,158
how many of you think that this economic

656
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,880
downturn is going to last longer than

657
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,440
two years

658
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,440
one year

659
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,120
less than one year

660
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,558
a few of you okay the majority of you

661
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,599
think it's going to last more than one

662
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:32,879
year the average i i did that i looked

663
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:34,000
at the last

664
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,480
um

665
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,558
five bear markets starting in 2001

666
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,480
the amount that the market decreased was

667
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:45,519
37 percent

668
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:49,360
and it was 546 days

669
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:52,319
2002 278 days 34

670
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:54,719
2008 408 days

671
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:58,879
52

672
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:04,240
2009 62 days that was coven uh 27

673
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:08,000
percent and 2020 33 days 34

674
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,599
the average bear market lasts 265 days

675
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,839
so less than a year

676
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,439
so let's say that the recession starts

677
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,278
july 1st

678
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,278
it means that it'll be over sometime in

679
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:19,200
march of 2023

680
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:20,720
i don't i don't think that's my

681
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,558
prediction is that that's not what's

682
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,960
going to happen because of all of those

683
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,038
things that i've told you about the

684
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:31,600
warren ukraine

685
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:33,919
supply chain the gas situation in europe

686
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:35,759
but what i'm saying to you is if you

687
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:39,200
have some liquidity if you are an

688
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:41,440
investor cannabis is a great way to

689
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,880
hedge inflation it's a great way to

690
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,400
diversify

691
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,360
your holdings

692
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,600
it's recession resistant because it is

693
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:52,319
going to go up in demand

694
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:54,879
and so you've got an excellent position

695
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:57,839
in germany get your legislators minds

696
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,679
right stop them from being fearful we

697
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,720
all see that the emperor awareness wears

698
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,880
no clothes

699
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,000
we've got to get our legislators to see

700
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,480
that as well

701
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,038
and if we can get the entire

702
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,759
cannabis community to understand this is

703
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:13,599
what we're facing we can be the ones

704
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,839
this industry can be the ones that

705
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,918
single-handedly help governments beat

706
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:20,240
this recession

707
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,240
