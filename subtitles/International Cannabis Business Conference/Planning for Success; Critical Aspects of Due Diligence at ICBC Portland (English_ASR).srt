1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:15,219
this was very exciting we don't always

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:18,070
this is often up and overlooked and

3
00:00:15,218 --> 00:00:22,269
overlooked facets of the cannabis

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:23,800
industry due diligence is very important

5
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:25,689
you have to do your research you have to

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,868

20
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,729
good morning thank you for your

21
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:25,949
attention or for joining us today so I

22
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:27,900
know people sort of their eyes can glaze

23
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,750
over when you talk about due diligence

24
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,820
and compliance they're like oh no not

25
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,649
more of those things we have to do but

26
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:36,629
I'd like to and I think my panelists

27
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:38,310
will join me in saying that it has a

28
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,728
different you can look at it a different

29
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,579
way

30
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:44,368
ie to protect your bottom line to make

31
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:47,789
your business stronger to make it more

32
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:49,890
viable and also in the future if you do

33
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:52,079
want to you know when it becomes legal

34
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,450
federally if you want to cash in on that

35
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,939
these are the things you have to do but

36
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,700
you you have to do it just now just to

37
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,368
make your business survive what you know

38
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,020
just stand out from all the rest as I

39
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:07,228
always say to people as my I have an

40
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:09,538
investigative background if if somebody

41
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:12,229
else business is is softer they're

42
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:14,219
cutting corners places that's where the

43
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:16,919
regulator's the authorities are going to

44
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:19,469
go and the bad guys as well to

45
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,268
infiltrate because it's easier if you've

46
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:23,489
crossed all your t's dotted all your

47
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:25,620
eyes you're a much safer much healthier

48
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:27,569
business and that's what we're here to

49
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,459
talk to about today which is the

50
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:33,870
financial operational regulatory and

51
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:36,959
reputational risk that you need to guard

52
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,670
against and it's not it doesn't have to

53
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,579
be heavy lifting or really really

54
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:44,219
expensive I do this for clients I do due

55
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:46,049
diligence backgrounds on the clients to

56
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:48,719
give to investors or vice versa

57
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:50,730
we I've done anti-money laundering

58
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,919
reviews for financial institutions that

59
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:54,298
want to bank my cannabis money thank

60
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,729
goodness they're willing to begin to

61
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:59,310
talk about it done it for armored car

62
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:01,078
companies that want a bank so there is

63
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,789
interest out there but you've got to do

64
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:03,959
it the right way and I think we've

65
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:06,900
brought together a pretty interesting

66
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,680
panel that covers the entirety of those

67
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,900
risks we start with Barnard next to me

68
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,510
Barnard is from immerged law group here

69
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,789
in Portland and they're the very first

70
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:20,849
law group to get into the business and

71
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:23,039
have deep experience in a variety of

72
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:25,560
issues that you face from land use to

73
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,620
corporate structures to tax to

74
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,539
employment to HR and probably things

75
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,840
I've forgotten

76
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:34,938
Barnard will tell you about and next to

77
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,390
Barnard is my colleague Lincoln Eckhart

78
00:03:34,938 --> 00:03:39,799
who is evaluations an appraisal expert

79
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:42,469
and one of the things I like about

80
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:44,930
Lincoln is he's also a native to

81
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:47,269
Portland but I very early on we started

82
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,409
doing cannabis services at fti which is

83
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:51,799
a little unusual because we are a

84
00:03:48,408 --> 00:03:53,840
publicly traded company we called up

85
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,849
Lincoln and said can you value a

86
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,530
cannabis company even though it's kind

87
00:03:55,848 --> 00:03:59,738
of a start-up and they don't have a lot

88
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:03,318
of formal processes and procedures and

89
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:05,810
maybe their books are in crayon I don't

90
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:09,229
know or on maybe a Excel spreadsheet

91
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:10,400
because I'm sure done it before so these

92
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:12,738
are the kind of people that you need to

93
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,950
we what we want to do today is give you

94
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:19,069
some concrete takeaways and the last

95
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:22,099
panelist member Matt Murphy is a

96
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:26,269
vice-president from chiron life sciences

97
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:28,370
and Matt brings two unique attributes to

98
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:31,099
our panel today one he's actually

99
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,740
running a cannabis company that's based

100
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:37,160
in Canada but doing work in Colombia as

101
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,769
in Bogota Colombia and to Matt as a

102
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,120
retired DEA agent who was on the

103
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:43,038
diversion side I worked in

104
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,399
pharmaceuticals for more than 25 years

105
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:51,259
and I think particularly helpful to have

106
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:53,029
Matt today after the DEA move CBD from

107
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:54,829
schedule 1 to schedule 5 the other day

108
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:57,978
so I think hopefully he can provide some

109
00:04:54,829 --> 00:05:00,168
unique insight into how that happened so

110
00:04:57,978 --> 00:05:02,750
let's start with you Bernard what are

111
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:06,079
some concrete things that companies need

112
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,180
to do in terms of being in compliance

113
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,889
with the law but then aren't aren't

114
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,220
going to just sink the ship at the very

115
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:14,960
beginning by getting if you might say

116
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:19,520
expensive legal advice but that helps

117
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:24,459
them grow and prosper sure thank you

118
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:29,120
so that expensive legal advice is tough

119
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:35,000
a tough target to hit sometimes but in

120
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:37,158
terms of in terms of being able to cover

121
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,490
your bases on the front end without

122
00:05:37,158 --> 00:05:44,269
sinking the ship as Elaine says

123
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:50,060
I the I think the kind of the most

124
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:54,978
productive and and and the the most

125
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:57,379
productive approach is to is to identify

126
00:05:54,978 --> 00:06:00,728
the categories of issues that you're

127
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:06,709
dealing with so it emerged there's

128
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:09,228
emerged lagu the firm I am with there

129
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:14,388
are a number of corporate lawyers with

130
00:06:09,228 --> 00:06:15,769
deep securities law background and so if

131
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:17,060
you're starting a company and you're

132
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:20,299
looking at raising money from outside

133
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,579
investors it makes sense to be meeting

134
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,280
with someone like that even if you're

135
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:27,978
not yet ready to you know form a

136
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,579
corporation or what have you and that

137
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:35,089
way you're getting off on the right foot

138
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:38,598
another area that that matters is

139
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:40,908
obviously the licensing end and right

140
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:44,779
now in in the licensing environment in

141
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:46,399
Oregon you're often talking about going

142
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:51,288
through a process that can take many

143
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:52,899
months and in there are there there

144
00:06:51,288 --> 00:06:55,519
might be twists and turns along the way

145
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:59,929
as the industry and the regulatory

146
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:02,029
environment continues to develop and and

147
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:05,718
and you're not going to want to lose

148
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:07,819
time because you kind of went down maybe

149
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:14,120
went down what seems to be a wrong track

150
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:20,468
in retrospect there are there are also a

151
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:23,889
number of areas that that at least a a

152
00:07:20,468 --> 00:07:28,218
cannabis business person that is

153
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:31,810
relatively new to what we used to call

154
00:07:28,218 --> 00:07:34,668
kind of above ground business practices

155
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:37,038
it can make a lot of sense to be meeting

156
00:07:34,668 --> 00:07:39,829
with meeting with an employment lawyer

157
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:42,110
to figure out what steps you need to

158
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:45,709
take now so that you're not dealing with

159
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:48,830
a potentially expensive problem maybe

160
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:54,168
just a few months down the road

161
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:57,348
and and then and and then of course

162
00:07:54,168 --> 00:08:01,128
their land use and and and local code

163
00:07:57,348 --> 00:08:05,000
and zoning issues and and then there's

164
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:08,539
there's my area which which is tax

165
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,810
issues and and that's an area where I

166
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:13,430
guess tax professionals often kind of

167
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:17,598
privately gripe about always being

168
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:19,550
brought in to transactions late the

169
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,139
reason for that is oftentimes you're

170
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,978
brought into a transaction and then you

171
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:28,519
kind of have a if an only if moment you

172
00:08:24,978 --> 00:08:29,959
know only if the you know we had been

173
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:32,740
having this conversation three months or

174
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:37,429
six months ago you know we could be

175
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:42,139
talking about a much a much smaller tax

176
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:43,699
bill but in terms of the discussion

177
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:45,799
you'd be having with a tax person on the

178
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,720
front end you'd be talking about well

179
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:50,028
what sort of business entity are we

180
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,570
going to use are we going to be using

181
00:08:50,028 --> 00:08:55,189
more than one business entity when we're

182
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,990
when we're trying to pencil out our

183
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:01,010
financials

184
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:03,049
what is this tax code section 280a issue

185
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:10,100
and how does that really work

186
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:11,809
and then and and you might you might end

187
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,420
up setting up a very small business that

188
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:17,269
you know in your context make sense from

189
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:20,539
a tax perspective or you might be

190
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:24,379
setting up a multi entity structure with

191
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:28,899
kind of specific with specific goals in

192
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:33,588
mind you know maybe maybe protecting

193
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:36,549
risk-averse investors from potentially

194
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:38,329
adverse or expensive tax consequences

195
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:42,338
flowing through to their personal

196
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:46,039
returns or you might be you might be

197
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:47,990
looking at ways to allow your business

198
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:52,789
to have access to the kind of expertise

199
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:55,820
it needs without the compensation you're

200
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:57,139
paying those people being non deductible

201
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,070
because of 280e

202
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:02,779
or you might be looking at ways to

203
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,640
ensure that you know when you

204
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:08,539
when you renew your lease for example

205
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:12,409
that you don't you don't end up losing

206
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:15,789
you know a $300,000 tax deduction just

207
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:20,329
because you didn't plan ahead in how you

208
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:24,349
set up your lease so if if you're

209
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:29,150
sitting down with with with an attorney

210
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:32,149
or different specialist attorneys as you

211
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:34,699
kind of learn the lay of the land if

212
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:36,620
you're sitting down with them on a kind

213
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,180
of a brainstorming a planning level and

214
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:41,299
then you get together with your team

215
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:43,969
after you've I guess educated yourself

216
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:46,759
somewhat in that environment then I

217
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:53,960
think you're you're going to find that

218
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:57,080
not only our taxes much it'll be a much

219
00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:00,080
less expensive proposition but you're

220
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:03,200
also going to be able to manage those

221
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,090
taxes in real time and not get behind

222
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,280
the ball and then getting to the due

223
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:09,879
diligence portion of things you're not

224
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:13,669
going to be having a potentially awkward

225
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:16,279
conversation with an investor who or a

226
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:20,659
potential buyer down the road who comes

227
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:23,209
from a world where tax compliance is is

228
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:26,838
is is taking for granted and is just

229
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:29,180
expected and who might start to wonder

230
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:32,060
what other problems you have simply

231
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:36,379
because you have some unaddressed tax

232
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:39,259
issues thanks Bernard Lincoln you we've

233
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:41,088
seen all these mega valuations coming

234
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:43,549
out of Canada that could make anybody's

235
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:46,640
eyes get stuck with dollar signs in them

236
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:48,879
because it just looks so wonderful and

237
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,049
but at the same time maybe fantastical

238
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:54,259
one of the things you'd said to me is

239
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:56,449
value is all about pricing risk can you

240
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:58,250
explain what you mean about that and

241
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:02,500
what you see it what you think about

242
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:04,700
these sort of if you will sky high

243
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:09,409
valuations going around and is that

244
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:11,570
going to stay there forever I think it's

245
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:12,769
important to bifurcate the the public

246
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,929
market from the

247
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:18,049
ivenn market I think in Canada you have

248
00:12:14,928 --> 00:12:20,389
seen some sky-high evaluations applied

249
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:22,039
to cannabis businesses I think there's a

250
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:23,568
couple of reasons for that one its

251
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:26,480
Canada it's a different regulatory

252
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:27,948
structure obviously to the companies

253
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,539
gone public when a company goes public

254
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:33,378
it's really bendy wrist

255
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:34,969
oh by a large magnitude and there's also

256
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:37,369
a lot of hot money that's moving into

257
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:39,499
that sector so it's it's not a typical

258
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:41,480
to see you know some of these cannabis

259
00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:43,970
companies of Canada publicly traded they

260
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,730
were trading at 100 200 400 times

261
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:48,110
revenue when you come back to the

262
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,329
private sector you look at what's

263
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:52,909
happening in transactions in the private

264
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:55,789
sector you see much more pedestrian

265
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:57,708
multiples I'd say there's a recent

266
00:12:55,789 --> 00:13:01,759
transaction in Washington State of six

267
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:04,729
large retail operations is sold at one

268
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:07,548
times revenue or point seven times next

269
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:10,489
12 months revenue it's a far cry from a

270
00:13:07,548 --> 00:13:12,860
four hundred times revenue I think a big

271
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:14,528
part of that is really what what I want

272
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,769
to hit on in terms of the due diligence

273
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:20,869
considerations which is valuation

274
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:23,419
essentially is a pricing risk exercise I

275
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:26,778
mean your bet you're basically pricing

276
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:30,438
risk value equals the present value of

277
00:13:26,778 --> 00:13:31,789
future expected cash flows not the

278
00:13:30,438 --> 00:13:33,708
sexiest thing in the world but that's

279
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:35,778
that's how you value a business or any

280
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:37,818
asset you look at you know what are the

281
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:40,278
expected future cash flows and you

282
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:43,338
present value those cash flows back to

283
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:45,948
present you know to today that present

284
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:48,499
valuing exercise is that you use a risk

285
00:13:45,948 --> 00:13:50,389
adjusted discount rate so you've kind of

286
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:52,730
build up a discount rate based on the

287
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:56,839
risk that you see in the asset or in the

288
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:58,159
business with cannabis companies you

289
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:00,679
know one of the challenges are there's

290
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:03,230
already sort of systemic risk that are

291
00:14:00,678 --> 00:14:04,668
there essentially because of the

292
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,069
regulatory environment because the

293
00:14:04,668 --> 00:14:09,438
public perception because of other

294
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:12,048
factors you already have a risk premium

295
00:14:09,438 --> 00:14:14,328
built-in when looking at cannabis

296
00:14:12,048 --> 00:14:16,970
companies I think to the benefit of

297
00:14:14,328 --> 00:14:18,818
owners anyone is in you know operating a

298
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,709
business and in the cannabis industry

299
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:24,139
the most critical thing you can do is

300
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:26,069
try to de-risk when you're thinking

301
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:28,110
about potential exit down the

302
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:31,230
trying to raise capital from outside

303
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:34,139
investors whatever you can do to de-risk

304
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:36,120
the enterprise it's a direct correlation

305
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:39,120
between de-risking an enterprise and

306
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:43,590
increasing the value they're inversely

307
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:46,879
related right so if you have systems in

308
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:50,700
place processes in place if you have

309
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:53,580
money mad cash management systems seed

310
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:56,759
to sale systems in place you have

311
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:58,500
contracts with your suppliers with your

312
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:59,759
wholesalers or retailers whatever aspect

313
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,129
of the industry you're in

314
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,350
if those contracts have been you know

315
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:06,870
vetted by lawyers are written by lawyers

316
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:08,550
and they've been validated your

317
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:10,590
financial systems your accounting

318
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:14,039
systems all these things that sometimes

319
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:15,509
seem sort of mundane and not of great

320
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,519
entry especially trying to build a

321
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:19,289
business you're focused on your

322
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,610
customers you're focused on your product

323
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:23,009
or whatever is the service that you're

324
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:25,440
providing you're not necessarily too

325
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:27,990
concerned or thinking about the more

326
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,700
mundane aspects of the business well

327
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:32,310
when you go to a point of trying to

328
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,720
raise capital or get a value assigned to

329
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:36,629
this asset that you're building that

330
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,940
your that you that you own it's all

331
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:40,649
about it's all about you know that that

332
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,620
de-risking process that an outside

333
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:46,289
investor can come in and look at your

334
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,929
business and say okay you know

335
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:51,779
everything checks out I don't see any

336
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:55,169
red flags here though that that process

337
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:59,069
and that creating that system in place

338
00:15:55,169 --> 00:16:00,899
that enterprise will directly pay off in

339
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,790
terms of increased value as Elaine said

340
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:04,980
she first are talking about valuing

341
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:06,209
cannabis companies and she had a you

342
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,620
know said of client what happens they

343
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:09,990
just have some spreadsheets and all

344
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,820
their financials are basically just a

345
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:15,060
couple of Excel data sheets and that's

346
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:17,220
all they we really have as documents to

347
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:19,469
look at with his business yeah you can

348
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,269
certainly value it but the risk premium

349
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,769
you're gonna apply when you vet when

350
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:23,970
you're present valuing those cash flows

351
00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:27,299
or whether you're using a market

352
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:31,070
multiple is directly correlated to the

353
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:33,629
to the quality of the information

354
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:36,360
another really important point is people

355
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:37,889
I mean you can have great financials at

356
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,209
least you know financial statements you

357
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:41,879
can have these systems in place

358
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:43,919
you can have these checks and balances

359
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:47,339
built into your operations to make sure

360
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:49,078
that your you've minimized risk but

361
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,819
really what would an appraiser or what

362
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:53,248
an investor is going to look at is a

363
00:16:50,818 --> 00:16:55,019
quality of management I don't care what

364
00:16:53,249 --> 00:16:57,119
industry you're in that's probably the

365
00:16:55,019 --> 00:17:00,600
single most important thing so as you

366
00:16:57,119 --> 00:17:02,670
look to build or expand or partner with

367
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,230
other companies or you're bringing

368
00:17:02,669 --> 00:17:07,048
outside people to help build your

369
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:09,179
business just as Elaine alluded to

370
00:17:07,048 --> 00:17:10,918
earlier something that she does is does

371
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:12,720
due diligence on people do deal with due

372
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:14,819
diligence on your suppliers your

373
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,689
wholesalers whoever you're you know in

374
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:20,369
your in your chain of operations just

375
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:21,659
make sure you put forth the effort to

376
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:23,879
really research who it is that you're

377
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:25,079
working with because that's something

378
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,649
that's gonna be very important to a

379
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:31,759
potential investor and as I said you

380
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:36,389
know everything you can do to to have a

381
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:40,288
a low-risk well-documented well

382
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:41,880
insulated infrastructure will move you

383
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:43,319
when you go to raise capital or sell

384
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,390
because it's gonna have a direct impact

385
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:46,829
on what you know what you basic and

386
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:50,669
achieve in the marketplace for your

387
00:17:46,829 --> 00:17:53,699
asset showing you how devastating it can

388
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:55,320
be if you don't know who are you're

389
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,630
involved with your partner's other

390
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:59,609
management etc we had a case recently

391
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,649
where I was doing an anti money

392
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:03,418
laundering review at a credit union in

393
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:07,500
California that was going to Bank

394
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:10,009
cannabis and we were talking about

395
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:13,288
whether or not they had had actually

396
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:15,869
terminated any clients recently and they

397
00:18:13,288 --> 00:18:17,308
said yes they had had two gentlemen come

398
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:19,918
in there was a partnership of three

399
00:18:17,308 --> 00:18:21,509
people two people had come in recently

400
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,570
and they said they were completely just

401
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:26,879
ashen-faced than they were just so

402
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:28,379
downtrodden and they said we had to come

403
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,309
in and tell you personally that we just

404
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:35,610
found out our third partner had been

405
00:18:31,308 --> 00:18:37,200
sanctioned by the SEC and they knew

406
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:38,939
exactly what was going to happen which

407
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,169
was their account and they were they're

408
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,580
one of the few people that was lucky

409
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:44,038
enough to actually have an account in a

410
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:45,210
bank and the bat and the account was you

411
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:47,269
know they realized what was going to

412
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,670
happen the account was closed

413
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:50,599
they were back to zero all because even

414
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,700
though they were partners in a business

415
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:53,899
they hadn't looked closely enough to

416
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,059
each other to figure out what their

417
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,140
prior history had been and whether or

418
00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:00,049
not that was going to impact the

419
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,940
business and boy did it so turning you

420
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:04,609
to you Matt yeah you're the one person

421
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,230
has very hands-on experience

422
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:07,250
can you tell and I also know that you're

423
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,450
very familiar with a lot of these

424
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,970
systems because you and I have talked

425
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:13,880
about CD sales tracking systems which

426
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:15,620
was a good how important that is can you

427
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,990
talk to us a little bit about the

428
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:20,119
concrete steps that you tell people to

429
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:23,779
take and that Chiron has taken to

430
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:25,279
protect the company and and then I guess

431
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:27,109
the other two points I'd like you to

432
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:28,789
make are one about diversion because

433
00:19:27,109 --> 00:19:31,849
obviously that was your history at the

434
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:33,259
DEA you were a diversion expert and how

435
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:35,449
you help people deal with that in their

436
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:38,359
cannabis business and of course we need

437
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:41,180
to hear from you on the holes schedule

438
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:46,939
one to schedule 5 for CBD that's a whole

439
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:50,299
mouthful for you to take on yes so to

440
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:53,600
talk a little bit about my background as

441
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:55,159
Elaine mentioned I spent over 25 years

442
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,559
as a special agent with the Drug

443
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,029
Enforcement Administration and I'll just

444
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:00,980
answer the question you're all thinking

445
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:05,529
because I get it all the time so how did

446
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:09,380
you end up a DEA agent in this space

447
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:12,079
it's really been a pretty seamless and

448
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:16,160
easy transition for me because part of

449
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:19,279
my job responsibilities back in the day

450
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:22,970
if you will was when he was at the

451
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:25,240
beginning of the opioid epidemic I was

452
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:28,610
on the front lines of shutting down

453
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,500
first internet pharmacies where people

454
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:33,289
could go online and order a prescription

455
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,960
drug by googling hydrocodone without a

456
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:40,279
prescription web sites would come up

457
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,539
they would order vicodin and they

458
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:43,549
basically filled out an online

459
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:44,930
questionnaire that would be sent to some

460
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:47,869
doctor who could be sitting on a boat

461
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:52,480
the Bahamas who just hit click click

462
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:54,559
approve approve and what happened was

463
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,420
though that would be sent to an online

464
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,859
pharmacy Muslim or in Florida that would

465
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,050
just fill prescriptions and send them

466
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:02,839
out FedEx UPS all over the country

467
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:04,700
and the Ryan hate Act was passed that

468
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:06,859
mandated a face-to-face doctor-patient

469
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:09,259
visit before a prescription for an

470
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:10,609
opiate could be issued so the reason I

471
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:13,940
bring that up is because that was the

472
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:15,889
early stages of the opioid epidemic I

473
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:19,039
was at headquarters at the time it

474
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:20,990
worked with a guy named Joanna ZZ 60

475
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,849
minutes did a big report about that

476
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:25,370
because of things that happen that

477
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:28,359
shouldn't happen but when pain clinics

478
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:31,309
or oak internet pharmacies were outlawed

479
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:33,409
pain clinics became the norm because

480
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:36,619
they had a doctor on site and then this

481
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:40,790
issue just got worse and worse and worse

482
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:43,209
so when 60 minutes did their piece I was

483
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:45,379
interviewed as well and was on camera

484
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:47,630
what's happened over the years is I've

485
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:50,060
determined and and and believed which

486
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:54,250
I've heard much talk of here today which

487
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:57,589
I'm happy to hear that I believe and

488
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:59,119
many others do as well that medical

489
00:21:57,589 --> 00:22:01,579
cannabis can be an alternative to

490
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:02,559
opioids everybody in this country I'm

491
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:04,819
sure everybody in this room knows

492
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:09,200
somebody who's been touched by the

493
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:12,819
opioid epidemic whether it's a friend of

494
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:17,440
your child a child or friends of yours

495
00:22:12,819 --> 00:22:20,240
we all know somebody opioids and I was

496
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,220
running again I've been there opioids

497
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,870
and my far as I'm concerned of bad drugs

498
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:27,230
and they're dangerous and they're

499
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:30,979
addictive and people die so with with

500
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:33,140
that medical cannabis I believe is is a

501
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:37,009
good alternative written articles about

502
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:39,440
it as far as my work with Chiron I was

503
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:42,710
approached by another agent that I

504
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,559
worked with chi runs a company that is

505
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:50,140
the first seed to sale medical cannabis

506
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:52,250
company to be operating in Colombia and

507
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:55,100
Colombia legalized medical cannabis

508
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:57,019
about a year ago so I was recruited by

509
00:22:55,099 --> 00:23:01,069
Chiron to come in and stand up there

510
00:22:57,019 --> 00:23:03,859
compliance and regulatory division and

511
00:23:01,069 --> 00:23:06,049
what I've done is brought basically de

512
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:07,969
A's rules and regulations as it pertains

513
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:09,649
to regulating the pharma industry for

514
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:12,170
controlled substances to the cannabis

515
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:12,930
space the reason I think that's

516
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:15,570
important for the

517
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:19,500
folks in this room is because as only

518
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:20,879
you mentioned yesterday I'm sure many of

519
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,569
you know maybe some of you don't

520
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,280
DEA rescheduled CBD oil from a Schedule

521
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:29,490
one to a Schedule five controlled

522
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:32,190
substance which means that the Code of

523
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:33,870
Federal Regulations that are enforced by

524
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:36,809
DEA as it pertains to controlled

525
00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:40,739
substances will now be applied to CBD

526
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:43,980
oil and I think and I've thought for a

527
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:47,700
long time that that is just basically

528
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:49,860
the start of prohibition ending as we

529
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:53,340
you know CBD oil which has a very low

530
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:57,389
THC obviously if any THC content at all

531
00:23:53,339 --> 00:24:02,549
so methey a has already done so as far

532
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:06,600
as D scheduled so I think that this is

533
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:09,480
how this prohibition ending will evolve

534
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:10,769
from CBD oil to that medical cannabis

535
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,519
and we'll see where it goes from there

536
00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:17,700
so when that happens I think the DEA

537
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:19,440
will will take over regulatory for the

538
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,960
industry at some point I mean that could

539
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,970
be a big leap for me to say but I do

540
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,190
believe that the same regulations that

541
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:28,740
are applied now to controlled substances

542
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:30,870
for pharma companies will be applied to

543
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:33,329
the cannabis space the good thing about

544
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:36,659
that is it will bring consistent

545
00:24:33,329 --> 00:24:40,319
regulation to the cannabis industry so

546
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:42,029
instead of in Oregon where it's the

547
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:44,909
alcohol commission those folks that were

548
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:47,730
here earlier and other states where you

549
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:49,680
have it's it's the Health Department of

550
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:51,240
Health well whoever it is it regulates

551
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,789
the industry in every state it's

552
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:57,450
regulated a little bit differently and

553
00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:59,220
as the industry evolves and the

554
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:01,319
government evolves and prohibition ends

555
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,850
you'll see consistent regulation I think

556
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:04,500
throughout throughout the industry which

557
00:25:02,849 --> 00:25:06,809
I think will be a really good thing and

558
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,869
as the folks mentioned on the panels

559
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:11,549
prior that you know saving the industry

560
00:25:09,869 --> 00:25:13,019
it sounds like saving the industry in

561
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:16,049
this state means that you need to be

562
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:19,799
able to export to other states and and

563
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:21,720
maybe other countries and obviously

564
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:23,970
consistent regulation and prohibition

565
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,670
ending is going to bring that a long way

566
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:29,250
as far as the due diligence

567
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:33,390
we apply the due diligence standards

568
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:38,700
that are in the CFR to our regulations

569
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:41,790
in Chiron seed to sale in technology

570
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:44,750
that can advance and monitor seed to

571
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:47,009
sale is very important serialization

572
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:49,920
technology very important there are

573
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:51,599
software companies out there that you

574
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,700
may I don't I'm not sure if an are gone

575
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:56,519
if you're mandated to use one company

576
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:59,670
for reporting to the state if is that

577
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:03,389
the case here and in which company do

578
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:06,660
use Metro metric okay so some states use

579
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:10,290
bio track THC which is a company that

580
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:12,269
we're familiar with and I think a lot of

581
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:14,339
that has to do with both compliance to

582
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:17,460
prevent detect diversion but it's also I

583
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:19,529
think you know for tax purposes for

584
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:23,130
reporting so that they can tax the

585
00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:28,170
growers and whatnot but operating in

586
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:31,350
Columbia is a very unique and spin and

587
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:35,970
creates circumstances very specific to

588
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:38,339
the region but we I think that the same

589
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:40,380
same methodology can be applied anywhere

590
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:42,629
I mean we're starting we're starting a

591
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:46,590
company from scratch building a grow

592
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:49,880
operation on the equator and and you

593
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:53,609
know again because of Columbia being a

594
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:57,260
narco-state in the past with people like

595
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:59,879
Pablo Escobar and kingpins and cartels

596
00:26:57,259 --> 00:27:02,579
it presents a very unique set of

597
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,020
challenges for us that you may not have

598
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,490
here in the United States of course

599
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:08,069
because we're you know we're a different

600
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:09,799
society but when you drill down into

601
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:12,839
what it takes to operate a successful

602
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:16,559
regulated industry the same challenges

603
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:17,970
apply in Colombia that or anywhere in

604
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,210
Latin America South America that apply

605
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:23,160
here in the US so it's as Elaine

606
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:25,200
mentioned and my colleagues mentioned

607
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,330
here it's about the due diligence is

608
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,700
about you knowing your customer knowing

609
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:32,279
your suppliers knowing your vendors

610
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,140
doing that due diligence on on those

611
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:37,539
folks to ensure that they're not

612
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:39,690
involved in activity that may

613
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:43,000
bring adverse action against your

614
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:43,990
license and that's that's very important

615
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,990
to know the people that you're in

616
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:50,230
business with because that can lead to

617
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:52,599
big problems for you in in your

618
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:54,130
operation and and as another gentleman

619
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:56,259
on a panel previously said you know

620
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:59,620
asking for forgiveness is not an option

621
00:27:56,259 --> 00:28:02,109
so it's important whether it's your seed

622
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:04,869
to sale technology or it's knowing your

623
00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:09,069
your vendors and suppliers that

624
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:10,299
everybody is is well vetted and and

625
00:28:09,069 --> 00:28:12,519
you're doing business with people who

626
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:17,019
are legitimate as opposed to gray market

627
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:21,190
or black market folks so they come today

628
00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:23,529
cover I think Renard what what are you

629
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:25,570
would you say was the biggest legal

630
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:27,279
mistake people make in terms of getting

631
00:28:25,569 --> 00:28:29,889
their cannabis businesses going I've

632
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,839
seen indications now that litigation is

633
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:34,180
beginning we're partners may have

634
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:36,039
started off with a handshake and then as

635
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,620
the business grows they begin to fight

636
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:41,409
and then there's no contract or no you

637
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:43,179
know no corporate bylaws etc what are

638
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:48,330
you saying that begins to trip up

639
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:48,330
companies and cause them the most grief

640
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:56,650
you know they that would actually be an

641
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,269
interesting question to poll lawyers

642
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:01,780
working with the industry and they did

643
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:03,160
in my case and and I think with a number

644
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:10,930
of the attorneys I work more closely

645
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:14,860
with that that that kind of failure to

646
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:18,519
formalize what are in essence legal

647
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:20,769
relationships is is very high on the

648
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:26,829
list I think oftentimes there's a

649
00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:32,259
reluctance to a reluctance to go down

650
00:29:26,829 --> 00:29:35,740
the path of I guess reviewing all all

651
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:37,240
the ways you you you maintain a business

652
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,890
relationship with someone whether it be

653
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:42,279
a supplier or service provider or

654
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:43,778
whatever or quite likely a business

655
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:48,500
partner

656
00:29:43,778 --> 00:29:52,190
and going down that path of identifying

657
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:55,009
those areas where maybe you don't maybe

658
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:56,690
see eye to eye or maybe want to be once

659
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:59,509
one thing and the other one wants

660
00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:03,820
something else and so I think there

661
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:07,480
there can be an both a learning curve as

662
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:10,509
as businesspeople become familiar with

663
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:14,990
concepts like formal contracts but also

664
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:19,460
maybe a reluctance to have some of the I

665
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:20,960
guess more more pointed discussions that

666
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:24,528
you need to have on the front end and

667
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:29,240
then of course over time if you don't

668
00:30:24,528 --> 00:30:31,609
have a document that you and your

669
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:35,149
business partners or you and a you know

670
00:30:31,609 --> 00:30:37,759
another person or business can refer to

671
00:30:35,148 --> 00:30:43,759
to figure out what the rules are and

672
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:46,069
what the deal is then then the

673
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:49,398
relationship can start to drift and and

674
00:30:46,069 --> 00:30:52,158
and and and just like just like personal

675
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:53,898
relationships you know unless unless

676
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:57,320
there's a kind of an effort at that

677
00:30:53,898 --> 00:31:01,459
point to kind of bring things back in

678
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:03,319
line with with with an arrangement that

679
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:05,630
works for everyone then then you can

680
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:08,538
have those very expensive issues where

681
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:13,159
you know a healthy business is may be

682
00:31:08,538 --> 00:31:15,200
damaged or maybe needs to be liquidated

683
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:21,950
because some of the key owners aren't

684
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:25,038
getting along so yeah I just want to add

685
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:26,720
that's a really great point and my

686
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:29,349
practice does a lot of litigation

687
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:33,110
support work so we do a lot of

688
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:35,359
valuations economic damages work in the

689
00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:38,359
context of litigation I'd say one of the

690
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:40,879
number one reasons that you see people

691
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:43,398
in litigation around value of businesses

692
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,720
is that the shareholder agreement or

693
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:47,538
wherever the operating agreement was I

694
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,750
was constructed was was poorly written

695
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:53,148
and poorly executed every business is

696
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:55,009
either gonna be sold or it's gonna just

697
00:31:53,148 --> 00:31:56,319
you know liquidate at some point there's

698
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:59,200
not really any other outcome for

699
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:01,298
business so putting forth the initial

700
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,808
effort in the beginning to really make

701
00:32:01,298 --> 00:32:06,819
sure you define terms around value and

702
00:32:04,808 --> 00:32:09,308
ownership and what happens upon

703
00:32:06,819 --> 00:32:11,798
different exit scenarios what happens

704
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:15,339
upon you know an owner's death what

705
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:18,038
happens upon shareholder dispute of one

706
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:21,038
type or another is critical because you

707
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:23,769
know I'd say no exaggeration 50% of the

708
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:25,658
litigation work I see is due to poor

709
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:26,950
agreements and someone you know there's

710
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:29,110
a falling-out between business partners

711
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:31,028
and then there's a fight because it

712
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:33,459
wasn't clearly spelled out how the

713
00:32:31,028 --> 00:32:36,609
shares or how the interest the unit's an

714
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:38,230
LLC for example should be valued and it

715
00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:40,750
creates massive headaches super

716
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:42,009
expensive and it's you know but I'm so

717
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,509
just to your point I mean making sure

718
00:32:42,009 --> 00:32:45,759
those agreements are in place and really

719
00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:47,740
well-thought-out in terms of defying

720
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:49,720
like is it you know fair market value

721
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,909
do you have consideration of shareholder

722
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,980
discounts minority level discounts

723
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:55,809
discounts for lack of marketability all

724
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:57,759
these terms that appraisers use every

725
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:59,769
day obviously most business people

726
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:02,169
aren't necessary familiar with them but

727
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:03,849
just think about you know that that

728
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:07,200
question of value and what happens upon

729
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:10,558
some sort of exit okay and and just

730
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:13,509
because tax is kind of my area I will I

731
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:21,668
will without getting technical observe

732
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:26,528
that the the a common result of of maybe

733
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:28,720
being slow to address tax issues may be

734
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:30,579
in part because we as individuals you

735
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,980
know we kind of think about tax once or

736
00:33:30,579 --> 00:33:36,908
twice a year as April 15th approaches

737
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:41,860
and then maybe as the the extended

738
00:33:36,909 --> 00:33:45,549
deadline approaches it you if someone's

739
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:51,008
running a business say for a year or 18

740
00:33:45,548 --> 00:33:53,558
months dealing with all the complexity

741
00:33:51,009 --> 00:33:58,659
and and and so on and hard work that's

742
00:33:53,558 --> 00:34:01,509
involved it if they're not if they're

743
00:33:58,659 --> 00:34:03,159
not looking tax issues almost in real

744
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:07,818
time kind of on a monthly or maybe

745
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:10,349
quarterly basis which which can require

746
00:34:07,818 --> 00:34:13,588
maybe being a little bit forceful with

747
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:14,940
one cpa who might be used to clients

748
00:34:13,588 --> 00:34:18,389
that think about these things once a

749
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:20,940
year if you don't do that then you the

750
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:24,000
company can maybe just be starting to

751
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:25,918
become established you know maybe some

752
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,358
some people in the business are starting

753
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:31,559
to feel like they're hitting their

754
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:35,250
stride a bit and then you get to tax

755
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:37,940
return time march/april whatever and

756
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:40,378
then you suddenly realize you have a

757
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:43,679
$200,000 debt that you didn't know you

758
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:44,730
had before and maybe you just made a

759
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,099
business decision

760
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:51,030
two months earlier you know maybe you

761
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:53,399
just entered into a deal based on the

762
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:54,810
idea that you thought you had $200,000

763
00:34:53,398 --> 00:35:00,239
that maybe now you realize you don't

764
00:34:54,809 --> 00:35:02,670
have or or maybe that kind of issue

765
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:05,848
flows through to an a risk averse

766
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:09,139
investor so then at that point you're

767
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:12,269
getting the the email or the phone call

768
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:14,338
from the investor after they just had a

769
00:35:12,269 --> 00:35:18,170
very tense and uncomfortable discussion

770
00:35:14,338 --> 00:35:21,119
with their CPA or maybe their spouse and

771
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:23,039
and that that addressing the these

772
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,160
issues that type of issue on the front

773
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:28,920
end can be helpful but it's very common

774
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:31,500
that people aren't able to do that are

775
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,659
either abusing any intellectual property

776
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,420
problems coming up and maybe resulting

777
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:37,679
in litigation I've seen it bits here and

778
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,019
there but I don't know if you've dealt

779
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:42,539
with those yet they're coming for sure

780
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:44,460
yeah they're coming they're coming I

781
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:46,199
haven't dealt specifically with that

782
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:48,300
issue yet but I've been reading it you

783
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:51,328
know obviously it's in the it's being

784
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:55,260
discussed and the IP valuations in this

785
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:57,510
in the cannabis industry are you know

786
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:59,220
are very significant and there's a ton

787
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:01,920
of a lot of these operations or

788
00:35:59,219 --> 00:36:04,500
businesses the value really is in you

789
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:08,568
know the IP whether it be a license or

790
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:11,369
you know trying to a brand a trademark

791
00:36:08,568 --> 00:36:14,699
any sort of process I mean there are

792
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:16,619
patents being issued and and I think

793
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:19,359
there's gonna be litigation coming from

794
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:20,769
you know claims a patent and fringe

795
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,210
but but to answer question I haven't

796
00:36:20,769 --> 00:36:26,710
done anything specifically in that space

797
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:30,250
but I believe it's coming Lincoln do you

798
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:34,780
have any thoughts on what businesses can

799
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:36,820
do to identify IP that's going to be

800
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:39,760
worth protecting or going to be valuable

801
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:43,000
when they get to a point of potentially

802
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:45,970
selling the business yeah I mean I think

803
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,099
that's you know I think if you have if

804
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:51,039
you're let's say it's a product or a

805
00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:54,460
brand that's getting that's driving

806
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:57,099
value I mean certainly you know is you

807
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:59,440
know have someone look at that question

808
00:36:57,099 --> 00:37:01,480
for you and there's certainly IP is

809
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,250
valued every day and you look at a

810
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,710
business and you kind of allocate value

811
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:07,210
from the different assets in that

812
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:09,760
business one of those assets key

813
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:13,260
categories is intangibles which covers

814
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:17,170
you know patent and IP or other

815
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:19,900
intangibles but you know if if you

816
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:22,599
believe you have something of value that

817
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:25,269
is not a tangible asset there's a reason

818
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:28,690
why you're able to generate returns or

819
00:37:25,269 --> 00:37:31,679
earnings it's a good chance it could be

820
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:34,950
in an intangible asset having that

821
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:38,409
identified and patented or trademarked

822
00:37:34,949 --> 00:37:41,079
licensed in some way secures that that

823
00:37:38,409 --> 00:37:44,829
comes transferable that asset now can be

824
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:47,319
transferred to a buyer without that sort

825
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:49,719
of recognition or trademark or legal

826
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,190
protection a buyer's not going to pay

827
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:53,079
you anything for it because it's no

828
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:55,240
there's not there's no guarantee that

829
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:58,389
they'll be able to maintain the value of

830
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:59,889
that asset so I just you know if you

831
00:37:58,389 --> 00:38:01,900
think that you have a business that has

832
00:37:59,889 --> 00:38:04,089
intangible value you're thinking about

833
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:07,240
you know bringing in outside investors

834
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:09,550
or an exit scenario it behooves you to

835
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:11,469
have someone help you understand

836
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:13,180
quantify that and then talk about with

837
00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:15,579
an attorney obviously you know how to

838
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:18,399
license it how to protect it because you

839
00:38:15,579 --> 00:38:20,079
know a lot of businesses a large

840
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:25,090
percentage of the value is locked up and

841
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:27,190
that intangible value mat what I know

842
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:28,850
you do some reviews of cannabis

843
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:31,190
businesses

844
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:32,659
for operational and security problems

845
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:35,000
what sort of things do you find that

846
00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:39,099
people overlook in those situations that

847
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,099
cause them problems on those two fronts

848
00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:46,880
security and record-keeping are probably

849
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:49,130
two the the main issues I think that

850
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:53,090
that can get folks in trouble in regards

851
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:55,340
to compliance and reporting but when it

852
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:57,559
depending on whether it's a dispensary a

853
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:03,100
grow operation or what your business

854
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:03,099
operation tails we like to look at

855
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:10,690
cannabis operations is the way you would

856
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:14,119
probably fortify in the u.s. a bank with

857
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:15,980
CCTV coverage and and I'm sure that in

858
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:17,779
Oregon there are certain criteria that

859
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:21,740
are mandated by the state I know the

860
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:27,530
regulations are onerous and as far as

861
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:30,489
the the CCTV biometrics for employees is

862
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:33,230
very important I know somebody mentioned

863
00:39:30,489 --> 00:39:36,319
earlier about background investigations

864
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:39,559
on on employees and ensuring that they

865
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:45,260
they don't have any felony drug arrests

866
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:50,869
is is important diversion as it pertains

867
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:54,170
to employee theft and and loss is very

868
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:55,789
important we we through that through the

869
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:58,340
technology that's available that we're

870
00:39:55,789 --> 00:40:01,460
utilizing and tracking and tracing you

871
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:03,470
know from seed to sale you know it's

872
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:06,530
important to be able to put your your

873
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:09,019
fingers on a plant at any time during

874
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:10,760
the production chain during the supply

875
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:15,530
chain as it moves as it moves through

876
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:18,620
the growth process so protecting the

877
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:22,820
operation from outside infiltration is

878
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:26,119
obviously very important as is employee

879
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:30,740
theft and diversion and I think that you

880
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:32,329
know obviously this industry is is very

881
00:40:30,739 --> 00:40:34,509
you know it's a new industry and it's

882
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:39,110
evolving and credibility and legitimacy

883
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:41,010
are very important as we move forward so

884
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:42,780
that the folks that are the

885
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:44,940
naysayers out there don't have a leg to

886
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:49,530
stand on in regards to your operation

887
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:51,809
and being legitimate credible good

888
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:55,680
neighbors good in the community you're

889
00:40:51,809 --> 00:40:57,599
working within is very important because

890
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:59,190
right now there I think there are there

891
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,769
are there are believers in there a

892
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:05,460
naysayers just like anything else so I

893
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:07,019
think that it proves everybody to to be

894
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:10,110
good corporate citizens and be good

895
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:12,090
neighbors and to make sure that you have

896
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:15,150
the most robust security and compliance

897
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:17,100
program that you can both to protect

898
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:18,869
your own license and of course to

899
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:21,769
prevent death diversion or loss from

900
00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:21,769
occurring as well

901
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:33,380
I know a good number of businesses out

902
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:35,849
there and some some some businesses that

903
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:39,450
that I'm familiar with have had these

904
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:41,670
issues arise arise where they discover a

905
00:41:39,449 --> 00:41:45,569
diversion issue or they discover

906
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:47,039
something about a particular employee or

907
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:49,410
business associate do you have any

908
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:51,539
thoughts on how best to move forward

909
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:58,170
with those situations when they come to

910
00:41:51,539 --> 00:42:00,360
light I think you know if you have an

911
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:03,059
employee that stealing first thing you

912
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:06,960
need to do is terminate that employee

913
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:10,079
obviously and depending on on the scale

914
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:13,320
of the diversion and the theft you would

915
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:18,900
want to notify authorities regulatory

916
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:20,850
agency I think that if you just and this

917
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:23,160
is how it worked with the farm industry

918
00:42:20,849 --> 00:42:28,589
as well if you determine the diversions

919
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:31,199
taking place before they do that's much

920
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:33,200
better than being told by an outside

921
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:35,579
entity that you have a problem with in

922
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:38,509
it's going to be a lot worse for your

923
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:41,489
operation if a regulator finds a problem

924
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:42,780
that you didn't know existed and that

925
00:42:41,489 --> 00:42:45,629
happens in the farm industry all the

926
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:47,430
time and it's not good when it comes to

927
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:50,220
fines and adverse actions against their

928
00:42:47,429 --> 00:42:54,679
DEA registration so if you have an issue

929
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:57,119
within your operation and you can

930
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:58,349
talk to the regulators and bring it to

931
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,170
their attention say hey this is what

932
00:42:58,349 --> 00:43:03,719
happened but we dealt with it and this

933
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:06,450
person you know we notified local

934
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:09,089
authorities persons been terminated and

935
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:10,980
of course being able to determine

936
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:13,440
exactly what that looked like

937
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:17,400
from a theft and loss perspective

938
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:20,730
reporting it should put you in a good

939
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,820
place as far as where how you're viewed

940
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:25,650
by the authority as opposed to them

941
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:28,080
coming in finding there's something

942
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:30,240
wrong it's something missing and things

943
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,559
are missing now you have to find out

944
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:33,959
which employee you have a problem with

945
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:36,420
and then of course you could be dealing

946
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,730
with significant issues against your

947
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:40,590
license and so it's always better to be

948
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:43,170
ahead of that I would say and that's

949
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:47,250
about due diligence about doing audits

950
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:48,659
about inventories and hopefully that you

951
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:51,389
know the software tools that you use

952
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:54,659
will assist you greatly and and that

953
00:43:51,389 --> 00:43:56,009
aren't you taking thinking about time

954
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:59,219
for about one more comment we're running

955
00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:06,750
out of time sure just this is sort of a

956
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:09,269
a a lawyer comment the in a lot of these

957
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:11,849
situations in a lot of situations where

958
00:44:09,269 --> 00:44:17,519
people discover employee theft or a

959
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:20,639
really any number of I guess anxiety

960
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:24,360
producing scenarios which the industry

961
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:27,750
is familiar with given its history it's

962
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:32,640
it can be very important to take a deep

963
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:35,489
breath I think in my view and to meet

964
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:37,619
meet with your attorney or at the very

965
00:44:35,489 --> 00:44:40,729
least kind of have an internal sit down

966
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:44,539
within an organization and discussion

967
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:48,059
but me but but meet with an attorney and

968
00:44:44,539 --> 00:44:52,739
kind of talk through what's going on and

969
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:56,159
the potential implications and start to

970
00:44:52,739 --> 00:44:59,549
figure out how to address it in kind of

971
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:03,719
a methodical way and the reason I say

972
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:06,510
that is because so often it seems like

973
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:09,959
these these situations arise

974
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:11,730
and then because a company or an

975
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:17,159
individual takes sort of an iterative

976
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:19,260
approach you know maybe having a having

977
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:21,869
a discussion amongst the people in the

978
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:25,320
company other than the person that is is

979
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:27,239
a bad actor and and that maybe only

980
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,830
later then having a discussion with them

981
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:31,859
and then being undecided as to whether

982
00:45:28,829 --> 00:45:34,079
there's a way to remove that person from

983
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:36,740
the company because of these these kind

984
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:39,779
of iterative approaches and maybe even a

985
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:42,239
bit maybe a little bit too much of a

986
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:45,330
focus on what are the authorities going

987
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:46,319
to do if when they find out because of

988
00:45:45,329 --> 00:45:49,679
that you can end up with a scenario

989
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:53,490
where it looks worse than it is or it

990
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:56,519
looks like maybe more people in the

991
00:45:53,489 --> 00:46:02,159
company were involved in the bad acts

992
00:45:56,519 --> 00:46:08,039
then then really then really it should

993
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:09,569
and really it needs to we have one

994
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:11,279
questions we have one question and then

995
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:17,220
we'll wrap it up let's hear it again for

996
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:19,530
the whole panel everybody I my name is

997
00:46:17,219 --> 00:46:22,259
Roberto Robles I'm from Oregon I do

998
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:24,180
transportation policy and audit work and

999
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:26,750
what we found in the state of Oregon

1000
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:30,149
after the Columbia River Crossing

1001
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:32,690
debacle when we dropped the ball on

1002
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:36,869
building a new bridge to Washington

1003
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:41,070
because their data modeling systems were

1004
00:46:36,869 --> 00:46:44,329
inaccurate so I want to ask you guys to

1005
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:48,059
put on your risk audit policy hats and

1006
00:46:44,329 --> 00:46:51,210
look at the Cannabis systems at the olcc

1007
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:55,380
and are there gonna be any hidden

1008
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:58,320
skeletons in data accuracy data

1009
00:46:55,380 --> 00:47:00,450
transitions for how we manage those data

1010
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:03,510
systems because right now we could be

1011
00:47:00,449 --> 00:47:06,179
exporting our knowledge we can't export

1012
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:08,280
flour but we can export our knowledge

1013
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:09,750
and so I'm really concerned about the

1014
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:14,220
state of Oregon's ability to manage

1015
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:16,800
these databases well we do have experts

1016
00:47:14,219 --> 00:47:18,509
that are data analytic experts that look

1017
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,150
at that sort of thing and figure out

1018
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:21,460
where

1019
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:23,829
data is going and what you've got there

1020
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:25,360
but it's a very technical question and

1021
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:28,719
probably not one we can answer fully at

1022
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:31,960
this point I one of my colleagues from

1023
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:34,299
emerges is is here that might be able to

1024
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:37,409
speak to some specific specific issues

1025
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:39,700
there so I'd be happy to introduce you

1026
00:47:37,409 --> 00:47:41,649
great thank you let's hear it again for

1027
00:47:39,699 --> 00:47:45,069
a lady Harry and the rest of the panel

1028
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:47,619
that's FTI Consulting I'm sure they'd be

1029
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:50,120
happy to talk with you bore outside the

1030
00:47:47,619 --> 00:47:52,619
halls and once again let's hear a name
