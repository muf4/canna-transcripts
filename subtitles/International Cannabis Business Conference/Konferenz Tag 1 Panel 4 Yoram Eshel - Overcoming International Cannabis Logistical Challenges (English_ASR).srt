4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:14,580
familiarity who is here from Germany

5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:19,019
remember that who is here from Australia

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,899
oh Australia who is here from Israel

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:24,059
okay was he from Canada

8
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:27,739
good stuff so I'll tell you why I'm

9
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:30,118
telling I'm saying that so uh my name is

10
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:31,379
about four and a half years ago was the

11
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:33,899
head of global supply chain and

12
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:35,519
Logistics of Teva Pharmaceuticals you

13
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,380
know the largest generic company in the

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,059
world and I was in charge of all the

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,640
Teva logistic operations so I'm coming

16
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:43,500
from the Pharma world and my vision it

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,600
was actually to bring all the knowledge

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,979
the experience you know the

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,840
understanding of the pharmaceutical

20
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:53,878
world into the medical cannabis World hi

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,440
um so you may understand that if you go

22
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:57,119
back four and a half years ago a lot of

23
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,459
people a lot of you were busy around

24
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,378
licenses and cultivation and production

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,600
but nobody really thought about

26
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:05,640
logistics but I started to talk with

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,920
people about import export cannabis

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,118
whatever nobody really understood what

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,219
what is going on so since then we did 65

30
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:16,260
000 kilos of cannabis to and from many

31
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:18,599
many countries and we will talk about

32
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,140
that a little bit so this is all about

33
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:21,140
myself

34
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:26,700
few words about cannabilogue so we are

35
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:28,859
acting in many countries around the

36
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,259
world where you know we're doing a lot

37
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:33,060
of logistics and input and Export Canada

38
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:37,680
US

39
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:40,799
ugly Colombia Mexico countries in Africa

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,400
like Uganda Lesotho South Africa many

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,560
countries in Europe UK

42
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,659
and some others you can see here we're

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,240
doing about 70 80 percent of all the

44
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,979
Israeli important export and we're doing

45
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,239
a lot in Australia and New Zealand and

46
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:57,719
so on

47
00:01:54,239 --> 00:02:01,259
and the best thing here in this slide is

48
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:03,539
our new partnership with the qcs qcs is

49
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,519
a German company specializing in

50
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,719
Pharmaceuticals but also in cannabis

51
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:11,459
there are 15 offices around Germany and

52
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:14,340
in two offices we're doing a lot of

53
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:17,039
cannabis operation which is in Berlin in

54
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,500
Frankfurt so welcome qcs welcome Oliver

55
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,199
thank you very much

56
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,180
so we will talk today about few things

57
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:26,280
okay we'll try to understand what

58
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,020
happened in the last year and I'm saying

59
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,520
try to understand where person I'm sure

60
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,560
that we will be able to understand

61
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,780
everything

62
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,878
um then we will talk about the

63
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,979
you know the regulatory maze what's

64
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:39,959
going on around the world then we'll

65
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:42,719
talk about how to maintain quality and

66
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,180
integrity and in the end we will talk

67
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,400
about do it and don't when you go to

68
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,680
cannabis Logistics

69
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,280
so when we talk about cannabis Logistics

70
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,080
as you can see here we have six major

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,539
challenges

72
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,879
the first one is the Regulatory

73
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:02,579
Compliance

74
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:04,919
remember I ask you who is from Australia

75
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,980
who is from Australia

76
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:10,318
so they're sitting back there later

77
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:12,919
after my presentation please hug them

78
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:16,859
kiss them because starting this Saturday

79
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:18,000
they're going to have new regulations

80
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,920
and I'm not sure that everybody

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,658
understand the regulations

82
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,280
Germany as well you had a lot of

83
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:25,439
presentation this morning about what's

84
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,658
going on in Germany not sure that

85
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,459
everybody understand it this is one of

86
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:30,780
the major challenges to try to

87
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,019
understand what are the right

88
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,959
regulations and surprisingly enough you

89
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:39,239
will see written regulations but in

90
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,799
practice it works differently so there's

91
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,480
not necessarily a connection between

92
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,159
what is written in the regulation and

93
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,158
what is practically working

94
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,060
the second thing is around quality

95
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:50,939
assurance

96
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,199
guys medical cannabis is a medicine all

97
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,658
the government in the world will

98
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:56,818
consider it as a medicine leave aside

99
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:58,318
the Canadian the Canadian guys that

100
00:03:56,818 --> 00:04:02,098
understand that there is

101
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:05,060
what we call adult use or uh or uh I

102
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:07,259
don't know recreational use many names

103
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,420
just in Canada

104
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:10,679
all the rest of the world it's medical

105
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:13,559
cannabis

106
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,000
now maybe change in the future and if

107
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,160
it's radical cannabis in the medicine

108
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,600
and if it's a medicine you have to

109
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,720
adhere to all the pharmaceutical

110
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,419
regulations no matter what none of the

111
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:28,100
governments beside Canada will allow you

112
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:28,099
to do anything unless it's Medical

113
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:34,080
sorry there is a slide there expertise

114
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:35,939
you better know what you do okay in

115
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,698
cannabis you ship it

116
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:40,259
nicely you export it you're up to the

117
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:43,259
destination country if you cannot clear

118
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:45,660
it You Can Kiss It Goodbye

119
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:47,400
it will go to destruction and you will

120
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,139
pay for the disruptions so there's no

121
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:52,560
way back if you don't do the right thing

122
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:54,540
and you don't use the right methods it's

123
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,180
not going to work

124
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,520
security not less important that some

125
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,280
countries that were not even moving one

126
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,620
leaf or one flower unless we have a

127
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:07,019
armed escort some countries we don't

128
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,879
need that but security is an important

129
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:10,740
point and we will talk about loss

130
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,019
prevention as well

131
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,240
on-time delivery

132
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:16,799
very very important we're talking about

133
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,400
sensitive cargo we're talking about

134
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,439
temperature control if you delayed

135
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,299
somewhere for a few days you may lose

136
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:26,819
the whole thing so you better understand

137
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,800
the procedures and the last thing is

138
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:32,099
global yes

139
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,978
most of the economics today or was more

140
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,600
or less in country right Canada was a

141
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:39,959
big Market nobody even thought about the

142
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,759
export now everybody wants to export so

143
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,399
being Global understand what's going on

144
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,759
will open you new markets

145
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:50,099
for sure some news

146
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,780
your regulations in Australia we were

147
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,000
just talking about that okay very

148
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:55,019
unclear they're going to change in this

149
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,720
Saturday

150
00:05:55,019 --> 00:06:00,659
whether it goes with bad products or

151
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,580
packed products or what exactly they

152
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,759
will get

153
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:07,139
ghcp or they will get just EU GMP or

154
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,660
they have some agreements with some

155
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,879
countries not clear

156
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,139
neopetism in Thailand I don't want to

157
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,418
talk about it a lot of people are

158
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:18,240
talking about Thailand at that point of

159
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:20,758
life just forget it it's not legal to

160
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,259
input into Thailand and there's no

161
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,280
government maybe they'll change the

162
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:26,220
rules

163
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,619
a lot of input into Thailand not legal

164
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:32,340
so if you want to do non-legal stuff

165
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:34,918
okay but be careful with that

166
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:37,739
well new e usage facilities we see more

167
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:40,740
and more eug eugmp facilities in

168
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:43,620
Portugal in Malta some other places good

169
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,759
stuff industry challenges in Canada we

170
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,220
all know what's going on in Canada

171
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,720
Israel is facing the same thing some

172
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,940
companies are closed some companies

173
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,199
emerge some companies they do

174
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:54,660
acquisition

175
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,879
be aware that you know what's going on

176
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,439
in the market the organization in

177
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,120
Germany are not going to talk about it

178
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:04,019
in Israel they are considering to change

179
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,759
the rules and additional European market

180
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:08,339
where are the markets

181
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,379
besides Germany a little bit UK a little

182
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:12,538
bit Switzerland we want to see the

183
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:15,000
markets developing

184
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:17,159
so let's talk about regulations what I

185
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,779
did here is I just copied you Google

186
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:24,180
cannabis a legal or legal cannabis or

187
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:27,359
legal medical cannabis so you will find

188
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:29,400
a lot of maps a map like this

189
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,560
this is the left side is the

190
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,719
recreational the right side is the

191
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,720
medical

192
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,940
and you will find map like this

193
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,400
and if you keep Googling it even from

194
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:43,379
more maps if you think that there is any

195
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:45,299
connection between remote you're you're

196
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:47,939
wrong and the reason and the main point

197
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,680
I'm trying to take here is make sure

198
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:52,259
because the regulations are Ever

199
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,000
Changing what you know today will not be

200
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,740
there tomorrow and there are many

201
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,779
examples for that so when you talk about

202
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,879
regulations make sure that you

203
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:02,279
understand the right picture the current

204
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:04,800
Rock picture and not a lot of stories

205
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:07,799
because the maps are not telling the

206
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,020
truth there's a lot of changes send

207
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,598
things when it comes to Europe

208
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:14,399
can someone explain me what is legal and

209
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:17,339
what is not legal and what is the

210
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:19,879
recreation in Europe medical which

211
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:19,879
countries

212
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:25,199
Europe looks like this

213
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:26,240
is Europe looks like this

214
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,860
again

215
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,180
regulations are changing you have to

216
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,580
make sure that you fully understand

217
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,399
where it's legal and where it's not

218
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,500
legal okay I'll talk later on two words

219
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,019
about CBD I'm talking here about medical

220
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:43,320
cannabis that contain THC

221
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:45,000
be careful with that

222
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,399
another thing that we need to understand

223
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,679
that according to the UN

224
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,200
you know the U.N from a resolution from

225
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,639
1961

226
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,120
forced every country each country that

227
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:59,939
want to regulate cannabis to have a

228
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,339
specific unit in their government to

229
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:06,000
deal with cannabis so this is just an

230
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:08,160
example of all those authorized well

231
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,220
Regulators if I can call it this way

232
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:13,439
these are the guys that you will get

233
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:17,339
all the licenses that you need to grow

234
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,800
to store to manufacture to whatever and

235
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:22,740
also the Import and Export permits

236
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:25,559
each one of those guys as his own

237
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,600
procedures his own documents his own

238
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:29,819
application and each one of them will

239
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,740
take a different time some of these guys

240
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,379
will issue you an input permit or an

241
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,480
export permit in two days some of them

242
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:39,778
it will take six weeks

243
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,700
okay so you better understand which one

244
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:43,799
of the guys of those

245
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,140
Regulatory Agencies you are dealing with

246
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:48,479
what are the procedure how you can speed

247
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:51,299
it up and each country is different

248
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,940
remember medical cannabis is a

249
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:56,099
pharmaceutical product but it's not the

250
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,360
same every country has its own

251
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,500
regulations

252
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,500
all around the world

253
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,759
another thing that we have to talk about

254
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:08,100
is the type of products we in Canada we

255
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,259
are moving all those type of products it

256
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,899
can be genetics it can be seeds it can

257
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:14,819
be tissue cultures it can be cuttings or

258
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:17,159
clones

259
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,959
which is a completely different thing

260
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:21,000
I don't know if you know but when you

261
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,939
ship a clone

262
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,159
unrooted clone it has a life expectancy

263
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,260
of three four days after three four days

264
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:31,199
if it doesn't get into the water it's

265
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:34,139
dying so we have a very very strict

266
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,600
protocol how to ship Lawns or cuttings

267
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:39,778
or tissue cultures otherwise you cannot

268
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:42,000
do it so each one of those products will

269
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:45,240
have a specific solution or specific

270
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,578
Logistics solution but also in terms of

271
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,560
Licensing in terms of input regulations

272
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:51,419
and Export regulations some countries

273
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:53,578
have to involve the Ministry of

274
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:54,360
Agriculture not just the Ministry of

275
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:57,179
Health

276
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:00,180
a lot of issues to understand

277
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:01,559
dried flowers apis or I call it apis

278
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:04,500
because if from the farmer I mean

279
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:07,859
extracts okay packed finished goods

280
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,299
cannabis products herbal medicines CBD

281
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,120
products we'll talk about it in a minute

282
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:16,559
it's smokable product each one of these

283
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:18,659
guys will have this types will have a

284
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,819
different Logistics solution and a

285
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:23,458
different regulations that you need to

286
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:25,560
adhere to and again if you are in the

287
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:27,838
business you have to understand it and

288
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:30,000
you have to prepare for it and not just

289
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,040
shipping it out cannabis is not T-shirts

290
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,078
from Turkey it's not okay I have two

291
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:37,039
pallets on my ramp just ship it it

292
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:37,039
doesn't work this way

293
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,040
GDP there and GDP is the good

294
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:43,379
distribution practices something that

295
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:46,679
goes together with quality

296
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:48,179
so first of all Pharma standards this is

297
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:50,338
it if you are dealing with medical

298
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:52,799
cannabis you are pharmaceutical product

299
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:54,360
you like it you don't like it this is it

300
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,419
remember

301
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,700
it's an Agricultural Product it's not

302
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:01,259
chemical

303
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:04,680
derived Pharmaceuticals as we are used

304
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:06,360
to which create a lot of issues this is

305
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:07,979
why you will need steel things this is

306
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,320
why you will need laboratory tests you

307
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,659
will need a lot of things just in order

308
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,700
to ship it out

309
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:16,740
product Integrity along the

310
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,959
distributions chain eliminate

311
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,339
temperature excursions and we'll talk

312
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,619
about that in a minute

313
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:25,260
at the end of the day and the end of the

314
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,759
logistic chain there is a QP QP is a

315
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:30,059
qualified person that have to release

316
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:31,799
the product into the market these guys

317
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:36,179
I don't know if you know but the QP in

318
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:38,519
Europe is the most get the most uh High

319
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:40,078
salary in the industry because these

320
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:43,139
guys have

321
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:45,179
criminal responsibility when they clear

322
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:47,639
a product to the market they have

323
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:49,679
criminal criminal responsibility they

324
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,919
will never clear it until they will see

325
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:55,739
the whole tests and the Data Logger and

326
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:57,899
everything is correct otherwise they

327
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,459
will not clear it to the market very

328
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,839
very important

329
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:03,059
a lot of regulations are

330
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:06,260
counter-specific

331
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:09,359
full temperature control processes

332
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:12,120
specially qualify their packages data

333
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,820
loggers exactly is the farmer if you

334
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,620
ship it without it you cannot clear it

335
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:19,440
if you don't have a Data Logger if you

336
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,919
don't have the temperature records

337
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,740
nobody in Europe will clear it it will

338
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:29,000
approve the release to the market this

339
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,000
is it it's a medical product

340
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:35,099
sorry and the last week was make sure

341
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:38,278
that you understand your customer your

342
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,379
customer acceptance or rejection

343
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:43,259
um

344
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:45,240
uh criteria sometimes it's not on the

345
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:47,159
country level but it's your customer

346
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,620
that will tell you I need this in this

347
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:52,980
test so I needed this laboratory reports

348
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:56,278
or whatever the case is because if they

349
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:58,620
have an acceptance procedure and you

350
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:00,778
don't follow it they will not approve

351
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,060
the product you know when when it

352
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:05,639
arrives to their facility then it's too

353
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:08,819
late so make sure that you know your

354
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,620
customer criteria to reject or to accept

355
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:14,040
your products so it's not just the

356
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:17,519
country level it's also your customer

357
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:19,860
this is just a schematic chart how we

358
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,720
ship cannabis we collect it with the

359
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,459
temperature controlled truck we bring it

360
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,860
to the airport to temperature control

361
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:28,159
chamber we take it to the aircraft in

362
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,180
the temperature control environment

363
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,879
I mean take off

364
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:34,979
then land on the other side same exact

365
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,200
thing keep it in the chamber in the

366
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,879
temperature control chamber use a

367
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,278
temperature control truck to deliver it

368
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:44,220
and so on and so forth if you are not

369
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,360
maintaining the logistics chain as it

370
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,860
shows here

371
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,199
probably you will have a temperature

372
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,399
Excursion and the product cannot be

373
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:51,838
released

374
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,639
simple as that

375
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,519
so there are many issues around that

376
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:58,560
like stability data like all kinds of

377
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,320
Arrangements but in the end of the day

378
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,319
if your process your logistic process is

379
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,000
not qualified and it's not and all by

380
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,800
the way all the logistic partners that

381
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,860
has to be qualified the trucking company

382
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:13,799
the custom broker the airline or

383
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:17,159
whatever you're using then this will not

384
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,679
happen and if it not happened a product

385
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:20,958
will not be released to the market

386
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:23,338
[Music]

387
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:25,859
security and loss prevention I already

388
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:28,680
spoke about that to make sure that you

389
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,778
understand that you have to protect the

390
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:34,559
products you can protect it in many many

391
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:36,120
ways the packaging and tampering kinds

392
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,518
of Packaging

393
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,639
very very important secure

394
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:43,980
Transportation by the way some countries

395
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,659
will give specific license to the

396
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,180
trucking company otherwise they cannot

397
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:50,399
carry cannabis and it has to be sealed

398
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:52,620
in just to have GPS and you have to have

399
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:56,899
a lot of issues when you carry cannabis

400
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,899
in even in a van or in a truck

401
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:04,500
avoidance I spoke about that online

402
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:06,719
trackers there are many many types of we

403
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,179
call it data loggers right

404
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,980
I'm talking about temperature trackers

405
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:13,859
there are many types of them my

406
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:16,560
recommendation is to put

407
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:18,300
one Data Logger for each pilot or for

408
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,059
each package that they ship

409
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:22,859
two of them has to be online the online

410
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:24,659
data loggers will give you two

411
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,740
advantages that you don't have on the

412
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:28,559
regular one

413
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,360
first it will give you the location you

414
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,759
will know where it is because it's a GPS

415
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,879
system so you know where it is you know

416
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,379
if there is a delay or whatever and the

417
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:39,360
second thing which most important is you

418
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:42,120
know if there is a temperature Excursion

419
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,699
some of the logos will give you an alert

420
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,799
before the Excursion right if it's 15 to

421
00:16:44,698 --> 00:16:49,919
25 and all the Cannabis products are

422
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:53,039
being shipped between 15 to 25 Celsius

423
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:55,259
degrees so I don't need the alert when

424
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:59,099
it's 26. I need to alert when it's 24

425
00:16:55,259 --> 00:17:01,139
right so in order to avoid it you can

426
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,759
get alerts from this online data loggers

427
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:07,439
this is my recommendation and

428
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:09,900
they are available in the market the

429
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,480
other data loggers a lot of people will

430
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:15,000
call it USB data loggers I call them

431
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,699
postmodern data logos you know why

432
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,838
postmodo because you read it in the end

433
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:23,400
as my son says what was was nothing you

434
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,678
can do about it right you see the

435
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,780
temperature experience but you cannot do

436
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,419
anything with that it's already done but

437
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:32,819
if you use an online Data Logger you can

438
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:35,700
eliminate the Excursion even before it

439
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:37,558
happens very important and the last

440
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,779
thing is something that we provide as

441
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:41,819
well it's a very unique insurance

442
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:45,500
coverage for the whole Transportation

443
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:48,178
door-to-door process you know that the

444
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,579
receiving or getting insurance for

445
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:52,860
cannabis it's a little bit problematic

446
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:57,659
but we have a very unique insurance

447
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:59,099
policy that covers all risks for that

448
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:02,000
let's talk a little bit about the

449
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:04,918
process so you know that the the

450
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,500
Cannabis export starts from the import

451
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:10,200
side so if you have to issue an import

452
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:13,140
license on the destination country and

453
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,480
then based on that you have to issue an

454
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:18,299
export permit on the other side this is

455
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,400
the way it works this is the narcotics

456
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:23,519
in general is working

457
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,919
each side will take different time and

458
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,779
will require different information but

459
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,740
without the export permit and the import

460
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:30,538
payment

461
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,599
there's no way you can ship by the way

462
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:36,480
none of the airlines will carry cannabis

463
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,219
shipments unless you have licenses it's

464
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,500
a prerequisite the airlines will check

465
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,058
it by the way not all the airlines are

466
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,400
carrying kind of it's just few of them

467
00:18:42,058 --> 00:18:46,019
but if they do they will ask for your

468
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,419
licenses

469
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:52,079
this you cannot avoid this process and

470
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:54,900
it takes time sometimes it's sweat not

471
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:58,558
just uh you know the time but it is a

472
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:00,600
very important process and uh

473
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:03,119
one thing you have to remember to really

474
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:06,599
understand is that the information on

475
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:08,759
the licenses has to be identical if the

476
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:11,159
input license is not exactly as the

477
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:13,259
Apple sorry if the export license is not

478
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:16,798
exactly as the impulse license it's not

479
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:20,160
going to work so before in our company

480
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:22,879
we have a procedure that even before we

481
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,798
pick up a leaf or a flower or whatever

482
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,980
we take the documents we send them to

483
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:31,980
the other side like in Germany or in any

484
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,599
other country they check it they approve

485
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,940
it and just then we will collect the

486
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:39,298
freight or the cargo or the shipment and

487
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:41,340
we ship it out don't ship unless you

488
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:43,319
make sure that you can clear it on the

489
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:46,459
other side because it's not going to

490
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:46,460
work you lost it

491
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:52,500
so a little bit about

492
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:54,298
the physical Logistics so first of all

493
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,980
we spoke about the documents we spoke

494
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:58,619
about the packaging

495
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:01,620
you have to understand that you in in

496
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:04,079
campus shipments few agencies will be

497
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:06,839
involved in the U.S it will be the DEA

498
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:09,659
Customs minister of Health minister of

499
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:11,579
Agriculture FDA a lot of agencies and

500
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:14,160
you have to adhere to that

501
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:15,839
almost every cannabis shipment almost

502
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,759
every kind of a shipment will go through

503
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,019
physical check either in the

504
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,359
exploitation side or in the

505
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:23,639
implementation side which means it will

506
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,558
take time and it may even cost more

507
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,799
money because of storage and everything

508
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:32,099
so be ready for that almost every

509
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:34,500
shipment will be physically examined in

510
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:36,058
some countries like Australia it will be

511
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,679
current time you will need to quarantine

512
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:40,500
the shipment for few days before you can

513
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:43,860
clear it into the market so all those

514
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:47,400
aspects has to be considered before you

515
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:48,779
ship out of course GDP regulations and

516
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,480
there's something that you have to

517
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:53,399
understand you can there is a street

518
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,279
requirement that you control all your

519
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,500
supplies so it's not good enough that

520
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:00,480
you ship it out and you export it you

521
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,700
have to control the hallway until it

522
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,058
will arrive to the other side this is

523
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:08,700
the way your Regulators want to see how

524
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:09,359
you control your logistic chain

525
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,640
um

526
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,379
and this is a requirement it's not

527
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,700
something it's not a nice to have it's a

528
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,500
must

529
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,600
and we were talking about online

530
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:22,140
traceability

531
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:24,899
few words about CBD

532
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:27,799
so first of all CBD products

533
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:32,759
again we need to talk about

534
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:35,819
definitions okay so we recognize six

535
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:38,038
I would say types of CBD products the

536
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:39,538
first one is a medical product you know

537
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:42,240
there are two products in the world

538
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:44,220
that's it the epidural acts and the side

539
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,558
effects that's it that's the only

540
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:49,319
finished product that were approached by

541
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:50,819
FDA and they can be considered as

542
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:53,700
medicines

543
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:56,339
then we have the food and drinks you

544
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,600
know all the Edibles that we're talking

545
00:21:56,339 --> 00:22:00,240
about

546
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:02,459
then we have the food additives vitamins

547
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,380
novel food

548
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:07,019
novel food

549
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:11,640
from the UK here

550
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:14,700
novel food come on okay anyway so each

551
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:18,299
country even within Europe well UK is

552
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:20,340
not Europe anymore right but anyway

553
00:22:18,298 --> 00:22:23,940
um each country is is taking a different

554
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:26,099
definition for CBD food supplements

555
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,140
so what are we going to do with that

556
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:30,000
some will be vitamins some will be

557
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,460
edited or whatever

558
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,419
just to show you remember the map from

559
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,579
before

560
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:37,799
how we can manage that

561
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:39,779
then we have very Veterinary products

562
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:41,579
very good product if you have a dog

563
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:44,879
that's barking too much

564
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:47,339
CBD products put into sleep perfectly

565
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,280
really there are many products like that

566
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:53,939
then cosmetics

567
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:57,899
Cosmetics right creams things like that

568
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:00,659
there's a lot of products in the market

569
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:03,240
not each country will accept and the

570
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:05,039
last thing is smokable products you know

571
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,259
there are cigarettes CBD cigarettes as

572
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,700
well which is kind of funny right people

573
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:11,460
want to get high but they're still

574
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,700
smoking CBD but the most important here

575
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:17,340
is the top when I said

576
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,779
be careful with claims with cdb CBD

577
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:21,298
products especially if you're in the US

578
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:22,019
in the US if you're claiming that you

579
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:25,079
are

580
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:27,779
your product is I don't know anti-aging

581
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:30,359
or curing something or whatever

582
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:34,079
every day will run after you you cannot

583
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:37,619
claim any scientific

584
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:39,899
benefit or or I don't know therapeutic

585
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:41,759
benefit from your cdb products and the

586
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:44,100
reason is there's no proof

587
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,919
so be careful with that governments

588
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:49,319
doesn't like that and at the bottom you

589
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:51,299
can see again Europe right different

590
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:53,939
countries different levels of THC

591
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:55,500
different regulatory requirements

592
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,960
kind of a mess

593
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,538
yet again that's what I'm saying even in

594
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,240
CBD which is not not politics there's

595
00:24:00,538 --> 00:24:04,980
still things that you need to know and

596
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,200
again this is a little bit another map

597
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,579
remember the map is not important

598
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:13,580
because tomorrow it will be different

599
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:13,579
that's the message it will be different

600
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:19,380
so that's almost my last slide about do

601
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:23,099
and don't

602
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:27,360
the first thing is about licenses import

603
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:29,699
extra regulation and basic licenses

604
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:31,259
if you have customers sellers or buyers

605
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,120
you have to make sure that they

606
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:35,579
understand the procedures we found

607
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:37,739
ourselves sometimes teaching

608
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:39,899
again sorry for the example in Canada

609
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,480
teaching Canadian companies which are

610
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:44,580
great Growers of cannabis how to be

611
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,019
exporters in Canada

612
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:48,720
because they never had the experience

613
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:51,960
they have a very big local market never

614
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,839
exported so things like that

615
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,319
seller certification okay in some

616
00:24:54,839 --> 00:25:01,980
countries EU GMP is a requirement

617
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:03,178
c-o-mcs gacp iqc all kinds of letters

618
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,538
that I'm not sure that everybody

619
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:10,259
understand them but it's a requirement

620
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:13,379
so the seller certification is according

621
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:15,119
to the buyer regulations and if it

622
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,880
doesn't have the EU GMP you cannot

623
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:19,379
import it and by the way a lot of people

624
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,720
you will meet

625
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:24,600
will tell you yeah yeah we have a ugmp

626
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,100
we're in the process we have an audit in

627
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:28,859
two weeks

628
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:30,418
if it doesn't show on the eurodora

629
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:34,079
website

630
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:37,500
it's not a huge MP okay so stories we

631
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:39,319
know but facts this is what should be

632
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,259
considered

633
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:44,220
important I spoke about it quality again

634
00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:47,519
Laboratory test

635
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:50,700
coves a lot of requirements around it

636
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,379
everything has to be risk based you have

637
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:55,740
to do a risk analysis and risk

638
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:57,900
mitigation for each of your lanes so if

639
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:01,558
you are importing from ugly or from

640
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:03,840
Canada or your ship to Australia every

641
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:05,759
lane has to be analyzed you have to

642
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:09,058
analyze the risk and make sure that you

643
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:13,319
mitigate it okay no stories about that

644
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:16,879
temperature Excursion or an unmanaged

645
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:19,439
process can actually

646
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,600
bring into a situation that your project

647
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,538
will be rejected

648
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:26,158
security along the whole journey

649
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:28,798
dedicating the insurance coverage

650
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:33,120
packages laborers labels temperature

651
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:35,220
loggers everything has to be precise the

652
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,479
requirements for labels in Israel are

653
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,480
not the same as the requirements of

654
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,419
labors in Germany but if the labors on

655
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,460
the bag or on the box are not according

656
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:47,159
to the country specific

657
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,440
it's not going to work this is why if

658
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:51,778
you come to us we will ask to see

659
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,400
pictures of the labels even before we

660
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:56,278
pick it up so if the labels are not

661
00:26:53,400 --> 00:27:00,720
correct forget it and one more thing

662
00:26:56,278 --> 00:27:02,579
labels has to be printed Canadians don't

663
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,319
write it down in your handwriting

664
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:06,599
printed

665
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:09,839
okay

666
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:12,538
impossible practical procedure

667
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:15,778
I said before it's not always the formal

668
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:16,980
version okay I can tell you from our

669
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:19,619
experience

670
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:23,220
that we had the shipment from Canada

671
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:26,639
and the Canadian guys didn't pick the

672
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:29,100
bags correctly we delivered the shipment

673
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,320
to the airline Saturday evening it was

674
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:32,879
shipping to Israel Saturday evening we

675
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:35,099
deliver it to the airline

676
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,140
and there was a lot of smell

677
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:37,798
and then I said we're not going to carry

678
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,259
it

679
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:42,000
we're afraid that the passengers and the

680
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:45,179
pilots will get high

681
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,278
okay really real story so we had to take

682
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:50,940
it back to by the way I don't know if

683
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:53,159
you know there is anti-smel bags

684
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,720
so that's not around the shipment and

685
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:56,760
then we send it by a real story

686
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,940
sometimes you don't even think about it

687
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:02,460
so please when you're putting stuff in

688
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,620
bags make sure that you heat seal it and

689
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:07,500
not staple it

690
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:09,839
okay heat shield by the way twice this

691
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,839
is our procedure and if you're doing

692
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:14,819
Ziploc heat seal the bottom

693
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:17,339
and then the Ziploc and on the other way

694
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:19,500
around so make sure that you're doing

695
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:22,819
the right thing in order to

696
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:26,460
make sure that it arrives safely

697
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:29,460
plan your flights carefully

698
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:32,220
whoever shipped to Israel we have a very

699
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,620
weird procedure in Israel you can kill

700
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:38,640
clear cannabis products

701
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:40,619
just on Tuesdays between 10 to 12.

702
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,000
that's it

703
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:45,599
that's the law

704
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,220
now if you come on Tuesday evening you

705
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:50,099
have to wait a week

706
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:52,620
don't ask me why that's the procedure so

707
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:55,259
what we do is in advance we pick it up

708
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:57,178
on Fridays we fly it in on Saturday on

709
00:28:55,259 --> 00:29:00,298
Sunday make sure that we have it on

710
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:02,940
Monday and then we clear it so make sure

711
00:29:00,298 --> 00:29:06,619
that you understand another Point don't

712
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,620
ever never ever ever

713
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:14,038
land on U.S soil

714
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:16,140
okay never ever sometimes you don't know

715
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:18,538
that the airline

716
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:21,000
even very

717
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:24,119
sophisticated known Airline like the

718
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,700
German airlines without names

719
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:28,079
we land in the US we don't even that you

720
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,720
know that

721
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:33,240
he said goodbye it will be confiscated

722
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,720
okay so make sure that you are not

723
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:39,298
lending even not by mistake on U.S soil

724
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,179
that's it that's the the way it works so

725
00:29:39,298 --> 00:29:45,119
plan your flights carefully not just in

726
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:48,000
order for timing but also in the route

727
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:50,519
and as I said before

728
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,558
don't ever ship unless you make sure

729
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:54,839
that you can clear it on the other side

730
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:58,700
don't ship if you cannot clear it on the

731
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:58,699
other side there's no way back

732
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:03,679
so now I'm open to questions

733
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:14,568
thank you very much

734
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:14,568
[Applause]
