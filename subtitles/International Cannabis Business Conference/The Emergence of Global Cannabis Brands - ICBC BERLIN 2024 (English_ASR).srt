00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,800
cultivator we have an indoor cultivation

132
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,800
facility that's basically a high-tech

133
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,639
facility uh we started um with our first

134
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,520
brand was named seven seven is a purely

135
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,000
medical brand when we launched seven the

136
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,318
whole industry was just about tons of

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,879
products and we realized that if we're

138
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,120
going to make it here we have to really

139
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,680
do a good job of branding that it was

140
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,360
time for the industry to be branded so

141
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,918
we launched our first product looked

142
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,120
totally different from any other product

143
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:22,359
in the market and that's what made it

144
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,280
survive um we have brand recognition and

145
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,360
the fact that you when you see our

146
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:28,399
packaging then you see that it's

147
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,919
something different and you got to stand

148
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,758
out because you know guys we can't

149
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:34,359
advertise we have to find a way to stand

150
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,960
out so that's our first brand it's it's

151
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,120
seven it's an established brand in

152
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:41,120
Israel it's known for being premium

153
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,439
medical cannabis that doesn't uh

154
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,000
compromise and it's a brand you can

155
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:49,639
trust having said that two months ago

156
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,800
based on our reputation with seven we

157
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:54,400
launched our new brand called Solo solo

158
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,400
is a brand for the connoisseurs of

159
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:59,359
cannabis has sexy genetics that are

160
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:02,159
brought to the fullest when we put them

161
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,360
in the genetics we buy from We Bought

162
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,360
from overseas and we grew them in our

163
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,199
indoor cultivation facility so it really

164
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,840
brought out the very best of these

165
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:13,720
really sexy genetics now the power of

166
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:16,038
branding is that once we had our brand

167
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,400
when we went to the pharmacist B2B and

168
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:20,360
they knew that we were name that they

169
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:23,120
could trust then they just without even

170
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,120
trying they bought out all that we had

171
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,319
so that's a power of branding and I'm a

172
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,120
really really big believer and now we're

173
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:32,199
ready to go go out of Israel

174
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,038
yes thank you naris um we're going to

175
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:36,280
circle back to you a little bit more to

176
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:37,719
dive in more in just a minute and of

177
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:39,799
course we are here to talk about the

178
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,520
evolution of branding and how that can

179
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,240
work um across the global supply chain

180
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:46,318
so first I just want to level set for

181
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,280
everybody here and kind of Define a

182
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,280
brand a little bit my favorite

183
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:52,959
definition of what a brand is is is what

184
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,918
people say about you when you're not in

185
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,318
the

186
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:59,519
room and so Brands include both hard and

187
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:02,319
soft attributes hard attributes kind of

188
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,038
being that logo the colors what does the

189
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,039
packaging look like what is the actual

190
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:09,038
product of course and then also those

191
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:12,360
softer attributes the personality the

192
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:14,079
emotion that it evokes in you uh so

193
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,759
we're going to hear more about that from

194
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:19,038
these amazing panelists and to Circle

195
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,240
back naris you you began to touch on the

196
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,519
two brands that you have and began to

197
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,560
delineate them tell us just a little bit

198
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,598
more about that dig in a little bit more

199
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,240
um and if you could give us kind of a

200
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:34,158
timeline of how long did it take for

201
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,399
these things to to develop because a lot

202
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,278
of folks go to digital marketing

203
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,918
agencies and say design me a logo throw

204
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:42,200
it up on a website and we're good we

205
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,679
have a brand it's a lot more complicated

206
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,120
than that so much more complicated first

207
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:48,278
of all you have to make sure that you're

208
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,720
branding what you want to Brand you have

209
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:52,919
to make sure that one message that makes

210
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,320
gives you the unfair advantage that

211
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:57,559
that's what's getting across so we

212
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,200
started with the packaging like I said

213
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:00,799
you know in our in our Market we can't

214
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,360
add advertise we don't have a lot of

215
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,399
room to do anything so we started with

216
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,680
the

217
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,039
packaging we were lucky because the

218
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:10,838
packaging really stood out and we had

219
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:12,799
really good genetics even from day one

220
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:18,160
but we were extra lucky because our our

221
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:20,399
signature product was perfect for Israel

222
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:23,639
PTSD now when you have a product that

223
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,519
works for PTSD in the in the the in the

224
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:27,278
the patients right back to you and say

225
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,600
this is doing well it's it's it's

226
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,919
helping me with with my condition it's

227
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,560
not making me paranoid I can continue

228
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,679
doing my work with using this product so

229
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,319
this one product is what really got us

230
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:41,159
off the

231
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,240
ground that 3 years later one product is

232
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:45,278
not enough if we hadn't built it into

233
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,120
our brand when we when we introduced the

234
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,958
other products we have a total of six

235
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,799
products in the uh in the seven brand so

236
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:54,879
when we launched each product because we

237
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:56,919
had already branded the the concept then

238
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,799
the other products just rolled right in

239
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:00,120
and they knew what to expect from the

240
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:04,159
product and that's the power of the

241
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,320
brand so we took time but cannabis time

242
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,000
um I know in in the in the other world

243
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,278
the rest of the world that we most of us

244
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,519
came from takes a lot longer to build a

245
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:15,838
brand but for for the Cannabis industry

246
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:18,200
everything is is on high speed so it

247
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,959
took time but but not that long when we

248
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:24,720
launched our solo brand it was like that

249
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:27,838
um because we had the reputation of the

250
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,440
seven brand uh so so one one actually

251
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,079
complemented the other you're creating

252
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,880
an ecosystem exactly and then I just

253
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,078
give the audience a little bit of an

254
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:38,838
update on the medic the the market there

255
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,399
in Israel um some medical markets

256
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,720
patients don't really get to have a

257
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,639
choice in what they're they're you know

258
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,360
getting from their pharmacists so can

259
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,879
you ex uh just give us a little

260
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,159
explanation there sure well Israel's

261
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:54,519
Market is going through Rapid change

262
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:56,199
surprise surprise um on the 1st of April

263
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:59,440
we have a new reform that went into

264
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,560
effect it's a it's a growing reform it

265
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,360
take about a year before all of it goes

266
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:06,759
into effect but what happens initially

267
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,000
is that until now you had to get a

268
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:11,439
medical license once you got a medical

269
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,159
license then you would go and have your

270
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,120
prescription the prescription would say

271
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:17,078
which category you can use how much THC

272
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,360
how much

273
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:22,799
CBD and um and you could go in and look

274
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,120
at a menu of of a drugstore look at the

275
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:28,078
menu and decide what product you want

276
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,200
out of that uh those categories one

277
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:32,359
difference which is pretty

278
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,200
made a huge difference is that the first

279
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,639
time you go in and the first product you

280
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,480
can get had to be from the category

281
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:42,879
there was one by oneon-one THC balance

282
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,560
THC CBD and that changed the market that

283
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,919
one

284
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:49,159
little they they wrote it about this big

285
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:51,360
in the regulations changed the market

286
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:53,799
because as someone coming in they had to

287
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,278
have something that wasn't this how much

288
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:57,799
THC can I can get can I get so that made

289
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:00,200
a huge difference in the market and and

290
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:03,479
the way the market uh behaves

291
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,759
and um in this new the new regulations

292
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,519
that are coming

293
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:09,240
through you don't have to have a license

294
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,278
you start you just go to your

295
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,680
professional the person who treats your

296
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,838
condition and he can write a

297
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:16,319
prescription that's exciting so we

298
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:18,800
expect the market will really really

299
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,440
grow really really fast yeah the market

300
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,000
Evolution there is something that I want

301
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,880
to Circle back to um but first I know

302
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,958
that you're looking to expand and I want

303
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:30,159
to uh hear from the panelists a little

304
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:32,399
bit about what to look for and expanding

305
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:33,679
with different brand partners and Alex

306
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,679
if that's something that you could take

307
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,838
cuz I know you have a lot of experience

308
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:39,719
growing from different markets Southern

309
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,040
Southern California Northern California

310
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,959
and east coast of the us all quite

311
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:47,599
unique markets right now so uh if you

312
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:50,719
could share some of your comments sure

313
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,519
sure um I think you know when you look

314
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,920
at expanding a brand you've already

315
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,879
established yourself in whatever your

316
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,759
base Market is and so you have hopefully

317
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,720
some

318
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,879
efficiencies you know in that time in

319
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,560
your supply chain and I think that's one

320
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:07,879
of the most important things that can be

321
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:10,319
overlooked when you're expanding into a

322
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:12,759
new market is you have to understand

323
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,199
that a new market there's probably a lot

324
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:19,198
of new operators it's hard to know who

325
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:21,679
is let's say experienced and has

326
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:24,039
different skill levels so it's very

327
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,799
important to vet all of the different

328
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:28,319
operators in the market know who your

329
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,759
partners are in your supply chain before

330
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,440
you get to too far along because

331
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:35,399
obviously small problems can become big

332
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,399
ones along the way very quickly um so

333
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,078
just understanding your business model

334
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:41,720
and who you're going to be getting into

335
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:43,958
business with in that market and um

336
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,920
knowing that your retail outlets you

337
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:49,278
know as you expand are going to you know

338
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:52,000
be viable and accept your branding and

339
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:54,360
your products yeah yeah thank you for

340
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,278
outlining those things for us and now

341
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,440
actually Lauren I'd love to hear from

342
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:01,000
you and if you could share a little bit

343
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,720
of the back ground about Tokyo smoke the

344
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,679
evolution there and I think as you share

345
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,759
that story we'll hear the evolution of

346
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:11,120
the market and the kinds of things that

347
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:12,519
Alex just just touched on but Lauren if

348
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,639
you could share the story about Tokyo

349
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:17,399
smoke it's hard to do that in a few

350
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,839
minutes but um we started out to build a

351
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:23,360
global brand it wasn't about building a

352
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:26,880
um it was really about building a Global

353
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:30,120
brand and um it was very much about my

354
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:33,198
DNA that I'd spent already 30 years

355
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:37,480
building my brand which um was part of

356
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:39,958
the DNA of Tokyo smoke and we sold Tokyo

357
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,480
smoke in 2018 if you go into a Tokyo

358
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:44,879
smoke store today it looks exactly the

359
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,320
same way it looked because our DNA was

360
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:50,759
so strong I think our success was

361
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,120
building a community from day one we

362
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,800
were a education retailer and one of our

363
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,679
Great Tricks was you know give us your

364
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:00,359
email address and we'll send you a pack

365
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:03,278
of rolling papers I think we sent out

366
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,800
probably 25,000 packs of rolling papers

367
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,439
and that started to build a community

368
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:09,799
and then I started traveling around the

369
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,639
world and meeting with kings queens

370
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:14,719
Prime Ministers heads of state and the

371
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,720
CEOs of the largest companies in the

372
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,040
world telling them out how we were going

373
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,320
to change their lives and that stuck

374
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:25,838
Tokyo smoke stuck everywhere we went and

375
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,959
even today it's still the I think the

376
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,880
most notable brand in the Cannabis

377
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:34,919
industry except

378
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:37,278
bang which Speaking of Jamie will you

379
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:39,078
outline the history of bang for us as

380
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,318
well and and you know illustrate for the

381
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:43,159
audience the journey that bang has gone

382
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:44,799
through with with Market Evolution as

383
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:46,958
well you know was it starting out with

384
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:49,479
everybody really wanting the highest THC

385
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,318
and then you know where we know um well

386
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,560
the first thing I want to say is um

387
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:56,278
people often confuse products with

388
00:15:53,559 --> 00:16:00,039
Brands oh yeah that's I I brought

389
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:03,240
laurena bang chocolate um allegedly

390
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:05,519
um people confuse brands with products

391
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,399
and a brand is not a product and that

392
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,919
happens a lot and I also think people

393
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:13,360
confuse companies with Brands and those

394
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:16,198
two things are not the same either so um

395
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,039
bang was a it started out as a product

396
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:22,318
it was a chocolate bar and uh when it

397
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:24,399
started out we're talking about 2010 you

398
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:27,399
could buy a brownie that would have in

399
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,720
Sharpie on a Ziploc bag one gram of

400
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:33,039
cannabis was used to make this brownie

401
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,519
and the founder of bang who was a master

402
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:38,198
choler said this is medicine this is

403
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,600
crazy we have to elevate um so that

404
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:42,439
people could actually know how much

405
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,959
cannabis they were going to get so fast

406
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,720
forward

407
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:48,359
um bang was known for its logo it was

408
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,839
known for its tagline it was known for

409
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,800
its packaging all of those things but

410
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:54,560
what what I did when I came in they

411
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,078
hired me to expand the brands when I got

412
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:58,879
there we were in California when I left

413
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:01,838
we were in seven states Canada and I

414
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:05,119
took our CBD brand prior to novel Foods

415
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,439
into uh Europe uh what I did is made

416
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,038
sure that we were speaking with one

417
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:13,360
unified voice and the one because a

418
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:15,038
brand voice is super important um and so

419
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,318
the one thing that I had a mandate from

420
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:20,400
the CEO who was the CEO before I took

421
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:23,838
over was we're not going to use the

422
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,919
obvious bang as sex cuz imagine all of

423
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:28,438
the things bang well bang often

424
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,559
everybody wanted to use bang as sex we

425
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:34,120
did not want that to be our our brand

426
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:37,119
voice um he wanted he said this this

427
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:40,079
plant is female I have a daughter I want

428
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,918
to I want to be proud when people talk

429
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,240
about bang I want them to be talking

430
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,880
about quality I want them to be talking

431
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,440
about different things so we made sure

432
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:52,320
that our brand voice spoke to a

433
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,320
particular audience so what I did is I

434
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:57,319
actually head hunted a brand expert um a

435
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:59,439
brand expert in voice and if you guys

436
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:01,200
raise your hand if you know the brand 19

437
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,960
crimes

438
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,798
wine okay so short story I went in the

439
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,079
grocery store on a way to a birthday

440
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:11,038
party I bought a bottle the Checker made

441
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:13,599
me stop what I was doing made everybody

442
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:15,960
go to another line and showed me the

443
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:18,639
augmented reality of how to make that

444
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,319
label come to life uh using the living

445
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,000
wine label app and I thought how did

446
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:25,558
this person turn the Checker in the

447
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,400
grocery store into a brand ambassador so

448
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:29,558
I called A girlfriend of mine that does

449
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,200
head hunting in the wine industry found

450
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:33,240
the woman that did that brand head

451
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,759
hunted her and she became my my head of

452
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:40,519
brand um and so she smart yeah um the

453
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:43,960
brand voice of 19 crimes she modeled

454
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:48,079
after Jax from sounds of Anarchy and she

455
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:50,159
said women who are 35 buy wine that's

456
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,879
the our biggest buyer and it was cheap

457
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:55,240
Australian wine and I need to get the

458
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,000
women that are you know between 28 and

459
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,679
36 you got to know your demographic who

460
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,038
are you talking to with your voice I

461
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:06,360
need those women to buy my brand I'm not

462
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:08,038
going to talk to them in their voice I'm

463
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:10,719
going to be aspirational everybody

464
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:12,279
wanted to have sex with Jack from Sons

465
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,600
of Anarchy so I'm going to talk to them

466
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:18,279
in the bad boy voice that's how 19

467
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:21,158
crimes was uh was built and it was that

468
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:23,399
voice so when you think about it every

469
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:26,080
bottle as a criminal the whole thing was

470
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,919
about crime and the voice was the voice

471
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,558
of a criminal that's it it doesn't

472
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,559
matter you don't have to speak the voice

473
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:35,918
of your customer you have to speak to

474
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:39,519
your customer and she did she and I did

475
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,320
the collab together with Jim balushi um

476
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,079
and and it was a fun project and he came

477
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:45,519
here and talked about it a couple times

478
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:49,000
so the evolution went all the way full

479
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:51,879
circle but our biggest issue I think in

480
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,038
glowing Going Global was making sure

481
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,960
that we didn't use any false friends

482
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:58,158
it's called so I'll just give you one

483
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,798
example and then I'll turn the mic over

484
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:02,960
clar

485
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:05,319
did a product in Germany that was a

486
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,360
curling iron that would give off little

487
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:12,798
steam and they called it a Mist stick

488
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:15,319
now in German the word Mist means

489
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:17,440
[ __ ] and shtick you know what shtick

490
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:20,960
means right so they named their curling

491
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,200
iron a [ __ ] stick and that's the type of

492
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,558
mistake that Brands make when they don't

493
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,679
understand how to cross cultures so one

494
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:31,678
of the things that I did having lived in

495
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:34,679
Europe and America for the last 30 years

496
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,640
is I made absolutely sure we didn't make

497
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,759
any of those missteps there's a lot to

498
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,440
it and Alex talked about supply chain

499
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,319
supply chains after your Brand's been

500
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,360
built but he's right you've got to make

501
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:48,759
sure your brand Works across supply

502
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:51,759
chain and those are some of the you know

503
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:53,720
the voice uh just some of the basics and

504
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,759
so I learned a lot of that the hard way

505
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,960
in the Cannabis

506
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:00,240
industry I was going to just add that I

507
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:03,038
think the clearer you are about your

508
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,319
brand and what it is the easier it is

509
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:08,759
for people to accept and I think a

510
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:10,960
moment for us was when my son said to me

511
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:14,038
we're going to be the Starbucks of

512
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,278
cannabis and we were in a conference

513
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:18,679
like this and there were two slides and

514
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:21,599
he showed Tokyo smok's logo and he

515
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:23,919
showed Starbucks logo and that stood in

516
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:26,678
everybody's

517
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,000
mind that makes a mark and also

518
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:30,240
everybody in this room knows what it

519
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,359
means to be the Starbucks of something

520
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,440
right so that's almost the epitome of

521
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:36,639
branding right there I think today um

522
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,720
we're building choco and choco is going

523
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,759
to be the soo Soho House of cannabis so

524
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,558
we want to get it early in somebody's

525
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:47,200
mind exactly what we're going to be so

526
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:49,000
they know it and they get it and they

527
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,759
associate it's easier with a frame of

528
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,278
reference yeah exactly now um I want to

529
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:58,599
turn to talk a little bit about uh where

530
00:21:55,278 --> 00:22:00,079
a market is how to know uh where your

531
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:01,879
Market is what kind of audiences that

532
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:04,839
we're going to talk that you're going to

533
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,679
talk to obviously regulations play an

534
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:09,278
important role of what you can and can't

535
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:11,600
do there's always workarounds there's

536
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:12,798
always loopholes so I'd love to hear I'm

537
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:16,158
going to just throw this out whoever

538
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:18,038
wants to jump in uh let's you know let's

539
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,919
focus in on Germany of course the

540
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:22,759
cultivation model right now uh there's a

541
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:24,720
lot of things you can't do we're going

542
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:26,960
to find out a lot more about what people

543
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,400
can do as we see people do things and

544
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,440
take risks um I'd love to hear from each

545
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,640
of you what excites you what kind of

546
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,840
opportunities do you see for here in

547
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,840
Germany for

548
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:39,000
Branding naris you want to go first I'm

549
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:40,720
going to let one of you guys start

550
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,679
because I don't know enough about the

551
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,120
brands in Germany I'm looking forward to

552
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:46,600
learning about them you're here doing

553
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:48,918
market research oh absolutely love it

554
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:51,439
well I'll jump in on that I think uh on

555
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:54,840
the rec side of things uh with the

556
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,519
social club model um the regulations are

557
00:22:54,839 --> 00:23:00,879
nebulous so from an American standpoint

558
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:02,079
uh that's why open and like you know and

559
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,960
the Germans are going to say you can't

560
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:07,879
do that it says it has to be uh

561
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,519
nondescript well describe non descript

562
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,720
we haven't done that very well so I'm

563
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:13,798
going to exploit that to the ends of the

564
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:16,759
Earth and what I anticipate will happen

565
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:19,319
with the social club model is my Social

566
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:21,679
Club is better than your social club and

567
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:24,759
it's going to be like the football team

568
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,798
concept and you're going to have Brands

569
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:30,119
so that when you send flower out the

570
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:31,720
door uh the companies want you to know

571
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:33,918
where want people to know where that

572
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,679
flour came from because when you think

573
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,400
about 25 grams is what you can have on

574
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:41,400
your on your person when you're out in

575
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,759
public that's 25 one gr joints that's a

576
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:48,960
lot of weed I mean who needs 25 joints

577
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:54,079
in their pocket at anyone okay okay fair

578
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:56,558
enough fair enough but if I got 25 1 G

579
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,839
joints in my pocket and they're they're

580
00:23:56,558 --> 00:23:59,798
packaged in a brand we we know that

581
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:01,240
they're going to end up in other

582
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:02,679
people's hands and that's how you're

583
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,798
going to start building a brand and I

584
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:08,120
think on the consumption side on the

585
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:09,879
social side we're going to see branding

586
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:11,119
and I think I think they're going to be

587
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,200
Germans who are going to take those

588
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:15,038
risks too on the medical side that's

589
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,440
what I'm excited about because I do

590
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:19,919
think uh the majority of cannabis in the

591
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:24,679
US is used for medical reasons sleep

592
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:27,399
pain anxiety cramps whatever it is and I

593
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:29,159
think it's going to be used medically

594
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:31,719
also in Germany but people are going to

595
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,480
want the government to reimburse them

596
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,919
they're not going to want to use their

597
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,919
disposable cash cuz why would you why

598
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,120
would you go to a social club and spend

599
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,960
a bunch of money when you can just have

600
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,719
the government pay for it and I think

601
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,720
it'll get there maybe not initially but

602
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,440
eventually and I think that there's an

603
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,919
opportunity for brands in the medical

604
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,640
side of things and that's really where

605
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:53,520
I'm focused and what you said about the

606
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,919
uh Social Clubs being kind of the first

607
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,839
to jump out and brand I think is pretty

608
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,600
accurate like in the US we have a lot of

609
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:02,359
retailers moving to branding themselves

610
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:04,158
and putting their brand into people's

611
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:07,240
pockets as opposed to selling somebody

612
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:10,520
else's and um you know I think there's a

613
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:12,919
lot of creative leeway as you said for

614
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:14,440
Social Clubs to find ways and especially

615
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:17,000
as you're bringing a lot of people from

616
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,640
the Cannabis Community together for you

617
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,839
know it's all it's already there but

618
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,600
bringing them in a place where you know

619
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:24,759
now there's a stamp that says this is

620
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:27,278
legal people are going to be more open

621
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:29,319
and willing to conversate and you know

622
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:31,398
talk about what they like in the market

623
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:33,119
and what brands stick out to them and so

624
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:34,879
I think it's a great opportunity for the

625
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:37,398
Social Clubs to be the first to take

626
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,919
that leap cannabis people are workaround

627
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:42,239
people that's who we've always had to be

628
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,120
and we'll find a way oh we'll find a way

629
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,440
and cannabis people also really care

630
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:48,959
about where their weed comes from what

631
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,558
goes in it you know who's growing it um

632
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Alex you've had a lot of experience with

633
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:54,599
that with humble's finest in the

634
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,840
California Community can you tell us a

635
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:59,439
little bit about the market there and

636
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:01,319
the appetite for people to know who's

637
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,159
behind their brand and how it's grown

638
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:07,158
and things and that sure yeah it um in

639
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:08,760
California it took a little while to get

640
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:11,760
people interested in where their weed

641
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:13,480
came from um and even today you know I

642
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,640
think at least in in the legal Market

643
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,519
where we're the legal Market

644
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,000
conversation with Bud tender and you

645
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,679
know information on the packaging yeah

646
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,558
absolutely and um you know one thing we

647
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:27,960
learned very quickly when retail became

648
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:30,398
super abundant is your butt Tender Is

649
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:33,079
your best point of access to your

650
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:36,158
consumer you know you get to as a brand

651
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:38,839
have these very short quick moments with

652
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,559
consumers to try to educate them and you

653
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:42,599
know you have to have very concise

654
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,359
powerful messages in order to really

655
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:46,038
make it stick in their mind because

656
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:48,359
their kids in a candy store you know

657
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:51,119
there's loud packaging all around them

658
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:53,319
and you know a lot of like buy this half

659
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:54,839
off and you know it's very hard to

660
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:57,038
really get their attention to something

661
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:59,038
valuable and so when you have a bud

662
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:00,798
tender that's excited and educated on

663
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,919
your brand as she mentioned with the 19

664
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:05,319
crimes wine like they sent everyone to

665
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:07,759
the other line just to talk about it and

666
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:09,798
so when you can find and it's going to

667
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:12,679
be different in every market and even to

668
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:15,679
a degree every store you know what

669
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:17,919
excites that Canabis Community the bud

670
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:21,120
Tender Is the Catalyst for all that yeah

671
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:24,080
we actually at bang had um a two-tiered

672
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:26,278
marketing strategy we had a a direct to

673
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:28,879
consumer marketing strategy where we

674
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:31,679
spoke to our consumers but then we had a

675
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,520
bud tender strategy and it was all about

676
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,519
putting swag in their hands and and

677
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:38,200
educating the bud tender about bangs so

678
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:40,359
that when the clientele that bought

679
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,480
chocolate wasn't usually the 24-year-old

680
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:45,918
male um our clientele were people that

681
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,399
wanted to usually use it for sleep so it

682
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,320
was an older demographic um and getting

683
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:53,359
Bud tenders excited about chocolate was

684
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:55,960
really hard um so we had we did a lot of

685
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:57,798
things we did collabs with flower Brands

686
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,319
and pre-roll Brands where we would give

687
00:27:57,798 --> 00:28:01,918
away other brands pre-rolls and flowers

688
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,639
so we could get the bud tender to sit

689
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,320
still and listen about the chocolate so

690
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,240
when older people came in they would

691
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:09,879
actually know something and that was

692
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,480
actually really effective so you also

693
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,399
have to understand sometimes you have a

694
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,120
gatekeeper and you got to get around

695
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:18,479
that gatekeeper so that was why we had

696
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:20,678
to have two strategies and I'm hearing

697
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,599
with that that I just want to point out

698
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:24,559
the the market Evolution kind of follows

699
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:26,319
this typical pattern of people a market

700
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:29,240
launches first and people really want

701
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:31,839
flower they want High ATHC and once they

702
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,278
kind of get that okay then there's more

703
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:36,359
we're more curious about other um other

704
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:38,278
consumption methods like chocolate so

705
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:41,158
that creating that direct Bridge is a

706
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:42,599
really effective strategy and naris I'd

707
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:46,039
love to hear from you if there's

708
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:47,719
anything uh different or tactics that

709
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:49,558
that uh you have implemented for the

710
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,919
Israeli market for the consumer

711
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:54,879
education the pharmacies Etc well of

712
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:57,200
course just as Jamie said we have two

713
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,840
audiences we have those who are selling

714
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,519
the product and we have to Market to

715
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:02,599
them just as if they were the target

716
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:05,679
audience while at the same time we're

717
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:08,918
targeting our actual target audience but

718
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,880
um it's hard it's hard because we're not

719
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:12,759
allowed to advertise we're not allowed

720
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,440
to say that our product does what it

721
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:17,960
does and we're in a medical cannibus

722
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,880
market so um we've we found that um one

723
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,360
way to educate the customer and this is

724
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,200
important the customer doesn't know what

725
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:27,398
it is he needs to do to do what to make

726
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,240
the Cannabis work for him we found that

727
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:33,278
was very important so we put put

728
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:35,519
together a a podcast um which I gave but

729
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:37,359
wasn't obviously seven because we're not

730
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,359
allowed to do that so I just gave a

731
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:43,678
podcast about cannabis sponsored by

732
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:45,119
seven and uh and we gave work around

733
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,399
yeah you just have to find a way to do

734
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:50,439
it it took off really well uh we talked

735
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:52,239
about the regulations what you need to

736
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,880
do to get a

737
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,278
license once we bought in doctors and

738
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,360
say I have a specific medical condition

739
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:01,440
what do I need to do what cannabis

740
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:03,759
there's so much out there how do I know

741
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,440
what to start with so we brought on

742
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:08,398
doctors and I would interview them I

743
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,600
would make sure that they gave as much

744
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,918
information as they could very short

745
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:13,839
podcasts people don't have a a large

746
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:16,320
attention

747
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:19,000
span tip very smart the brand name is

748
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:21,439
seven so what was the podcast seven

749
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,119
minutes so you got you got to make sure

750
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,399
everything is branded and um you have to

751
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,719
get around you have to get around the

752
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:29,678
the regulations you have to get around

753
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,240
what's allowed and what's not allowed I

754
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,480
think you said something before that

755
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:37,278
really matters is that strains

756
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,839
matter and that's what matters and

757
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:43,480
strange cares abut so strong because if

758
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:45,158
your strain stands for something then

759
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,798
you don't have to advertise they know

760
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:50,039
the strain and everybody sorry and

761
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:52,960
everybody knows the strain they like I

762
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:55,720
said strains win and every place the

763
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,798
strain wins and whatever that strain is

764
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,839
that when the cop or whatever it is is

765
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:02,879
that's what everybody wants and I would

766
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:05,678
say our success is that we have the

767
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,480
largest strain library in the world

768
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,919
whether it's Californian whether it's

769
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,200
land race whether it's Canadian and

770
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,840
that's what will win across all markets

771
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:17,960
will be your strains in in the flower

772
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:21,319
segment for sure and I think to nisa's

773
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,720
point um you've got to remember that in

774
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:24,079
Emerging Markets the people that are

775
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,558
going to walk into the dispensary are

776
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:28,119
the ones that have the courage to walk

777
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:29,678
into the dispensary uh with the stigma

778
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:31,278
being as strong as it's always been it's

779
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,320
sort of like walking into a massage

780
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:35,038
parlor uh people don't want to have

781
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:37,079
their car in the parking lot they don't

782
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:38,638
really want to walk in and when Alex is

783
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:41,519
talking about all the branding being

784
00:31:38,638 --> 00:31:44,479
loud I imagine my mom walking in and

785
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,079
going oh my gosh like not a kid in a

786
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,278
candy store wanting to run in the other

787
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:52,480
direction um that my mom's probably

788
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:54,960
going to be wave four you're going to

789
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,599
have the the young people who are like

790
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:02,200
yes coming in first the the evolution of

791
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:05,398
education has to um evolve with the

792
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,319
evolution of the um consumer that's

793
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:10,319
going to walk into that store and what

794
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:12,918
happens to Lauren's point is at we're

795
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:15,519
seeing this in California now weeds like

796
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:17,799
wine there uh some people like P Noir

797
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,399
some people like svon Blanc people start

798
00:32:17,798 --> 00:32:22,000
developing a taste they know what they

799
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:25,000
want and you need the strain Library if

800
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,200
you're in the flower department to

801
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,278
really appeal to the developing tape

802
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:34,038
because people become very sophisticated

803
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:35,919
in their cannabis palet exact so that's

804
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:37,638
that's true obviously for for

805
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,440
recreational Cannabis but for medical

806
00:32:37,638 --> 00:32:42,038
cannabis is just is true and that's not

807
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,240
what a lot of people don't understand

808
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:46,240
because one strain can be wonderful for

809
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,759
me if I have a specific indication and

810
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,359
can do nothing for the person sitting

811
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,158
next to me who needs something different

812
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:53,918
and the education has to get out there

813
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,440
and it's just um it's difficult they're

814
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,519
not helping us out getting that

815
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,759
information out there so we have to find

816
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,359
a way around it exactly helping

817
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,398
consumers understand what kind of

818
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:06,038
questions to ask the benefit of being

819
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:08,158

cabanos what does that sound like

843
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:02,439
cannabis so our advertising agency came

844
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:04,559
out and said you know what we're not

845
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:07,639
going to advertise medical cannabis

846
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:11,639
we're going to advertise medical

847
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:14,279
cabanos medical sausage exactly but when

848
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:18,119
you say when you say it sounds like

849
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:21,240
cannabis so we took a local standup uh

850

very famous standup comedian and he went

851

00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,878

863
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,358

895
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:07,960
best way would be to utilize that uh

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,079
that feedback we get from the community

897
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:13,800
and put it into our branding um we have

898
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:16,119
a few brand ambassadors but it's very

899
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,800
traditional is there any expertise you

900
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:21,680
could share from your side to to kind of

901
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:25,280
you know have better ideas thank

902
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:27,118
you sure uh I would say just you know

903
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,000
building Brands throughout the years and

904
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:32,760
kind of having to change and evolve as

905
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
the consumer Market matures it's really

906
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,359
important to make sure that you're

907
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,480
getting a wide range of feedback and

908
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:40,519
it's not small Pockets I think something

909
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,679
that you know a few of my Brands and I'm

910
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:45,000
sure others in the market have dealt

911
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:47,118
with is you get one brand rep coming

912
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,838
back to you like oh somebody didn't like

913
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:52,039
the product and but they say it as

914
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:55,239
people don't like the product and then

915
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:58,759
if you're not really diving in and

916
00:36:55,239 --> 00:37:00,959
actually getting um real data from the

917
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:04,720
market back and then getting that from a

918
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:07,280
wide range you're potentially going to

919
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:09,279
isolate these single cases of hey we

920
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,440
need to make this change or that change

921
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,240
but you know the General market might

922
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,039
feel a different way so I think you know

923
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:18,239
just making sure that you are thorough

924
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:20,880
in that analysis and that you're able to

925
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:23,399
communicate directly up the chain with

926
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,559
like true data from the market is really

927
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,358
important we just had a conversation

928
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:31,679
last night about the fact that uh Tik

929
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:33,719
Tok is really it's really what's what's

930
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:36,118
coming the up the generation that's

931
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:37,598
coming up uh they're into Tik Tok and

932
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:40,000
that's that little short burst of

933
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,200
information so if you ran a Tik Tok

934
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,599
campaign where you were able to get some

935
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:46,480
of those

936
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:49,318
um testimonials on video and you could

937
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,760
have your brand with the testimonial so

938
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:54,559
the Tik Tok campaign or the T um

939
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,200
Snapchat campaign or the insta campaign

940
00:37:54,559 --> 00:38:00,039

00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:06,838
basically putting the word of mouth

944
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,880
right out into the market yeah you can

945
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:11,480

957
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:34,358

00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:49,400
question here

please oh hello uh I'm here representing

966
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,720
Isabella Palazo from Italy's Association

967
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,720
for medical cannabis patients and we

968
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:57,799
would love to know your thoughts on the

969
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:59,838
Italian cannabis market for medicinal

970
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,240
marijuana we haven't heard so much about

971
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:04,358
Italy what are your thoughts we're a

972
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:06,078
branding panel so I'm not really sure

973
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:08,639
that that's something that we're up here

974
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,920
prepared to talk about it it is an early

975
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,358
Market though so you know be prepared

976
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,920
for what we've talked about here with

977
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:16,719
the market Evolution um and I think

978
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,838
we're all probably happy to to answer

979
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:23,759
other questions IND but I would say that

980
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:26,440
it's huge and nobody's talking about it

981
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,040
we're talking about it we care it's it's

982
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,480
