35
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,859
topic cannabis to the normal people like

36
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:29,099
my mom and my dad that's what we do

37
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:31,400
thank you and Kenna traders is the

38
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:33,839
oldest cannabis expo in switzerland

39
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,439
what's the story behind that how did

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,609
that happen

41
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:40,109
in the 90s it was not illegal to grow

42
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:42,750
wheat in Switzerland

43
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:46,109
it was just illegal to consume it as a

44
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:49,078
narcotic so we had hemp pillows for

45
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:51,090
example we had the aroma bags called the

46
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,819
dogs actually probably somebody if you

47
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,219
remember that time we could smoke in the

48
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:59,519
trains we could smoke everywhere we had

49
00:01:56,218 --> 00:02:02,218
more weed stores in Basel than bakeries

50
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:05,879
it was really a crazy time and in that

51
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:07,649
time it cannot read was the third hemp

52
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:09,538
Fair in Europe there was the high life

53
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,780
in Holland the common business in

54
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,739
Germany both of them are no more

55
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,020
available on the planet

56
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,020
so canna trade is the oldest still

57
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:22,530
existing a hemp Fair in Europe maybe in

58
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,550
the world I don't know so and we're

59
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,259
going to come back to some of those

60
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,850
elements because you know we're talking

61
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:28,620
about how different jurisdictions sort

62
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:30,569
of play on each other and how something

63
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,060
that happens in one can affect what

64
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:34,500
happens in the other and Emmanuel tell

65
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:39,659
us a little bit about yourself and in

66
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:43,110
palico and so yeah well first of all my

67
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:46,020
nickname is Amy my long name is Emmanuel

68
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,780
I'm doing business in a cannabis for now

69
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:52,110
20 years and I'm very proud that I can

70
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:56,310
say we are one of the oldest clients of

71
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:58,800
the of cannot trade of pain it's really

72
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:02,400
we we made her high times the nice times

73
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,880
and also not on that nice years to Cara

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,069
and last 20 years on the european on the

75
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:11,430
german market a lot happened we started

76
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:13,949
with magazines or we have like the

77
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,719
biggest magazine on the german market

78
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:18,000
it's a cost-free magazine and

79
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:21,210
distributed through cro shops and head

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,840
shops and with the time we tried a lot

81
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:26,719
of projects we feel very active istic we

82
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,129
are coming from the activist scene and

83
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:32,550
through the times we tried many many

84
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:35,609
projects and in this moment we are a

85
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:37,969
network of seven companies across whole

86
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:41,730
europe doing a lot of things and

87
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:43,919
actually I'm Holly crow which is in this

88
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:48,030
moment the most active company I have to

89
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:51,379
say is dealing with CBT we made three

90
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:55,140
years ago a decision not to take part in

91
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:58,319
the pitting to supply the German market

92
00:03:55,139 --> 00:04:06,149
with medicinal cannabis we decided to

93
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:07,859
call the CBT away and yet just just to

94
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:11,490
make it round we are neighbors we have

95
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,590
really some aspects of history which

96
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:19,109
which are really parallel and

97
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:22,259
really similar but one aspect and this

98
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:25,979
is very interesting to understand Europe

99
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:27,689
to understand we speaking sometimes even

100
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:31,560
the same language but having taught a

101
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:34,319
different system so in Germany the

102
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,160
consumption of cannabis never has been

103
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:40,259
forbidden its exact opposite of

104
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,450
Switzerland but of course the possession

105
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:45,750
buying and selling was totally

106
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:47,789
prohibited and it's why this combination

107
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,490
with one border made a lot million

108
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:53,180
German people going to Switzerland when

109
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:56,970
there was the very nice time and again

110
00:04:53,180 --> 00:05:00,600
people are going to Switzerland now to

111
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:02,130
buy CBD cross and there's an American

112
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,230
connection there as well we were

113
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:05,370
discussing this earlier probably about

114
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,740
20 years ago

115
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,918
High Times did a story on a dual citizen

116
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,240
who is American and Swiss and she had

117
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:13,859
gone to Switzerland and found out that

118
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,720
they had never actually made it illegal

119
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,389
they just kind of assumed it was illegal

120
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,979
so nobody was doing anything with it and

121
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:22,918
she opened a hemp farm and would have

122
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:24,418
people come and visit and you know we

123
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:26,459
were also talking a little bit about how

124
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:30,109
California and what happened here

125
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:32,579
so what San Francisco started licensing

126
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,620
dispensaries here we were able to use

127
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:37,709
that in Vancouver to get licenses there

128
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,569
in Vancouver also you know some some

129
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:41,699
when the border started closing down a

130
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:43,459
lot of BC bud wasn't getting across the

131
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,659
border anymore which sort of spiked

132
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:48,539
Washington California and Oregon to go

133
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,910
even to step up production and something

134
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:53,040
similar happened when Switzerland kind

135
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,930
of cracked down which we didn't quite

136
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,300
get to so there was a middle phase where

137
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,829
Switzerland was doing all of the stuff

138
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,930
that Ben mentioned and then it sort of

139
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:03,180
stopped and when it stopped it started

140
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,829
kind of encouraging more Germans to kind

141
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,509
of start growing for themselves as well

142
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:08,129
was there anything else you wanted to

143
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:10,168
kind of say about that time period and

144
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:14,459
how that how your two countries are sort

145
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:16,259
of how they affect each other well to be

146
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:20,878
honest the first one have been added

147
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:22,800
touch for sure they had a first show and

148
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,889
because they are good neighbors they

149
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,250
share what they have a lot of Germans

150
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:32,150
lot of with Swiss people love to go to

151
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:35,819
Amsterdam and to enjoy the nice

152
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:38,250
circumstances and that's why and it's

153
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:41,759
it's also a matter of the hippies coming

154
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:46,199
back from Goa from India and apart came

155
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:48,569
back to California apart came back first

156
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:51,120
to London then to Amsterdam and then

157
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:54,689
from there to Germany and to Switzerland

158
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:58,050
so that's the history and yeah

159
00:06:54,689 --> 00:07:01,889
sadly the Dutch shipyard don't happen

160
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:04,918
anymore and also sadly all that German

161
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:07,918
fear also don't happen anymore but this

162
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:10,709
makes the conductor age really the

163
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:14,038
oldest fear at least as I know also in

164
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:16,680
on this planet because I don't know any

165
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:20,959
other fear which I think it's not 18 so

166
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:24,569
it is edition isn't it almost yes I

167
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:26,370
think maybe Hempfest in Seattle as you

168
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:29,009
people maybe one or two years in terms

169
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:31,860
of world stage OPA I don't know that I

170
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:36,449
don't know about the earlier hemp scene

171
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:38,338
in the US so sort of a unique thing it's

172
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:40,050
not other other festivals haven't quite

173
00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:43,709
had the same sort of pedigree and

174
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:45,120
holding together so Germany I started

175
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:45,388
medical cannabis program a little while

176
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,639
ago

177
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:49,560
and then sort of sputtered on it and

178
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:52,978
then started buying cannabis from Canada

179
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,930
instead and now there are tenders that

180
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:58,560
have been accepted by the government but

181
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,819
nobody's been told yet who they are you

182
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,500
talk a little bit about that and the

183
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:04,460
impact that's having on on patients in

184
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:07,709
the medical market in general one day

185
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:08,930
Hollywood will make a really interesting

186
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:11,728
movie about it

187
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:16,038
two years ago the German parliament

188
00:08:11,728 --> 00:08:20,788
voted for the patients to supply them

189
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:23,038
from German cannabis from companies two

190
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:26,668
years later there is still no German

191
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:31,228
cannabis available last year we imported

192
00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:34,168
exact 26.9 tonnes from Canada

193
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:37,679
mostly 98% something like this

194
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:39,629
so the happy Canadians I'm very happy

195
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,269
for the Canadians they have full

196
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:44,870
legalization meanwhile but it meant for

197
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:49,709
the German patient again there was no

198
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:52,169
cannabis on the German market so this

199
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:54,208
was really exceptional law the German

200
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:56,578
parliament voted and first time after

201
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:59,039
Second World War a full Parliament 100

202
00:08:56,578 --> 00:09:03,359
percent of all parliamentarians voted

203
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:05,819
for one law and two years later we see

204
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:11,810
this law doesn't really help the

205
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:16,199
patients and this days the responsible

206
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:19,500
governmental office declared the tender

207
00:09:16,198 --> 00:09:25,139
which was given is no it's now finished

208
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:28,049
and the companies which when the tender

209
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:31,589
will be proclaimed and in the next days

210
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:37,319
or weeks but if you compare what has

211
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:41,600
been tendered it's about 2.6 tons per

212
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:46,140
year which is given in certain different

213
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:49,519
pieces so it could happen you will win a

214
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:53,909
tender for producing 200 kilograms of

215
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:56,519
cannabis flowers each year what is

216
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:58,078
nothing especially when you see already

217
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:01,649
the consumption numbers and the

218
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:04,109
prescription numbers when when you see

219
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:07,379
the consumption already last year was on

220
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:09,899
the level of nearly 27 tons and the

221
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:13,259
tender is about 2.6 tonnes

222
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:18,089
you see excellent possibilities for all

223
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:23,578
licensed producers which fit the GMP

224
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:26,760
level and the country has an agency for

225
00:10:23,578 --> 00:10:30,439
cannabis installed so they can take part

226
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:33,328
and please send more cannabis to Germany

227
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:36,959
yeah I cannot tell anything else it's a

228
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:40,439
huge opportunity for everybody because

229
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:44,309
the market just started and

230
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:47,900
is we we are now at a level of 40,000

231
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:51,529
patients with real prescription about

232
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:55,829
two-thirds of those people are getting

233
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:58,409
rebounds it by the healthcare and the

234
00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:03,360
dimension it could happen we will have

235
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:07,490
four million patients so you can upscale

236
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,539
yourself and and imagine their fantasies

237
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:12,180
yeah well and it's a good thing that is

238
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:13,649
tenders offered finally because you're

239
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:16,529
not gonna be getting a lot more cannabis

240
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:18,600
from Canada we when we started with a

241
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:19,980
recreational market patients started

242
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,600
finding it very difficult to access

243
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,700
medicine

244
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,440
those of us in BC that are used to a

245
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,020
different sort of level of cannabis in

246
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,970
West Coast cannabis aren't very happy

247
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:31,439
with what the legal product looks like

248
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,690
and so when we hear that it's going to

249
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,190
patients in other countries it actually

250
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,720
doesn't make us feel very good because

251
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:39,810
we don't really want that's not the

252
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,060
cannabis we would choose to send you

253
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:44,729
know thankfully there's some movement on

254
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:47,279
the CBD side you know we were talking

255
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,139
also about how this twists into some

256
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,769
people seem to think that THC is harmful

257
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:54,029
and CBD is beneficial so there's last

258
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:55,559
panel mentioned there's a lot of

259
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:58,409
Education that needs to be done about it

260
00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:00,269
but at least there's for some conditions

261
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:02,699
for some people they can access CBD

262
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:04,799
particularly in Switzerland so

263
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,200
Switzerland's had a bit of a resurgence

264
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:10,859
I'm not quite like it was in the old

265
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,930
days and a little bit about that in 2011

266
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,570
nobody knows why but the Swiss

267
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:18,029
government changed the law of producing

268
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,890
him usually in Europe and as well in

269
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:23,129
Switzerland it was allowed to grow up to

270
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:26,189
0.2 or 0.3 percent of THC and

271
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:29,879
Switzerland changed that to 1% of THC

272
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:32,700
and then it needs some years up to 2016

273
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:35,189
we're the first company get the license

274
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:38,970
to sell it officially as a tobacco

275
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:40,650
substitute weed and now two and a half

276
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,710
years later we have more than 500

277
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:46,199
registered companies you can buy weed in

278
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:48,000
every supermarket at every gas station

279
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,390
at the highway everywhere you can buy

280
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,809
wheat as a tobacco substitute and across

281
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:57,110
that people started fast to a

282
00:12:53,809 --> 00:13:00,229
you CBD oil CBD extract and as you may

283
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:04,940
may better know than me with the plant

284
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:08,450
up to 1% THC you can grow up to 25 30 %

285
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:10,730
of CBD so actually we are a strong

286
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,950
player on the worldwide CBD market

287
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:15,589
because of that even if Switzerland is a

288
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:17,778
high in production high and paying

289
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:22,339
everything but we are now a partner and

290
00:13:17,778 --> 00:13:24,860
as well it feels like it's the the food

291
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:27,589
in the door we have now many many

292
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:31,250
companies big companies with big indoor

293
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:33,800
producing facilities factories so we are

294
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:37,129
ready for the THC everyone is just

295
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:40,879
waiting for it and Dubai side a lot of

296
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:43,129
money in the CBD market yeah and I mean

297
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,289
that's that's its own kind of crazy

298
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:47,929
thing you know when we legalized in

299
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:50,559
Canada we actually changed so we've had

300
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:52,819
legal hemp farming for quite a long time

301
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:54,588
but they weren't allowed to actually do

302
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,150
anything with the product they could

303
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:57,170
grow it they could take the fiber out of

304
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:59,870
it but they weren't allowed to actually

305
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:01,099
extract anything from it at all now

306
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,230
they're gonna be allowed to extract

307
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,629
things and sell it so it was good news

308
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,820
for hemp producers and we're gonna start

309
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:10,159
seeing CBD in natural healthcare

310
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:13,460
products and cosmetics and topicals and

311
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:15,620
things like that but we already as soon

312
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:20,060
as that was announced the market was

313
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:21,200
flooded with 100% legal CVD we see the

314
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:23,179
same thing happening in a lot of

315
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,270
American markets but it's like oh no CVD

316
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:28,099
so it's totally legal

317
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:31,338
what's the situation I mean Switzerland

318
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:34,279
is obviously kind of unique and kind of

319
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:37,400
leading the pack in that front what's

320
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:39,789
the situation with CBD in Germany so

321
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:44,230
sadly the CBD flowers themselves are

322
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:48,559
forbidden but about all other products

323
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:50,870
there are go and it looks good and we

324
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:55,009
are happy a lot of our customers are

325
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:58,370
real pharmacies and proving the legal

326
00:14:55,009 --> 00:15:01,600
market and the legal aspects it's a huge

327
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:04,669
market and just in this moment the big

328
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,930
retail chains are coming

329
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:12,229
you know eleven seven in Germany it's

330
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:15,049
called Riva Kaufland cheapo and they are

331
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:17,389
now asking for CPT product what what of

332
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:20,179
course means a total different target

333
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:22,759
groups which we with our possibilities

334
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:25,879
we never would have reached or we would

335
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:29,059
have need another 20 years to to tell

336
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:31,039
everybody yeah and we were also talking

337
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:33,619
about different concentrates and things

338
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:35,329
like that and so for myself I I you know

339
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,129
I'm paste in PC now but I grew up in

340
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,990
eastern Canada and in eastern Canada

341
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:41,659
there was a lot of ties to Lebanon and

342
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:43,190
Morocco and we smoked hash that's what

343
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:44,838
we smoked and that's all we got for a

344
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:49,070
very long time until I moved to be see

345
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:50,630
basically Germany and and Switzerland

346
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,540
what are the hash mark it's like one of

347
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:54,860
the concentrate markets like is it is it

348
00:15:52,539 --> 00:15:57,379
sophisticated at all is it not something

349
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,430
people are really interested in then

350
00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:00,559
we'll start with you

351
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:02,899
they are and it strange um we are

352
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:05,569
allowed to grow the the weed up to 1%

353
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:07,789
THC but we are not allowed to make hash

354
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:10,430
with it because there is still one

355
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:13,639
sentence in the law who says hash is

356
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:16,250
forbidden at all like a hard drug stuff

357
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,659
like that but it's quite a nice hash

358
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,450
available everywhere over Switzerland

359
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:23,329
we're close to Morocco and as well the

360
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:24,860
ways from Nepal and Lebanon there it's

361
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:27,050
coming to Switzerland but we are not

362
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:33,470
allowed to produce it by ourselves right

363
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:37,569
now in Germany there is of course also a

364
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:42,500
gray market for extract distillates and

365
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:45,290
the situation especially for CBD ash is

366
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:50,330
looking a little bit better than cpt

367
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:53,809
flowers still still my lawyer says

368
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:58,250
better better don't try because it's it

369
00:16:53,809 --> 00:17:00,679
might provoke 8 the prosecutor to visit

370
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:03,139
you yes

371
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:05,088
some things may might be little but

372
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:07,549
still you have to find a compromise with

373
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:11,708
your neighbors and with with the society

374
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:15,109
around you if they if even if everything

375
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:17,089
concerning CBD is little might be they

376
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:22,369
will find something in account

377
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:24,648
most of shops I have seen broken and did

378
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:27,229
not probe because of the legal laws

379
00:17:24,648 --> 00:17:29,748
about cannabis but because of the very

380
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:37,659
normal business reasons cash flow

381
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:41,269
management liquid is scale of employees

382
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:43,129
and things like this and not because the

383
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:45,798
procedure computer came but better

384
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:49,069
better not to provoke eight the police

385
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:51,259
so so still there is a market but I

386
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:53,269
don't believe it will become that big

387
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:55,700
like in the u.s. I was here in the

388
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:58,868
dispensary and the guy told me have

389
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:02,899
fifty percent of what we're selling is

390
00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:05,599
is something to vaporize and not the

391
00:18:02,898 --> 00:18:08,868
flower and I don't believe this market

392
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:12,378
will be that big in Europe but might be

393
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:13,788
just a question of generation yeah I

394
00:18:12,378 --> 00:18:16,878
mean we've seen the same thing in Canada

395
00:18:13,788 --> 00:18:19,038
too and you know legally you can get

396
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:21,558
hash if you make it yourself you're

397
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,999
technically allowed to do that but

398
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:25,220
that's literally the only way you can do

399
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:27,230
it you can't buy it for a little while

400
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:30,019
somebody it's sort of they sort of

401
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,878
tricked Health Canada they kind of said

402
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:33,980
you know oh no this this Keef is just

403
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:35,388
dried cannabis that's all it is and so

404
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,798
then we're actually allowed to sell it

405
00:18:35,388 --> 00:18:38,719
but I think it only lasted like a week

406
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:43,038
or so and then Health Canada wait wait a

407
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,868
minute and then stop this I have I have

408
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,210
to tell the story because nobody

409
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:49,579
believes but it's true

410
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:54,259
Germany of course also regulated yes so

411
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:59,359
if your doctor tells not to smoke the or

412
00:18:54,259 --> 00:19:03,829
vaporize the pure the CBD flowers

413
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:06,589
THC flowers he can write on the

414
00:19:03,829 --> 00:19:09,710
prescription that the pharmacologist

415
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:11,569
will prepare it for your consumption so

416
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:16,369
he can make out hush of it or test

417
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:19,220
delayed and yes he kept paid for making

418
00:19:16,368 --> 00:19:21,439
you like the doctors are told you have

419
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,659
to inhale it or to eat it or whatever

420
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,899
and this is a crazy thing so if you

421
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:29,540
really want good hush then pass wait you

422
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:33,529
talk to that you need you prefer to

423
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:35,839
to consume hushed and flowers and yeah

424
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:39,109
and might be even their house insurance

425
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:40,279
will pay well and you know I think one

426
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:44,629
of the things that's really interesting

427
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:47,769
to and this is a you know Switzerland

428
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:50,900
you chose CBD joints to replace smoking

429
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:53,029
whenever I go to Europe I can't I can't

430
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,070
really take a joint from people as it

431
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:56,450
was passing around the circle I'm no

432
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:58,759
thanks you know unless I know the

433
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,769
person's Canadian or American because

434
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:02,960
it's all mixed with tobacco which is

435
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:04,670
something that you know that was one of

436
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,640
the reasons why we like when we don't

437
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:09,890
have to smoke ash we like cash in Canada

438
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,890
a lot but you know most of us I think

439
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:14,980
prefer just the flower particularly

440
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:18,170
because we never mix it with any tobacco

441
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:19,789
do you see that sort of custom changing

442
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:21,440
or is that just like super ingrained

443
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:24,799
into the way that people smoke cannabis

444
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,710
in Europe I think it will change right

445
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,750
now it's a most people smoked with

446
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,519
tobacco for sure but with the CBD you

447
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:34,430
are allowed as well now to sell CBD

448
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:37,039
joints so people start to smoke it pure

449
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:39,049
people start to wait and if I have a

450
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,509
look to the United States and probably

451
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:44,210
to Canada as well all although the way

452
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:46,279
saying depends everything like that I

453
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,799
think it will come over Europe as well

454
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:51,470
and Swiss people and row people will

455
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,960
start to smoke weapons as well yeah I

456
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:55,309
think so too I mean III do have a

457
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,930
concern about that when it comes to

458
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:58,549
medical patients for example because

459
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:02,600
vaping there's certain compounds that it

460
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:04,909
just it won't get and the concern is is

461
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:07,219
not actually the vaping it's the idea

462
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:09,590
that oh vaping is okay and anything else

463
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,930
is not okay and that's not really what

464
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:14,899
we've seen and again in particular for

465
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:17,720
certain conditions you can't do that in

466
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:20,840
again in Canada you know most of until

467
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:23,600
we had legalization come in which is not

468
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:26,179
necessarily as nice as it sounds

469
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:28,219
until we had that point the government

470
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:30,560
was fighting every step of the ways and

471
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,150
no you can't grow more than one plant

472
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,319
okay no you can't grow more than to plan

473
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,509
okay you can't grow more than three and

474
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:38,629
this was like years of court cases in

475
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:40,940
between we won the right for medical

476
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:43,110
patients to have access to edibles when

477
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:47,100
Health Canada finally allowed it it was

478
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:49,019
an oil that's capped at such a low point

479
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:52,139
that it's almost not even a concentrate

480
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:54,058
anymore do you do you see regulation in

481
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,220
Europe being maybe a little bit more

482
00:21:54,058 --> 00:21:58,230
sensible than that or how much is

483
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:01,079
Canada's regulations and approach

484
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:02,849
influencing what what German and Swiss

485
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:07,769
and and other European governments are

486
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:10,259
doing probably probably alone because I

487
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:12,710
think we will we will never or I can't

488
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:16,589
imagine that we will be allowed to sell

489
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:18,509
THC calm beers green and red and blue in

490
00:22:16,589 --> 00:22:20,459
Switzerland I don't think so

491
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:22,950
as I know my country and my government

492
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:25,950
so I think it will be strictly regulated

493
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,960
with especially with edibles and stuff

494
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:30,150
like that

495
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:34,069
so our proposed edible rules came out

496
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:40,410
and it's ten milligrams per package

497
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:44,428
which is ridiculous I know it's it's a

498
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:47,130
little bit of a cultural question when I

499
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:49,890
was young I travelled to Amsterdam and I

500
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:54,059
learned a lot about cannabis to smoke it

501
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:57,259
with tobacco sadly sadly but that's a

502
00:22:54,058 --> 00:23:01,379
typical European way and it's it's

503
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:05,400
changing its changing because more

504
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:09,270
cannabis is accessible you can afford to

505
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:11,580
have a own joint this was like one yeah

506
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:12,990
you don't share anymore everybody has

507
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:14,909
one that's a thing I've noticed about

508
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,769
Berlin is everybody has their own joint

509
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:18,150
where maybe in the States or Canada you

510
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:20,639
stand in a circle pass around Berlin

511
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:24,840
everybody has their own blend like - 75

512
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:28,590
% - back at 25% - this is that it's very

513
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:31,319
interesting exactly and and then we

514
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:32,589
learned also in Amsterdam that cookies

515
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:37,289
and

516
00:23:32,589 --> 00:23:40,899
and pralines spacecake it's hard drug

517
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:43,359
you're you can buy it somewhere but

518
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:47,110
don't use it too often better with

519
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:49,869
somebody who is experienced there are

520
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:51,759
some there is also some demand we have

521
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:55,269
also some friends which have on a

522
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:57,789
prescription 30 or 40 grams per day how

523
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:59,889
to consume without using edibles you

524
00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:04,559
have to cook with it you have to eat it

525
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:08,080
and no other way suppositories

526
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,789
suppositories it's a very effective

527
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:13,179
medicinal treatment for a lot of people

528
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:14,769
and it doesn't get you as high on the

529
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,630
THC because it doesn't necessarily go

530
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:19,329
through the liver just go 30 grams a day

531
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:23,010
though is a lot of suppositories it's

532
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:26,139
also if you're crossing the border yeah

533
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:28,150
we have always regulated we have a nice

534
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,950
formula for crossing all the borders I

535
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:34,660
can go also to Switzerland with my

536
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:39,390
German cannabis and but many people try

537
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:41,980
to to put it into the normal diet and

538
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:45,340
for other people it is it could be

539
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:47,890
really dangerous this these doses of

540
00:24:45,339 --> 00:24:50,829
course we have to learn because we what

541
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:52,810
we learn is or what our politician could

542
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:55,659
learn when you when you have legalized

543
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:57,909
you are just starting to legalize you're

544
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:00,160
coming to a certain point and then you

545
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:03,400
see new question well what is going on

546
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,980
and each society has to solve it for it

547
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:09,310
also we are learning from from Canada

548
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:12,339
and and also from California and on the

549
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:14,460
other side we have our own system and we

550
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:16,389
have to make our neighbors happy as well

551
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,370
so I don't think we're gonna have time

552
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:20,410
for question we got time for one well

553
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:23,799
I've had one more for them actually in

554
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:30,550
terms of okay Europe who's who's next I

555
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:33,369
mean so so Canada is the first g7

556
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:35,019
country to legalize cannabis Uruguay was

557
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:37,299
the first country in the Americas to

558
00:25:35,019 --> 00:25:41,139
legalize cannabis so who's going to be

559
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:42,399
first in Europe probably looks and work

560
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,259
they made an announcement to the

561
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,130
government of Luxembourg that they will

562
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:47,920
legal

563
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:49,360
medical and recreational but when it

564
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,150
will happen we don't know actually you

565
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:54,879
can play bingo with Europe I seek your

566
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:57,220
chances for Switzerland we have now two

567
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,860
important things on the way in our

568
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:03,100
government one is the easy way for

569
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:06,399
medical use and the other one is like a

570
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:10,179
pilot project to get your wheat in the

571
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:12,190
drugstore both projects are on the way

572
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:17,980
to come in the next 1 to 3 years

573
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:19,870
and yeah I hope for Switzerland I hope

574
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:22,750
also of course for Switzerland I hope

575
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:25,869
for Switzerland as well thank you well

576
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:27,099
be in Zurich in May right international

577
00:26:25,869 --> 00:26:29,039
cannabis business conference there you

578
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:32,139
go one quick question then we got a move

579
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:35,259
thank you thank you real quick Ben my

580
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:36,490
mom Swiss just Mazurek Switzerland

581
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:38,109
always been very progressive with

582
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,730
addressing the drug problem with heroin

583
00:26:38,109 --> 00:26:41,949
problem but this is questions for

584
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:44,170
Germany as well our both country are

585
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:47,200
your countries using that as an

586
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:50,320
alternative to you know to sell to

587
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,900
market cannabis as an alternative to the

588
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:58,990
opioids as well as heroin and addressing

589
00:26:52,900 --> 00:27:01,660
it that way you can you need the right

590
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:04,329
doctor in this moment we still have a

591
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:09,070
big lack of doctors which prescribing

592
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:11,889
and dare to do it we have might be to

593
00:27:09,069 --> 00:27:13,659
thousands for Germany and you need one

594
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:18,960
doctor who over takes the responsibility

595
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:18,960
and start doing exactly this and

596
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:25,299
singular singular cases unknown but I

597
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:29,199
don't know any doctor who is specialized

598
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:30,940
on this in Canada we do have a lot of

599
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,830
doctors that specialize in it

600
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,539
unfortunately our regulators are going

601
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:36,669
the opposite direction and making it

602
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:38,470
very difficult to do that particularly

603
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:40,180
Vancouver one of the reasons why they

604
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:43,299
legalized dispensaries before it was

605
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:46,299
legal in Canada was specifically because

606
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:49,509
of the very serious opiate problem that

607
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:51,129
that BC is facing and and it's been the

608
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:53,529
opposite we've made it harder for people

609
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:55,000
to access we've you know our got our

610
00:27:53,529 --> 00:27:56,690
provincial governments are now spending

611
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,640
a lot of money on it

612
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:00,080
campaigns around cannabis still not

613
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,190
saying a word about opiates you know

614
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:04,879
they're still shoveling those down

615
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:07,130
people's throats so it's it's we went

616
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,110
the opposite way of the way we should

617
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:10,850
have gone in and and we see that a

618
00:28:09,109 --> 00:28:13,490
little bit here in California as well

619
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:15,019
you know the Bay Area when when Berkeley

620
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:17,210
in San Francisco started regulating

621
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:20,329
their own dispensaries they cared about

622
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:22,009
the health service the health component

623
00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:23,720
of it and who was actually getting

624
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:26,000
access to it and whether it was covered

625
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,410
and subsidized a little bit and then as

626
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,970
soon as you start having the state

627
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:30,650
regulated that kind of goes by the

628
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:32,900
wayside and then when you have the

629
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:34,720
federal government regulate it more will

630
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:37,009
go by the wayside in it and it

631
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,110
unfortunately seems to be the pattern I

632
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:41,240
think the only kind of hope is that once

633
00:28:39,109 --> 00:28:43,189
it's legal we can get research done on

634
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,710
it that makes it harder and harder to

635
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:47,000
stop to stop those things from happening

636
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:48,680
and stop those types of programs from

637
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,240
being put in place great thank you so

638
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,269
very much let's hear it again for our

639
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,809
panelists I was very enlightening and

640
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:55,809
fantastic
