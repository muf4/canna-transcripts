00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:07,438
understand what this industry requires

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,159
and what this industry could look like

21
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,719
if we all sort of got behind and and

22
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,320
pushed it through the way it needs to be

23
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:17,640
pushed through very different from shows

24

00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:40,959
many of us to gather uh and it is truly

33

the conversations that happen at ICBC

34
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,589
