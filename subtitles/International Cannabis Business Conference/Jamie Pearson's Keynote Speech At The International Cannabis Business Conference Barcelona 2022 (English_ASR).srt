and now randall how are we doing on the

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,640
powerpoint there we go

60
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,039
what i'm going to talk about today

61
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,359
are the top 10 things investors

62
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:32,159
operators and consumers should

63
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,239
anticipate as legalization spreads

64
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,359
across europe

65
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,759
and

66
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,760
the reason i think this is an important

67
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,639
com conversation for us to have right

68
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,759
now

69
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,399
is that

70
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,959
on both continents uh united north

71
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,039
america well in all continents actually

72
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,840
south america also in europe

73
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:54,719
legalization is spreading

74
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,800
like wildfire i had a dinner last night

75
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,519
and there was a consultant nathan he's

76
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,640
in the audience he said 55 countries

77
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,080
right now

78
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,439
are looking at some form of legalization

79
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,440
and there's some

80
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:11,039
suspicion that most of europe will

81
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,239
probably follow the canadian regulations

82
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,400
when

83
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,840
when it goes wreck

84
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,560
and that's okay what i'm going to talk

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,080
about really handles both

86
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,080
canada and the us

87
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,120
it's a historic time it's been a bumpy

88
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,479
ride and one of the things that we have

89
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,319
to rely on

90
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,318
are is history

91
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:35,280
so we had prohibition in the united

92
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:35,280
states and alcohol

93
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,598
and it's a really interesting

94
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,120
idea when you look at

95
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,479
the fact that

96
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,200
i took this right off the history

97
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,598
channel and this is where within minutes

98
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,399
of utah so utah was the last state that

99
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:52,079
had to ratify the pro get rid of the

100
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,319
prohibition of alcohol

101
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,640
and within minutes

102
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,839
you can see liquor was flowing delivery

103
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,199
trucks were

104
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,360
filled with beer

105
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,839
and everybody was ready to go

106
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,480
so i'm always asking myself how is that

107
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,039
possible that within minutes of the end

108
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,280
of legalization everybody was ready to

109
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:13,519
start drinking alcohol again well we're

110
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,280
doing that now in cannabis because we've

111
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,199
got these medical programs we've got

112
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,600
decriminalization

113
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,560
we've got medical marijuana in lots of

114
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,439
places so the reality here is that we're

115
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,079
ready for this to

116
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:31,519
to happen again this is really clunky

117
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:33,279
i'm sorry you guys um okay so i want to

118
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,599
tell you that

119
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,679
this story really begins with roots and

120
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,400
suits

121
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,959
roots are the people that

122
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:46,319
risked life and liberty to keep cannabis

123
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:48,319
alive during prohibition worldwide we

124
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,319
call them roots how many of you in here

125
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,079
consider yourself a root

126
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,839
i've got a few of you

127
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,599
thank you

128
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,039
and then we have the suits i consider

129
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,040
myself a suit

130
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,639
i was a real estate investor for 25

131
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,680
years

132
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,918
i didn't jump into the industry until it

133
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,680
was safe and legal

134
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,959
and a lot of the suits came in now that

135
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,000
we have a bona fide industry and they're

136
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,000
here to make money

137
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,600
my dad's a root

138
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:23,279
my dad's been growing cannabis for 56

139
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:26,960
years since 1966 i think is the math i'm

140
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,799
52. so i've literally grown up

141
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:32,239
in and that's my daughter's hand by the

142
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,199
way on one of my dad's plants

143
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,400
we've all grown up in my family

144
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,400
harvest

145
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,638
is a thing we have a harvest party

146
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,799
everybody sits and trims weed when i was

147
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,000
a kid i had a choice do i pick up dog

148
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,639
poop or do i uh trim weed for me it was

149
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,879
easy i picked up dog poop because i

150
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,199
really wasn't a fan of cannabis

151
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,759
and um and i hate trimming and i still

152
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,439
hate trimming um

153
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,720
for all you roots out there or maybe

154
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,719
some of you suits you know what i'm

155
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,600
talking about

156
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,000
so i had a root background but i still

157
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,439
don't consider myself a root route

158
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,959
because i didn't choose to go into

159
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,800
cannabis until it was

160
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,159
legal and safe

161
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,520
and plus i had all of the real estate

162
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,520
holdings and things that i didn't want

163
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,799
to put at risk the other thing i had

164
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,959
going for me i think i'm just going to

165
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,759
give up the give up the ipad and just

166
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,599

so

172
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,879
muggs and i

173
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:37,359
invested in real estate together

174
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,639
and when it was time for cyprus to do a

175
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,199
weed deal

176
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,280
he came to me and said would you help us

177
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,520
find a weed deal because he had

178
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,599
experience with me doing business

179
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,598
because i'm a suit

180
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,280
he was more comfortable having me go out

181
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:53,399
and make sure that the band had a good

182
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:56,478
deal so in

183
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:58,478
2015 i found bang

184
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:59,839
cypress did a deal with bang and i've

185
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:01,839
been with bang ever since so it's about

186
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,478
seven years

187
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,959

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,120
we'll go back

236
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,959
anybody else

237
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,600
and they're all over the auditorium so

238
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,599
you guys can

239
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,559
you can scan later

240
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:10,480
this is the current map of the united

241
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:12,239
states of legalization so 18 states are

242
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,278
adult use

243
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,120
31 are medical seven are cbd only two

244
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:18,480
have decriminalized and the four orange

245
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,959
states are the weird ones that have

246
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,200
actually gone so far as to outlaw

247
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:26,239
cannabis so it will take federal

248
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,879
legalization to get

249
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,039
those four states on board although i

250
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,120
have seen that a couple of them have

251
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,719
some ballot language

252
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,320
coming up

253
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,519
i want you to pay particular attention

254
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,680
to idaho and wyoming up there

255
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,159
surrounded by washington oregon and

256
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:47,278
montana the citizens of those states

257
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:49,919
just have to cross a border in wyoming

258
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,200
when montana went wreck on january 1st

259
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:54,079
of this year

260
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,160
85 percent of the transactions

261
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,759
in the southern part of montana were

262
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,120
wyoming residents because we have to

263
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,000
track them

264
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,278
people want cannabis

265
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,759
this is clear

266
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:08,799
and legalization has been sweeping the

267
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,639
united states since 1996 that's when

268
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:13,039
california went medical

269
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:16,319
when i jumped into the industry in 2014

270
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:18,078
there were four wreck states in 2015

271
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,278
four more went wreck and that was the

272
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:20,719
year that everyone considered the

273
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:22,639
tipping point

274
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,639
what we're seeing in europe is malta

275
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,319
went wreck germany signal that's going

276
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,919
wreck and you're starting to see the

277
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,720
same thing but you have the benefit of

278
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,719
this

279
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,560
as your playbook and i'm going to talk

280
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,320
to you about the things that you need to

281
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,319
know

282
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,839
so that you can educate the people in

283
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,278
your communities to not repeat the

284
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,680
mistakes that

285
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:44,240
the really swimming upstream hard row we

286
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,239
had to hold

287
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,360
the one thing i'll tell you is when you

288
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,959
have

289
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,879
46 states with some form of legalization

290
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,639
clarence thomas our supreme court

291
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,320
justice the most conservative supreme

292
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,480
court justice we have

293
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,399
this is his quote

294
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,680
this was a dissenting opinion about

295
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,440
cannabis and he is basically saying

296
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,479
you can't have it both ways federal

297
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,040
government you can't look the other way

298
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,120
and let states have states rights

299
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,719
and then when it comes to the feds you

300
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,159
get to do these cash grabs you get to

301
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,240
raid people you get to take their money

302
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,919
you get to take their equipment at some

303
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,879
point there's going to be a lawsuit

304
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:27,039
that'll get to the supreme court or

305
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,399
they'll pass safe banking congress will

306
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,838
pass it or there'll be some sort of a

307
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,600
vote but we are in the process of

308
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,360
we in the industry of

309
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,440
this balancing act of waiting for

310
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,440
legalization federal legalization

311
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,000
so here are some of the things that we

312
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,720
have seen i'm calling them expectations

313
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,919
things that you can expect are coming as

314
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,000
we legalize cannabis

315
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,719
number one there's competing interests

316
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,879
so we have consumers and the authorities

317
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,959
people want it

318
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:01,039
the authorities are scared your

319
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,759
governments are afraid

320
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:06,000
and medical people are afraid they don't

321
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:09,439
doctors don't learn about cannabis so

322
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,919
imagine in the us 44 states amer in

323
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,320
america wake up with some form of legal

324
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:17,360
cannabinoid

325
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,680
we don't know anything about the cross

326
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,120
indications of drugs interactions i mean

327
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,199
i can't say we don't know anything

328
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,480
thanks to ralph michonne and people in

329
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,320
israel and people in canada were

330
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,800
starting to learn more and more but we

331
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,639
have so much to learn about what

332
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,879
cannabinoids can do

333
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,278
people want it they are using it they

334
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,519
never stopped using it and it's time for

335
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:40,159
all of us to get the government and the

336
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,480
medical professionals on board

337
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,319
because it's it's better for us it's

338
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,120
safer for us here's some more competing

339
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,040
interests the roots in the suits

340
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,519
the roots want a seat at the table and

341
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:53,199
they deserve a seat at the table

342
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,799
it's not necessarily that the suits

343
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,920
don't want them but there are a lot of

344
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:59,838
assumptions people make the roots assume

345
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,759
that the suits are just doing cash grab

346
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,600
but i'm going to tell you the suits that

347
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,600
are in right now

348
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,519
have left some cushy jobs i know some

349
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,399
people that left pepsi they left

350
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,240
constellation brands they left kellogg's

351
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,679
to jump into an industry that is not

352
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,399
quite legal yet

353
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,759
so

354
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,159
my guess is

355
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,799
they're a little edgy

356
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,480
or they're cannabis fans and they see

357
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,000
this industry going somewhere and they

358
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,879
know that cannabis makes people feel

359
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,159
better so you have the suits jumping in

360
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,720
and they're a little

361
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,719
edgy in the roots deciding that oh

362
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,800
they don't know anything about cannabis

363
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,200
we have to teach them everything and

364
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,559
then you have the suits assuming that

365
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,399
everyone in cannabis is a bunch of

366
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,000
stoners they don't know what they're

367
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,240
doing we're going to have to teach them

368
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,919
about kpis and we're going to teach them

369
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,278
how to do business

370
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:52,399
but the reality is i have a guy on my

371
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:54,559
team that did a 13 years in prison and

372
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,440
11 years of that was in solitary

373
00:13:54,559 --> 00:14:00,479
confinement he still he ran his cannabis

374
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,839
business from solitary confinement

375
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,600
i'm not going to teach that guy much

376
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,639
about running a business he's got a lot

377
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,560
to teach me right so we all have to stop

378
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,159
making assumptions

379
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:14,159
and finally federal state and local

380
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,958
authorities have

381
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,958
competing interests everybody wants that

382
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,239
tax dollar and everybody wants that

383
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,559
glory

384
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,879
but none of them want to take the risk

385
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:27,679
of doing something unpopular and it's

386
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:31,838
our job to educate them that this is

387
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,838
popular we want this

388
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,279
this is not unique to america

389
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:43,518
there's been a drug war across the globe

390
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,759
and it's not been a war on drugs it's

391
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,278
been a war on race and let's be very

392
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,439
clear

393
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,600
there is no difference and this is

394
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,279
statistically proven and i will tell you

395
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,360
you can look it up

396
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:58,559
white people black people and brown

397
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,959
people use cannabis at the same rate

398
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,439
but black and brown people are four

399
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,759
times more likely to be arrested for

400
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,360
cannabis use there are forty thousand

401
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:08,799
black and brown people sitting in prison

402
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,560
in america

403
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,719
those are the roots that have given

404
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:15,759
their life and their liberty for all of

405
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,800
us to be here with an industry

406
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:21,600
social equity is a conversation that

407
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:23,759
needs to be had

408
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,759
and the roots should have a seat at the

409
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,399
table and social equity is the right

410
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,319
thing to do it is a moral imperative

411
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,480
and what i would challenge all of you

412
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,959
and what we do at bang is we give a

413
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,120
portion of our profits every month to

414
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,758
the last prisoner project to get some of

415
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,759
these people all of them out of prison

416
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,440
there should be nobody in prison for

417
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,839
possession of a plant that grows in

418
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,839
nature

419
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,679
while we're out making millions of

420
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,759
dollars and so i'm saying to you and i'm

421
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:55,838
challenging each one of you

422
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,839
incorporate that into your business plan

423
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,120
consumer demand is always grossly

424
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,880
underestimated

425
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,278
and what happens then is the

426
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,958
governmental authorities you can i you

427
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:09,519
can count on this

428
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,599
they underestimate the demand they don't

429
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,159
give enough licenses they want to dip

430
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,560
their toe in the water rather than

431
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:19,519
saying oh let's embrace this plant

432
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,599
everybody wants it it's never gone away

433
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,440
everybody's still using it

434
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,680
i just had a talk with a gentleman out

435
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,959
in the in the foyer cliff who said oh

436
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,679
south africa's got a big a big market

437
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,518
well

438
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,599
we all do

439
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,919
america has a big illicit market canada

440
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,839
had a big illicit market south american

441
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:40,559
countries had big illicit markets

442
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,759
europe's had a big illicit market

443
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:43,758
cannabis never went away

444
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:48,559
and if they don't put a lot of licenses

445
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,480
at every level of the supply chain

446
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,239
you're going to end up with bottlenecks

447
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,600
and what we've seen across the united

448
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,159
states is the bottlenecks happen

449
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,519
wherever there aren't enough licenses

450
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:58,399
and now i'm going to tell you how it

451
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,000
works

452
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,759
you're going to have dispensaries in

453
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,679
some form or fashion

454
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,199
the recreational cannabis will get to

455
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:07,918
the consumer

456
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,679
and then they're going to say omg we

457
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,919
didn't do this right and they run out of

458
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,600
product it's not happened differently

459
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,439
anywhere in the us

460
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,038
every single state that went wreck

461
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,279
underestimated the amount of product

462
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,480
they were going to need

463
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,279
and then

464
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,439
the legislators go oh tax dollars

465
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,359
awesome we're going to meet demand and

466
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,600
then they open up cultivation and then

467
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,519
cultivation explodes

468
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,480
and then what happens we end up with a

469
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:34,319
glut

470
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,599
so i'm thinking specifically about

471
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,839
canada

472
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:40,079
i'm thinking about oregon

473
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,678
these places where there's a glut of

474
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,199
supply now because

475
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,240
cultivation exploded because they

476
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,160
realized they didn't have enough

477
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,000
cannabis to meet demand and that's when

478
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,160
the market speaks because eventually the

479
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,919
good operators operate or the people

480
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,919
that have deep pockets

481
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,320
and the operators that aren't so good

482
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,120
don't make it

483
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:01,119
takes about three years

484
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:04,159
depending on the government it can take

485
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:06,239
longer minimum three years you'll start

486
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,400
to see the supply chain normalized these

487
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,720
are things that you can expect

488
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,919
because they're going to underestimate

489
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,240
the demand

490
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,400
and in europe i think they're v

491
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,798
the numbers i'm seeing come out in some

492
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,000
of these trade publications prohibition

493
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:25,440
partners and uh leafly

494
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,480
they are way underestimating the demand

495
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,720
i think you guys are going to be

496
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,200
surprised at how big the european market

497
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,960
is going to end up being

498
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,200
expectation number four

499
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,720
the bottlenecks will be local this

500
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,480
always happens

501
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,038
because when we talk about the federal

502
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,640
and state and local legislators it won't

503
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,480
be the european union that's going to

504
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,360
screw up cannabis it's going to be the

505
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,000
school board in stuttgart or some

506
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,839
little town that's going to go

507
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,319
not in my backyard

508
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:56,319
that's nimby i didn't i didn't coin that

509
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,960
but we used that in cannabis in america

510
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:01,119
a lot the nimby effect not in my

511
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,600
backyard so everybody's like hang on a

512
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,759
second we want this but why don't you do

513
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:06,798
it and we'll watch and we'll see what

514
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,798
happens

515
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:09,798
and

516
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,879
is where you guys come in you have to

517
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,679
teach the people at the local level

518
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,720
that everybody wants this plant it is

519
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:23,440
safe nobody dies from it

520
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,720
we always see the media talking about oh

521
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,279
in america

522
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,759
oh halloween candy there's people giving

523
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,038
the hell you know medicated candy to

524
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:32,960
children

525
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:35,119
and i always laugh and usually go on

526
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,160
record and say a bang chocolate bar

527
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:40,959
costs 20 dollars believe me nobody's

528
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,558
buying a 20 chocolate bar and forgetting

529
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,360
and handing it to some

530
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,720
child on a trick-or-treating expedition

531
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:48,639
doesn't happen

532
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,079
and every year they're just

533
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,240
peddling fear

534
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:54,639
we have to keep the media from peddling

535
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,880
fear and start peddling solutions

536
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,200
and we have to stop

537
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:03,360
really buying into it we have to start

538
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:06,400
educating about things like

539
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:08,719
when cannabis is legal

540
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,840
the age of onset

541
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,400
goes up

542
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:15,199
so kids start waiting more and more it's

543
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,640
harder to get cannabis for a kid

544
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,558
when it's legal

545
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,640
kids don't buy beer in the middle school

546
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,558
bathroom but they can buy cannabis in

547
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,919
the middle school bathroom but in states

548
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,720
where it's legal it's really hard for

549
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,960
them to get domestic violence goes down

550
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,880
drunk driving goes down

551
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,279
wellness goes up

552
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,880
our communities at the local level need

553
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,279
to embrace this

554
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,400
not just because there's a tax grab but

555
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:42,240
because

556
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,640
it improves wellness in our communities

557
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,079
fear is the most powerful

558
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,038
force

559
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:51,519
in the fight against prohibition and our

560
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:54,000
job is to fight the stigma so the first

561
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:55,759
two years i was in cannabis i really

562
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,279
didn't want people to know

563
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,200
i was still kind of worried like how is

564
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,200
this going to impact my business

565
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,120
my real estate business

566
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,360
now people say well what do you do i say

567
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,959
i'm in cannabis and then a discussion

568
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,678
ensues

569
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,279
be loud be proud be out let's fight this

570
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,519
fear

571
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:15,759
there is a lot of ignorance about

572
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:18,798
potency about the

573
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:21,200
system about technology

574
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,720
and about the industry in general

575
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,600
people are still talking about indica

576
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,759
and sativa people are thinking that 10

577
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:30,798
milligrams is enough if you have a

578
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:34,240
tolerance 10 milligrams doesn't

579
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:36,158
doesn't affect a lot of people

580
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,159
if you're using cannabis for a medical

581
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,200
reason to sleep or for seizure disorder

582
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,679
or for cancer for nausea a 10 milligram

583
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,360
dose isn't enough and yet that's the

584
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:51,120
dose that most municipalities and states

585
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:51,119
recommend as the starting dose

586
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,038
the media has an aversion to facts and

587
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,520
boy we know this in all areas of the

588
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:02,640
world but we need to educate and demand

589
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,639
better from our media

590
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:07,918
expect a time suck and expect a green

591
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:09,759
tax

592
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,600
so everything's going to cost 10 times

593
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,440
more and everything's going to take 10

594
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,678
times longer why

595
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,240
they will not fund the government

596
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,080
offices with enough people so when the

597
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,759
application for those licenses comes

598
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,119
open they're going to have a stack of

599
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:25,038
licenses

600
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:26,879
it's going to take forever to get them

601
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:28,960
meanwhile you're going to figure out

602
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,799
that you need this particular spot for

603
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,159
your retail shop and you're going to pay

604
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:33,839
rent for months and months and months

605
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,240
while you're waiting for your license

606
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:39,119
does any of this sound familiar to you

607
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,120
this is what happens

608
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,359
it costs 10 times more because

609
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,678
everybody's on a learning curve

610
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:47,199
so you want to get a zoning

611
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,038
consultant to come in and help you

612
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,319
figure out your zoning well guess what

613
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:52,000
the zoning consultant that knows

614
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:52,960
cannabis may not know the rules where

615
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,519
you live

616
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,840
so part of this is

617
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:59,679
understand when you're planning and when

618
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,918
you're making your business plan

619
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,240
expect things to take longer expect

620
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,440
things to be more expensive we are not

621
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,880
in business

622
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,480
we are in prohibition

623
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,000
a lot of companies start and fail

624
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,279
because they underestimate what it's

625
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,519
going to take and how long it's going to

626
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:15,519
take

627
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:21,519
lab testing inconsistencies you can

628
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:25,038
expect them in the u.s and in canada

629
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:27,599
there is very little regulation about

630
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:28,960
how a standard lab is supposed to test

631
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:30,639
cannabis

632
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,640
some of them have different equipment

633
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,400
some of them calibrate differently and

634
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,080
what ends up happening is that you end

635
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,840
up having different results and it can

636
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:40,158
really

637
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:41,759
lab testing has bankrupted companies

638
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,039
because they've

639
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:47,839
put a crop out it didn't test right they

640
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:51,359
gotta destroy it throw it out

641
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:53,119
usually it ends up on the illicit market

642
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:55,759
each step in the supply chain is an

643
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:57,119
opportunity to tax and what happens is

644
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:58,240
they say

645
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:59,759
we're going to we're going to have you

646
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,759
lab test and we're going to tax

647
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,158
cultivation then we're going to lab test

648
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,359
we're going to tax the extracted oil

649
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,520
then we're going to lab test and we're

650
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:09,519
going to tax the manufactured product

651
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:11,440
then we're going to lab test

652
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,278
uh the final product before it goes to

653
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,200
the retail shop and we're going to tax

654
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:18,240
it there too oh and we're going to tax

655
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,558
distribution so now what you have is

656
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,159
because of this lab testing situation

657
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:24,879
because let's be honest you only need

658
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:29,200
one lab test to know that the product is

659
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:31,440
no pesticides no no um mold uh no heavy

660
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,360
metals do we need to test it at every

661
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,000
function at every juncture of the supply

662
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:38,158
chain no but that's usually what happens

663
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,919
and so under the guise of safety

664
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,919
consumers bear the brunt of that cost

665
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:46,240
and then guess what they go back to the

666
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,720
elicit market where the products cheaper

667
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,240
it's not lab tested but

668
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,919
what we're trying to do under the guise

669
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,599
of safety is we're driving people to the

670
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:57,360
product that's probably dirty

671
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:58,879

679
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,559
that if you're building cannabis brands

680
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:18,558
in europe

681
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:19,678
this is where cannabis brands in america

682
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:22,558
are going

683
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:25,120
uh be ready

684
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,879
job creation and tax revenue

685
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:30,479
the u.s cannabis

686
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:33,440
industry created 450 000 jobs

687
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,200
in 2021 last year

688
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,720
in comparison the financial sector

689
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,480
created 145 000 in construction did 165

690
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,400
000. look at that

691
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,558
when you think about

692
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,960
countries like greece

693
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:49,200
that have an ailing ag sector imagine

694
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,880
what the cultivation will do for those

695
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,880
countries and the jobs that are going to

696
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,640
be created in europe

697
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,240
tax revenue numbers are reported from

698
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,320
sales

699
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,319
they're not really reported from all of

700
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,558
the employment tax that comes through

701
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:05,439
all those jobs

702
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:08,399
and the data never counts ancillary that

703
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,440
450 000 jobs those are in the cannabis

704
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,880
industry

705
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,600
but think about the lawyers and the

706
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,919
accountants and the bankers and the um

707
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:16,798
the people that are selling tables and

708
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,240
lights

709
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:21,038
that's also part of the cannabis

710
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,240
industry and those aren't even counted

711
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:26,319
this is a

712
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,319
huge opportunity for governments

713
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,720

725
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,240

726
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,320
you are agreeing to share your data and

727
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,759
everybody's buying it that's how you

728
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,918

729
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,278
mattress on google the next thing you

730
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,960

736
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,960
model in your business plan because the

737
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:20,319
data

738
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,600
is the key to effective marketing

739
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:23,359
because you got to market to people on

740
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,439
their phones people are not going on

741
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,879
their their desktops

742
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,038
and when you think about what's coming

743
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,039

innovator aspirational

746
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,519

747
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,440
when i think about all the people in

748
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:44,240

749

we are not going to be allow fear to let

756

and i'm going to leave you with this

760
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:13,440
quote from eleanor roosevelt when i

761
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,880
landed in barcelona two days ago it was

762
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,720
international women's day and i felt

763
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,640
like this was apropos

764
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,120
you gain strength courage and confidence

765
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,200
by every experience in which you really

766
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:26,398
stop to look fear in the face

767
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,319
and do the thing you think you cannot do

768
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:31,558
we can do this

769
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:31,558
