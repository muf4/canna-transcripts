1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,449
I'm going to talk about therapeutic

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:10,759
potential of acidic cannabinoids and the

3
00:00:08,449 --> 00:00:12,169
cannabis and taraji effect I'll start

4
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:14,359
out with this statement first of all

5
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:16,599
that without cannabis plant and the war

6
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:18,608
on drugs we would not know about

7
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:21,769
endocannabinoid system

8
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:25,310
because the war on drugs and the idea of

9
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:27,800
sponsoring cannabis research that shows

10
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:29,629
that cannabis is harmful letters to the

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,820
discovery of the endocannabinoid system

12
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:33,140
and

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,878
without war on drugs we would not

14
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,239
witness the end of cannabis prohibition

15
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:40,129
either so it was in a way of

16
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:43,009
self-destructing war on drugs that is

17
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,870
now ending the second statement if it

18
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:47,149
were not for the endocannabinoid system

19
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:49,009
we would not be gathered here at all we

20
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:51,500
would not be interested in knowing the

21
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:54,109
relationship between our body and the

22
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,759
cannabis plant and I'm going to move on

23
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:58,460
to the city cannabinoids now this is

24
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:02,390
from Lithuania where we grow our hemp

25
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:04,670
wild organic where when I go I'd like to

26
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,219
pitch a tent there for about 23 days and

27
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,920
go nowhere else

28
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:11,719
we inspect our plans here and this is

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,310
from about I think three weeks ago it

30
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:15,438
was the beginning of September actually

31
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,510
so about four weeks ago about three

32
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,728
weeks before we harvested those plants

33
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,890
that were about 16 feet tall at that

34
00:01:19,728 --> 00:01:23,509
time

35
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:25,849
hi my name is Kelly I'm really

36
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:28,430
interested in the neuroprotective in

37
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:31,009
capabilities of cannabinoids and I'd

38
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:34,130
like to know your thoughts on the acidic

39
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:37,579
or the natural versions of THC acid and

40
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:41,478
CBD acid for ya do you think they're

41
00:01:37,578 --> 00:01:43,188
more effective and for treating things

42
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:45,920
like dementia and neurodegenerative

43
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:47,839
diseases like Alzheimer's or and Ann

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,280
dolls and secondly you know are there

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,990
any trials going on because there's lots

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,868
of anecdotal evidence about this stuff

47
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:55,489
and I'd like to hear more

48
00:01:52,868 --> 00:01:59,450
it's a great question neuroprotective

49
00:01:55,489 --> 00:02:01,218
effects of cannabinoids is you let's

50
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,719
start with the US government owning the

51
00:02:01,218 --> 00:02:05,408
patent on cannabinoids was

52
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:05,408
neuroprotective

53
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:13,489
there is evidence and there is evidence

54
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,650
mostly for neutral cannabinoids THC and

55
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:17,420
CBD

56
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:20,060
there's evidence and all time disease

57
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:22,369
reduction of beta-amyloid plaques and

58
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,650
senile plaques in the brain so far it's

59
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,659
in in in vitro studies so have not been

60
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:30,230
done in humans in vivo and we should

61
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:32,750
look into apart from one Parkinson's

62
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:34,489
study in vitro there's nothing on the

63
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,680
city cannabinoids it relates to

64
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,330
neuroprotection when we think of

65
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,170
neuroprotection we have to think about

66
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:44,120
things like inflammation the brain when

67
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:46,219
the brain is on flames things are not

68
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,439
good when the brain is inflamed its

69
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:52,069
associated with epilepsy its associated

70
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:53,870
with dementia and so controlling these

71
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:55,909
processes that we know it controls

72
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:59,060
inflammation is very likely is what's

73
00:02:55,909 --> 00:03:02,960
also contributing to neuroprotection now

74
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:06,020
if we look at human studies to my

75
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:10,250
knowledge they're very limited to survey

76
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:13,010
studies and I just learned that I think

77
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,930
tiller is doing a PTSD study so I think

78
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:16,759
that's also important to see what

79
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,650
results are going to come from from that

80
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:20,959
so it's a little bit of hand waving

81
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,879
about neuroprotection we don't exactly

82
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,310
know how it works we know that controls

83
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,859
the balances neuronal activity its

84
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,819
anti-inflammatory and those could be the

85
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,540
things that contribute to

86
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:31,539
neuroprotection
