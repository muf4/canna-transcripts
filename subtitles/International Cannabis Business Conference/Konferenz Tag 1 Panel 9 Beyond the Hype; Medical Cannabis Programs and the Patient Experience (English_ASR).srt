1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
we have a topic that I consider to be

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,980
very very important especially in the

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,199
stage of the development of the medical

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,240
cannabis Market here in Europe right now

5
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:14,459
of course A lot of people are looking at

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,839
what's going to happen with Rec and you

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,539
know how the Market's going to evolve

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,199
but we're here to talk about the medical

9
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,400
market and the patient experience and I

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,960
think that we can't forget that with

11
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:26,459
everything that's going on

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,859
so without further Ado I'm going to

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,000
start by just giving a little intro of

14
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:35,160

joining us out of the GTA at the greater

26
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:09,060
Toronto area and last but not least at

27
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:12,059
the end we have Dr jean-clan shikluna

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,099
so I'm just going to get right into it

31
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:24,478
gentlemen I would like to know what can

32
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:26,039
we do right now to improve the access to

33
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,319
medical cannabis for patients and

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,118
improve the patient Journey what can we

35
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,618
do right now to make things better for

36
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:33,420
them

37
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:35,400
maybe we should start from from left to

38
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,640
right or whatever Direction so we're

39
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,960
focused obviously on Germany and the one

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,759
of the largest televising platforms

41
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:43,078
there and I think it's really it's

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,000
shifting it's shifting towards

43
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:46,978
convenience so it needs to be much

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,319
easier to be a cannabis patient I think

45
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,060
in the past we had an issue of I need to

46
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,219
go to a doctor there then I need to go

47
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,740
to a pharmacy there then then there's an

48
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:58,679
issue I keep going back and forth I

49
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:59,699
think that's not only limiting the I

50
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,799
think it's taking a lot of time for

51
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,140
patients I think it's frustrating for

52
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,420
patients but it's also blocking people

53
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,118
from considering becoming a cannabis

54
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,159
patient so our focus is really invest

55
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,780
heavily in build up in Tech and also the

56
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:14,639
operations in the background and I'm

57
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,979
glad to say that now in Germany which

58
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,019
was unheard of before we have through

59
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:20,639
our Blue Mill group footprint we have

60
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,200
the first patients with video

61
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,719
consultation on their phone on a Monday

62
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:26,399
and less than 24 hours they have the

63
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,878
Cannabis medication in their hand and it

64
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,439
used to be days or not even weeks

65
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:33,359
um I think one of the biggest challenges

66
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,859
right now is that there's no streamlined

67
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,319
regulations nobody understands what a

68
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,420
medical patient is if you went out and

69
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:41,699
talked to 50 people and asked them to

70
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:43,500
describe medical cannabis you will

71
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:46,919
probably get 50 or 60 different opinions

72
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:50,039
on what it is so education has to be a

73
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:53,579
real key figure here uh to to ensure

74
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,859
that our physicians Regulators uh kind

75
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,519
of streamline regulations because

76
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,319
jurisdictionally people don't understand

77
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,780
it within the country people don't

78
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,878
understand it and then the other key is

79
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,580
it's going to be access you know who's

80
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,018
where can I get uh the medicines is it

81
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,879
going to be through a specialist is it

82
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,219
through a regular doctor is it through a

83
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,318
pharmacy do I have to go online and get

84
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:14,878
it so I think education backed by

85
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,219
evidence and science is going to be huge

86
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,259
so that Regulators Physicians can feel

87
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:20,939
comfortable knowing but that education

88
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:22,259
for consumers also is going to be a huge

89
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:24,658
key

90
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:26,340
I love it I'm going to follow up on that

91
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:28,620
as well and really reiterate the

92
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,780
educational aspect of it one of the

93
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,420
first priorities that we did was to

94
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,219
start educating Physicians thankfully we

95
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:37,859
had a very strong network of doctors we

96
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:39,239
worked with in Ontario and one by one we

97
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,700
were able to communicate with them and

98
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,860
showing real patients not Stoners and

99
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:44,598
try and destigmatize cannabis use as a

100
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,159
medicine

101
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:49,259
that type of education was able to kind

102
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:51,780
of lead a pathway for doctors to become

103
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:53,158
more comfortable prescribing a narcotic

104
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,318
that at one point they thought turned

105
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:58,739
you into a pizza eating video gamer

106
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:00,479
that's clearly not the case and that

107
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,280
education I think was pivotal in being

108
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,560
able to help increase the amount of

109
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,019
Physicians prescribing from four percent

110
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,140
in Canada to north of 30 percent in a

111
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,780
matter of about four years

112
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:14,399
to reiterate the second topic as well we

113
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,978
need to look at actual standardization

114
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,019
here there's a really

115
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:20,519
um there's an interesting issue here is

116
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,500
because cannabis although it is a

117
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,600
narcotic it is not prescribed and

118
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,120
treated and consumed similar to other

119
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,460
narcotics in Canada we have something

120
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,100
called A din a drug identification

121
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:35,579
number which is what's required in order

122
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,040
in order to be able to have this listed

123
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:39,478
in pharmacies so unfortunately even

124
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,600
though it is a narcotic that is

125
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:44,180
prescribed the access to it has this

126
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,520
whole separate

127
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:49,500
tags of a path that you need to walk

128
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,879
down it is not as simple as seeing a

129
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,639
doctor getting a prescription and going

130
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,199
to a pharmacy and picking up so there's

131
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,418
this weird stigma that's still there

132
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,340
because it is treated differently so if

133
00:04:57,418 --> 00:05:01,019
we're able to educate doctors educate

134
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:02,339
patients and then standardize the

135
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:04,019
medicine and the practice of

136
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:05,819
Distributing it treating it like

137
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:07,620
everything else I think you'll see a

138
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:11,000
much more rapid expansion of medical

139
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,000
cannabis use and access

140
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:16,500
I think we need to think of cannabis

141
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,080
medicine as other medicine and the way

142
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,918
to improve patient outcomes is to foster

143
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:24,899
a personal relationship based on trust

144
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:26,399
and how do we do that the way we do that

145
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:27,120
is we need to give patients the time of

146
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,758
day

147
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,740
the time of day to talk about a medicine

148
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,240
which is different from other medicines

149
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,600
they've encountered a type of medicine

150
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,639
which it's not a doesn't attack just one

151
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,340
system in the body it's holistic it's

152
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,960
organic and it doesn't just it doesn't

153
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:45,299
just affect them in one part of their

154
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:48,120
lives but in many different parts of

155
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,939
their lives and ultimately we need to

156
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,038
remember that medical cannabis will have

157
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:54,899
the same issues as medicine in the

158
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,120
healthcare sector in general so just to

159
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:58,379
take a possibly a different approach we

160
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,379
need to look at the healthcare sector

161
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:04,259
and what is happening there and

162
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:06,360
we've just had the pandemic right so

163
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:08,460
this is also the Cannabis patient's

164
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,979
minds of going to their doctors

165
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:13,918
and especially when you have a choice

166
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:15,180
because in other aspects if you're sick

167
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:16,560
and you need a certain type of medicine

168
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,019
what you're going to do you're going to

169
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,699
go to the doctor in cannabis there's a

170
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:22,740
choice

171
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:25,800
I can go to a doctor but I can get it

172
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,960
from from my plug so what what is the

173
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,079
added benefit of going to the doctor I

174
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:33,418
think we need to as as clinicians and

175
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:36,599
anyone in this tree we need to think

176
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:39,180
about the the patient's um

177
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,120
point of view and we need to add value

178
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:44,939
to making medical cannabis really

179
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,220
medical and adding that value it it

180
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:48,719
takes time it takes a lot of time and it

181
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,120
needs to be tackled in a different way

182
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,220
from the way that medicine is being

183
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,259
tackled currently and it needs to be

184
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:59,039
patient-centric

185
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:00,960
we look at the patient and I I like how

186
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,459
medicine ties in with the Cannabis

187
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,560
industry and medical cannabis there was

188
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:07,138
a panel before this a great one the one

189
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,019
about branding and

190
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:12,300
um and Jamie said in in branding you

191
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:15,418
need to start backwards like in cannabis

192
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,639
you have to start with the consumer see

193
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:18,959
what they like and work backwards and in

194
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:21,300
medical cannabis it's just the same

195
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,698
thing we need to start with the patient

196
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,560
see what they like and work backwards

197
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,579
not the hospital or the institution or

198
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,860
the clinic

199
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:31,379
absolutely that's a very great point I

200
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,840
think one thing also is one of the

201
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:35,939
benefits with this active dialogue

202
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,638
surrounding the the legalization of

203
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:40,259
recreational Cannabis is that one of the

204
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,740
derivatives is that it's becoming maybe

205
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:45,240
less stigmatized slightly so Physicians

206
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,460
are maybe more open to having these

207
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,379
conversations but also I don't want to

208
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:52,519
Discount and I would like to highlight

209
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:55,500
the role of Pharmacists in this in this

210
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:57,060
constellation because oftentimes the the

211
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,220
pharmacists are a little more accessible

212
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,199
to the patients than the Physicians are

213
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,720
and I mean you guys mentioned it

214
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,139
education education education it's it's

215
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,419
required now to improve the patient

216
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,240
experience you really also have to

217
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:14,339
improve the physician experience in

218
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,019
Germany it's quite complex for a

219
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:17,399
physician to prescribe medical cannabis

220
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:18,899
to a patient there's a lot of steps

221
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,560
required a lot of work that needs to be

222
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:23,038
done

223
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,660
what are some of the barriers to entry

224
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,818
or let's say the the hurdles of

225
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,979
Physicians when considering to integrate

226
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,840
medical cannabis into their practice and

227
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:32,639
what can we do to tackle some of those

228
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:34,500
things so that we can increase access

229
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,718
for the patients by making the job of

230
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,719
the physician easier

231
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,219
I just want to focus on some of those I

232
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,959
think there's many more hurdles

233
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:45,600
especially bureaucratic hurdles and I

234
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,879
say this every year making it easier for

235
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,740
a doctor and a patient maybe means

236
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:53,159
breaking of cannabis culture in a way

237
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:55,259
meaning strain names Etc are I think

238
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:57,899
important uh When developing new

239
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:59,700
products but as a doctor if you need to

240
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:02,639
use free lines on a prescription just

241
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:05,640
for one medication that's a hassle so

242
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,199
we're we're very not only experienced

243
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:10,080
but we're also still actually advocating

244
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,540
you need simple product names you need

245
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,759
as a vendor you need a portfolio that

246
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:17,039
has an as an instinctive understanding

247
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:20,879
of you know what's a high grade what's a

248
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:23,458
low intensity Etc product in those ways

249
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,799
and and I think this is a trend that is

250
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:27,539
still happening in Germany but it's bad

251
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:29,399
from a doctor's perspective and I don't

252
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:31,980
mean me I don't I mean treating doctors

253
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,600
in Germany if you introduce products to

254
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,100
the market and you already know you're

255
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,320
gonna take it off the market in three

256
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,720
months I think that works for certain

257
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,420
kinetics but for the majority of doctors

258
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,000
and especially in the future market so

259
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:47,458
in a restructured market in an RX Market

260
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,799
in a non-narcotic Market persistency

261
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:52,379
consistency with product availability

262
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:53,879
product stability and quality but also

263
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:55,860
pricing in the pharmacies is very

264
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:57,838
important I think when you look at

265
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,580
Germany and if you look at especially

266
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,040
privately insured Patients health Pay

267
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,839
Market which is the only growing Market

268
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:05,458
um it's crucial to understand that even

269
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,899
the doctors know the prices of the

270
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,219
pharmacies and they look at it because

271
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:11,278
it's in the best interest of their

272
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:13,800
patients so I think it's very especially

273
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,419
as as Jean-Claude said cannabis is very

274
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:17,219
much different and there's an overlap of

275
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:19,740
medicine but also from a doctor's

276
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,660
perspective many things are completely

277
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,519
new topics you're treating patients

278
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:25,679
suddenly you have to look at inventory

279
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,539
and prices and availability at

280
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,819
pharmacies

281
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:32,219
I think one of the things uh for

282
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,500
Physicians is we need to equip them with

283
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,139
evidence science and data so that they

284
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,940
have the confidence uh prescribing and

285
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:41,159
they know what dosage forms they're

286
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,980
prescribing so that only can happen if

287
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:46,139
industry and companies are providing the

288
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,480
right compounds they're consistent uh

289
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:50,699
API quality active ingredients for

290
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,659
clinical studies so that Physicians do

291
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,160
have the confidence they know the

292
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:54,778
dosages they know where they're going I

293
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:57,860
mean it is a tragedy if you look at it

294
00:10:54,778 --> 00:11:00,120
some jurisdictions in the UK in Europe

295
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,740
uh less than 10 percent of the

296
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,379
registered patients are getting access

297
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,659
to these medicines but what's important

298
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:10,139
I think is to breaking it down to one

299
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:12,600
the molecule first understanding what uh

300
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:16,019
the different compounds are then having

301
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,220
that a clinical uh background studied so

302
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:18,480
that then the Physicians have the

303
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,300
confidence to know what they're

304
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,519
prescribing also Physicians will need to

305
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:24,838
know you know are there harms are there

306
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,278
side effects just like at the end of

307
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,540
pharmaceutical drug if we're going to

308
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:29,159
prescribe these things we need to know

309
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:31,319
and the Physicians need to have the

310
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:33,360
confidence to do that so that they can

311
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,040
build trust and continue to do this so

312
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,919
those are two very important points for

313
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,919
my my perspective uh to increase the uh

314
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:43,439
physician recognitions

315
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:45,479
yeah it's uh it's quite fascinating when

316
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,980
we saw recreational come out in in

317
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,220
Canada

318
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:52,019
um we had Canada's been a large consumer

319
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,759
of cannabis for quite some time I'd like

320
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:55,500
to think that outside of the Physicians

321
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,019
the cannabis use has been largely

322
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,700
destigmatized in our country

323
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:02,399
um when we started introducing it as a

324
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,379
medicine I myself was actually quite

325
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,539
surprised for that the

326
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:08,100
um a quick back story I'm I'm a Dutch

327
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:09,958
guy from Vancouver which I think are

328
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,379
like the two like largest cannabis

329
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:14,578
consuming areas in the world and I had

330
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:17,539
never thought of this as a medicine

331
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:20,879
until I suffered a very extreme injury

332
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:24,480
and it was through an uh synthetic

333
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:26,100
opioid addiction from post-surgery that

334
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,159
I discovered using cannabis as a

335
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:32,700
medicine and when when we introduced

336
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:35,338
recreational Cannabis it kind of created

337
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,740
this very interesting overlap between

338
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:40,320
what is medicine and what is

339
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,180
recreational use and I'll I'll publicly

340
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,278
admit that I am both a medical user and

341
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:46,799
a recreational user and I do believe

342
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:49,200
that there's two distinct uses and two

343
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,838
two distinct different purposes for it

344
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,100
as much as there is an overlap I think

345
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,500
this is something that we need to really

346
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,720
really really look at here it does

347
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,759
actually confuse a lot of Physicians

348
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,440
when they see patients that actually are

349
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,078
able to consume it on a recreational

350
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,519
side and it does also create some

351
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,620
confusion with respect to when they're

352
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,480
prescribing it as well if you were to

353
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,600
look at it with respect to an opioids

354
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,500
say like Dilaudid or

355
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,180
um

356
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:20,240
uh Percocets or oxycontinent you know

357
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:22,500
people that use those recreationally

358
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,180
there's a big stigma attached to it

359
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,100
whereas there is less of a stigma with

360
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:28,019
cannabis you would not prescribe

361
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,879
somebody x amount of oxycontinent

362
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:33,179
knowing that they would be actually

363
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:35,458
using that on using it recreationally on

364
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,778
top of it because it will of course mess

365
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,799
with the regimen of what you were

366
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:39,179
prescribing

367
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:42,059
so there are a lot of very different

368
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:44,638
variables that a doctor needs to keep in

369
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:46,919
mind with respect to cannabis use in

370
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,740
prescribing and I'll follow up with uh

371
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:51,240
with what Jean-Claude said as well is

372
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,820
there certainly does need to be a

373
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,500
holistic approach and this is not

374
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,720
exactly throwing a monkey wrench in the

375
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,399
system but it is most certainly changing

376
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,440
the pathway to A system that doctors

377
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:04,559
have been very very very streamlined

378
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,620
doing where they look at say body weight

379
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:10,018
appetite severity of pain all of these

380
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,539
different variables and then they fix a

381
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:14,220
number and a narcotic attached to it

382
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:17,399
it's there's a certain degree of

383
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,200
mathematics and systems that have checks

384
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,120
and balances there one that's for

385
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,420
accountability two not to kill people

386
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,700
and three to also save the a doctor's

387
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:28,199
license as well so that there needs to

388
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,019
be these checks and balances when you

389
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,019
look at something holistic

390
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:35,399
there is no two people that are the same

391
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:37,500
and the way that people interact with

392
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,299
the cannabinoids if it's completely

393
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,698
different different as well when you

394
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:43,500
start looking at all these different

395
00:14:40,698 --> 00:14:45,059
synthetic narcotics it is far more

396
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,278
predictable how the body is going to

397
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:49,078
interact with these things now what

398
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:52,078
people don't understand is that if I

399
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:54,299
have had a full full meal in me and 10

400
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,039
hours of sleep five milligrams of

401
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:57,359
Dilaudid is going to affect me a lot

402
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:59,759
differently than if I had five

403
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,339
milligrams of Dilaudid with very little

404
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,958
very little to eat very little sleep and

405
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:06,959
a lot of stress you metabolize these

406
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:08,819
narcotics differently so I think in Full

407
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,679
Circle we do need to take a lot more

408
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,540
accountability for Physicians and

409
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:15,120
patients to be have a more holistic

410
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:16,439
approach and recognize that we're we're

411
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,879
prescribing something that's going to be

412
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,860
a moving Target

413
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:22,078
no matter what people are people

414
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:24,539
metabolize narcotics differently they

415
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,638
react to narcotics differently and this

416
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:29,698
does need to be a pathway that needs to

417
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,159
be Ever Changing ever adapting and just

418
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:33,838
like our human bodies are so this is

419
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,120
certainly no easy task

420
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,160
but I do believe that an organic

421
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,899
holistic approach again

422
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,939
um an esteemed colleague of mine was

423
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:43,379
commenting on this too it's more work

424
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,139
but I think it's going to save the world

425
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:49,320
from a lot more

426
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:51,839
um a lot more opioid addictions going

427
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,579
forward a lot more misuse of Narcotics

428
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,139
and I do believe that we'll have a much

429
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:57,778
more healthy Society if we're able to

430
00:15:55,139 --> 00:16:00,659
start educating people on how to be able

431
00:15:57,778 --> 00:16:01,980
to react to different narcotics on how

432
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,299
to be able to understand what their

433
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,820
bodies and their minds are doing when

434
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:07,620
they are using these narcotics and

435
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,680
educated Doctrine how to be able to

436
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,799
safely educate patients on using these

437
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:15,419
narcotics

438
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,219
exactly that and just to follow up I I

439
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:19,620
really like the point uh Bernard said

440
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:22,199
about data and about how data is

441
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:24,600
important the thing is and this is maybe

442
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:27,419
a challenge that we have nowadays we

443
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,920
have so much data coming into Physicians

444
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,599
and we have to remember in medical

445
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:31,740
school what are you trained on in

446
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,959
medical school you're trained to use

447
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,820
this analog you know stethoscope these

448
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:37,919
analog stuff but then you go into real

449
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,540
practice and you have a computer and all

450
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:42,299
you're seeing is data sets data sets

451
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:44,578
data sets so ultimately we need to find

452
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:48,838
a way to help the doctors turn those

453
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:50,899
data sets into actionable insights you

454
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,740
know you take actions and and

455
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:55,139
based on what you're seeing you

456
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,000
understand it and you know what

457
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,579
prescription or what move or what the

458
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,958
next clinical uh judgment decision you

459
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:03,838
need to take in the best interest of

460
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,938
your patients and again it gets so

461
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,459
complex like Stephen said it can get so

462
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:10,679
complex so you need to be ever adjusting

463
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:13,558
you need to be dynamic

464
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:16,798
um so we need to ultimately give doctors

465
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:18,418
the ability not only when they're seeing

466
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,539
the patient but also after that to

467
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:23,160
monitor their patients and see

468
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:25,318
continuously what is happening on many

469
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,740
different spheres we mentioned being

470
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:30,500
holistic so it's not just about what

471
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,519
it's what is happening on a maybe

472
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,839
whether they're feeling good or not

473
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:35,819
feeling good but we need to have

474
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,939
biological data we need to have data

475
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:40,819
sets which can tell us exactly what is

476
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,440
happening in your body

477
00:17:40,819 --> 00:17:47,159
and ultimately just like Stephen said

478
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:50,160
when we start getting this right

479
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,779
the floodgates are open and what we're

480
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,759
doing I think and I think it's

481
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,740
interesting and being in the Cannabis

482
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,240
space we're already getting uh one thing

483
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,980
right the first tick box is already

484
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,839
there because I think one of the biggest

485
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,660
problems in mainstream Healthcare is

486
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:04,859
their rigidity not to explore these new

487
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,160
things so one of the things that

488
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:09,538
patients like most about any cannabis

489
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,160
clinic or any Clinic which is offering

490
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:14,160
alternative medicine is

491
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,960
I'm getting an alternative in the old

492
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,340
days even asking for an alternative and

493
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,960
you were shoot away from the clinic what

494
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:20,699
do you mean are you talking about this

495
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,019
kind of things I'm like and now we have

496
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,179
clinics which are actually offering

497
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:25,918
professional guidance for alternative

498
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:28,620
therapies so this is already something

499
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,120
which we're doing really well and

500
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:31,859
I don't know if this is a big statement

501
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:35,038
but I think that what we do in cannabis

502
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:36,839
medicine will send shock waves across

503
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:38,400
medicine in general because we're taking

504
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:39,779
a different approach and we're starting

505
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,340
with what the patient wants if the

506
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:43,798
patient wants to know about alternative

507
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:45,779
Therapies in a scientific way

508
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:47,940
and we're there to provide it this will

509
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:51,058
this will really uh have a big change

510
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:53,038
and we can do a lot for doctors for

511
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:53,940
doctors warrants

512
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:55,859
um

513
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,779
especially especially if we want to get

514
00:18:55,859 --> 00:19:00,240
more doctors to be prescribing you need

515
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:01,798
to be safe you know when I first got

516
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,839
into cannabis medicine I did very early

517
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:05,819
so I got this illusion very early from

518
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,038
the hospital setting

519
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:10,259
um so definitely in my in my grade in my

520
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:12,298
in my year I was the first doctor to

521
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:14,879
venture out privately do alternative

522
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:17,038
medicine and when I meet my friends in

523
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,960
bars and and I can tell you a lot of

524
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:20,279
young doctors we certainly use cannabis

525
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,079
and we use

526
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:24,298
um and a lot of doctors know the science

527
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,939
so it's not taught in in schools and

528
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:29,038
there's no education true but doctors

529
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,019
are inquisitive people we we research we

530
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,700
want to know and many doctors they say

531
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:34,500
you know I it's not that I don't believe

532
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,538
in it when I ask them you know come on

533
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,940
join me join my clinic you know it's

534
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:41,700
cool and they say I'm scared I'm scared

535
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:45,240
for my warrant took me seven years and I

536
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,798
you know and a kidney to get here and

537
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,960
I'm not ready to go out and lose it all

538
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,298
so we need to give doctors like we said

539
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,759
the confidence to to go ahead

540
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:57,058
um and change the world for the patients

541
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,859
absolutely I think what's unique to the

542
00:19:57,058 --> 00:20:01,319
the Cannabis industry is that as you

543
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:03,119
mentioned uh you know teachings about

544
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:05,099
the endocannabinoid system and the plant

545
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,139
are not part of the traditional medical

546
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:10,019
school so the onus falls on us as an

547
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:12,080
industry to educate the Physicians or

548
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:14,339
fight to have this kind of curriculum

549
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:15,058
introduced to medical schools around the

550
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:17,220
world

551
00:20:15,058 --> 00:20:19,319
as somebody that has spent years in the

552
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,600
field here in Germany visiting hundreds

553
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:25,678
of Physicians I can tell you it's it's

554
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:27,839
difficult uh as a farmer rapper or as a

555
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,419
company to be the one to help a

556
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:32,038
physician take that first step they need

557
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:33,419
to hear from other Physicians they need

558
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:35,099
to hear from scientists they need to

559
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:37,080
hear the data like you said

560
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:38,279
and I want to just touch on the point

561
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:40,319
that you made Julian about the

562
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,480
bureaucracy that's that's tied to it

563
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,819
when I was Visiting Physicians really

564
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,919
the one thing that convinced many of

565
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:49,558
them to actually consider implementing

566
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:51,660
uh cannabis was a tool that I was

567
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:55,379
introducing them to that digitized the

568
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:59,279
entire reimbursement process and I think

569
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:01,320
that's a great way of developing Tech to

570
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,440
ease the burden on the Physicians and

571
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:06,960
the and you know increase access and I'm

572
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,580
joined here by a number of Industry

573
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,980
colleagues that are implementing Tech in

574
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:12,960
a number of very different uh of

575
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,599
different ways so perhaps you could

576
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,759
touch on the role that Tech plays right

577
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:20,099
now in making cannabis more accessible

578
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:22,558
but also with the recent Innovations and

579
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:25,439
you know Technologies such as Ai and ml

580
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:28,319
where is the integration of Technology

581
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,600
heading to further develop this market

582
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,798
and make the access for patients more

583
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:33,839
streamlined

584
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:35,158
I think we always look at it uh

585
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:36,959
primarily from an operational

586
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:39,539
perspective so where are potential

587
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,759
hiccups in the patient Journey because

588
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:43,740
again I think that's really frustrating

589
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,658
but keeping people away or actually

590
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,859
having them leave treatment because

591
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:48,720
they're basically saying hey this is

592
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:50,639
just too complicated before I was used

593
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,200
to getting prescription and picking up

594
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,700
on the next Corner that doesn't work in

595
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,159
cannabis

596
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,960
um we are very much data focused and in

597
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,760
a way of you know having data from all

598
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,159
these access points so from from doctors

599
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,599
and their their notes I'm a radiologist

600
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,659
originally so I come from structure

601
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:08,099
reporting machine readable data

602
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,380
um same with the patients and

603
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:11,819
prescriptions and also the pharmacists

604
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,640
um it's interesting I think looking at

605
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:16,500
data it's crucial to zoom out more so we

606
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,020
look at data for more than 100 doctors

607
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,298
and we use that data to educate them

608
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:22,798
because my personal experience in

609
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,538
general medicine but also in cannabis

610
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,940
medicine is that doctors overestimate

611
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:29,579
their their personal data that they

612
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,019
collect and never step outside that and

613
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:32,460
then start to realize okay I could have

614
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:33,900
treated that patient different and the

615
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,159
outcome would have been better we've

616
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,780
just finished the first University

617
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:39,059
collaborations first paper being

618
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:41,940
accepted and we saw as a consequence of

619
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:43,619
focus on operational focus and that's

620
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,720
where you invest in a lot into Tech and

621
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:48,418
operations in the pharmacy for the

622
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,819
patients in the app for doctors they

623
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:52,500
have a better outcome so our thesis is

624
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:54,178
really if you have a better operational

625
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,279
experience

626
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:57,600
your medical outcome will be impacted

627
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:00,058
it's not just about the medication

628
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,980
itself it's about the journey along the

629
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:03,839
way and obviously we're getting in into

630
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,819
a direction of

631
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,158
um using that data not only to educate

632
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:09,058
doctors patients pharmacists but also

633
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,700
making

634
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:13,859
um you know data-based uh suggestions so

635
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,019
for example if you pluck terpene

636
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:17,879
profiles into that equation into the

637
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:20,819
algorithm and you have all the data

638
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,039
available from you know an anonymous so

639
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:25,139
medical history of that patient certain

640
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:27,779
contraindications certain indications

641
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:30,240
then you become very good at predicting

642
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:33,538
not only is medical cannabis a good fit

643
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,159
for that patient but also which type one

644
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:37,319
of the I think in German pharmacies up

645
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,520
to 200 different strains that makes a

646
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:40,558
big impact

647
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,720
um there and then you can plug that in

648
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:45,178
because even the doctors with a lot of

649
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,120
knowledge are asking for how can I treat

650
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:52,580
my patient based on terpene profiles and

651
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:52,579
not just TS THC CBD ratio

652
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:56,940
um Innovation I think is going to be key

653
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:59,038
for the sector uh Innovation uh combined

654
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:01,500
with combination products I think is

655
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,599
this going to be the future but

656
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,579
um you know looking at things like how

657
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,379
do we enhance bioavailability how do we

658
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:09,538
enhance solubility

659
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:12,120
um how do we enhance stability how do we

660
00:24:09,538 --> 00:24:13,619
get targeted formulations uh out there

661
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:16,379
right and that's something us at brains

662
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:18,479
bio with our partners DSM for minutia

663
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,700
are really focused on on the next

664
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,339
Horizon and going Beyond just you know

665
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:25,380
CBD as a golden child looking at CBN CBC

666
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:27,359
major and minor cannabinoids

667
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,880
understanding what we can do and coming

668
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:32,158
out with targeted formulations is going

669
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,960
to be really key to the Future uh one

670
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,539
area that really excites me also is

671
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,640
sports science how do we take all of our

672
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:40,798
learnings our clinical studies and look

673
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,320
at Sports Nutrition enhancement athletes

674
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:45,480
travel a lot we know that sleep is a big

675
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:47,220
problem for them inflammation is a big

676
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,620
problem for them so how do we work on

677
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:51,240
performance nutrition and that is what

678
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:53,399
Innovation is going to bring to this but

679
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,798
also Innovation is what's going to help

680
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,860
continue to bring down the stigma when

681
00:24:55,798 --> 00:25:00,720
we could bring in new dosage forms we

682
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:03,058
could bring in dosage forms that are

683
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,558
more acceptable uh other than flour and

684
00:25:03,058 --> 00:25:05,819
oils for people that's going to help

685
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:07,678
bring down the stigma and it's going to

686
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:09,298
be huge I think Innovation and

687
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,440
combination products is something that

688
00:25:09,298 --> 00:25:12,558
I'm really looking forward to in the

689
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,558
future

690
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,038
um it's interesting when we're looking

691
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:18,298
at a holistic organic product and trying

692
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:21,599
to incorporate

693
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:22,798
uh technology into this this is one

694
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:24,119
thing that that's rather interesting

695
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:25,918
when you think of holistic medicine

696
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:27,899
something that I've heard many many

697
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,278
interesting stories from JC over here

698
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,860
and I urge you to spend some time with

699
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,058
them hearing about his travels

700
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:35,519
incorporating technology into these

701
00:25:33,058 --> 00:25:38,220
types of original traditional medicines

702
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,960
is a big jump because you're looking at

703
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,278
two Polar Opposites of the situation

704
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,798
here

705
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:45,538
um one one instance where we found that

706
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:48,058
we could introduce technology without

707
00:25:45,538 --> 00:25:49,859
kind of disrupting the actual natural

708
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:51,538
course that this medicine has

709
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:54,000
traditionally been used for and where I

710
00:25:51,538 --> 00:25:56,278
found it has been most beneficial is

711
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,679
with respect to actually using tech for

712
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:02,519
accessibility not necessarily using Tech

713
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:04,200
to alter the how you consume or how the

714
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:06,000
product interacts with your body but

715
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,240
more or less using Tech to be able to

716
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,740
help with access and in fact uh hello

717
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,558
cannabis was actually the very first

718
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:16,500
Clinic to be able to offer to be

719
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:18,778
accepted into the otn the otn is the

720
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,759
Ontario Telehealth Network so what this

721
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:23,400
allowed was for doctors to be able to

722
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:25,859
prescribe cannabis through a video

723
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:29,640
conference call and this was something

724
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:31,500
that had tremendously helped our access

725
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,640
because once again there were only four

726
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,519
percent of Physicians that were

727
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,840
prescribing now quite a quite a few of

728
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:38,879
those were actually working with us at

729
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:40,859
one point and it allowed us to be able

730
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,900
to spread the access and be able to

731
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:44,939
actually have them meet patients from

732
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,620
around the province which is rather

733
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,659
large I believe larger than Germany

734
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:50,658
actually by size

735
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:53,220
um and and be able to increase access

736
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:54,960
now when a pandemic happened of course

737
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,538
that technology was no longer useful

738
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,360
because everybody had access to video

739
00:26:57,538 --> 00:27:02,158
but uh what I do find is when we're able

740
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:04,918
to incorporate technology that's going

741
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:08,159
to be able to benefit a holistic and

742
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:10,620
organic approach to a medication to a

743
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,140
traditional medicine I think you can

744
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:15,599
find like a happy Sweet Spot there

745
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:19,799
um I I don't think that cannabis needs

746
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:22,439
to necessarily be going down a future

747
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:25,019
um Tech hole but I do believe that we do

748
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,120
need to see some form of standardization

749
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:30,179
with this product a lot more consistency

750
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:32,298
in utilizing technology for data

751
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:35,640
utilizing technology for Education

752
00:27:32,298 --> 00:27:37,158
utilizing data and technology for

753
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,259
accessibility

754
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:42,720
and I do truly think that you can find a

755
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:44,759
way to be able to Harbor the future and

756
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,798
have it work cohesively and collaborate

757
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:48,019
with the past of traditional holistic

758
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:50,400
medicine

759
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:53,339
and we can finally be able to get the

760
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,740
best of both worlds I I don't think we

761
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:58,918
are getting to the uh the the Terminator

762
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:02,339
future with everything becoming very

763
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:03,840
standardized and and pill form and I I

764
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:06,000
do think that we need to hold on to

765
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:09,178
traditional holistic medical Roots I

766
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,460
have found that as somebody that has uh

767
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:14,278
has a very strong daily regimen of

768
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,679
medications required for for chronic

769
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:18,720
injuries

770
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:21,059
the traditional holistic route certainly

771
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,640
allows me to be able to function and

772
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:27,058
operate at my highest

773
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,860
um and every other synthetic form I have

774
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:30,839
found that it has actually been an

775
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:33,839
inebriation and it has also been

776
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:35,879
something that has kind of put me put me

777
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:38,459
slower and unable to be able to perform

778
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,140
at my highest ability so finding the

779
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,679
balance between technology and a

780
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:45,179
holistic traditional using technology

781
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:47,460
and have that Harbor with a traditional

782
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:49,019
holistic medication I think you're going

783
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,700
to be able to see a strong successful

784
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:52,798
program with respect to cannabis

785
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,960
unfortunately no doctor is ever going to

786
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:57,058
prescribe something that you come well

787
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,980
let me rephrase that please a doctor

788
00:28:57,058 --> 00:29:01,019
will

789
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:03,120
very rarely condone and prescribe

790
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:06,000
something that you are going to combust

791
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:07,500
and smoke in your lungs that seems to be

792
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,880
something that everybody here can agree

793
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,619
on I hope

794
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,200
um but that being said there is also

795
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:15,119
something it is also an extremely fast

796
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,700
and effective and controlled way to be

797
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:18,599
able to get this medication into your

798
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,120
system

799
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:22,798
so we have been able to find ways and

800
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,778
use technology to be able to actually

801
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:26,700
isolate the amount of cannabinoids that

802
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:28,440
are coming in and we have found

803
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,140
different ways in order to be able to

804
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,200
use this holistic medicine without

805
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:36,720
having the

806
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,278
subjectivity and irregularity of how

807
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,679
much a narcotic you're introducing into

808
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:44,339
your body by utilizing some of this

809
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:46,019
technology as well so uh it's it's still

810
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:48,798
kind of a weird faux pas when you start

811
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:51,839
talking about high tech in the future

812
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:54,480
with a very traditional holistic

813
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:56,339
medication but there is a balance in my

814
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,940
personal belief is that technology

815
00:29:56,339 --> 00:30:01,158
should be used in other areas outside of

816
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,960
the actual

817
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:05,520
indusion to be of the medication use

818
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,079
that technology to be able to help with

819
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:08,759
data sets to be able to help with

820
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:11,460
education to be able to help with

821
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:15,720
destigmatic destigmatization to be able

822
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:19,558
to help with accessibility however don't

823
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:22,079
mess with something if it isn't broke

824
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:24,058
um cannabis is not a broken medicine it

825
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:26,220
works and I don't think we need to

826
00:30:24,058 --> 00:30:27,720
really take this to the Future and have

827
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,399
this into a totally synthesized

828
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,720
structure

829
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:32,158
um having a did number would certainly

830
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,960
help access and it would certainly help

831
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,360
destigmatize and get more doctors on

832
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,419
board but just as JC made a very strong

833
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:41,219
Counterpoint to what I was saying before

834
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:43,620
I don't believe it's going taking a

835
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:48,798
unholistic approach to any form of

836
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:48,798
medication is the is the answer as well

837
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:54,058
exactly that so

838
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:56,960
um at celtex what we do is we use

839
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:59,339
biological data from an individual

840
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,640
to assess and measure what is happening

841
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:04,980
in an individual's body when using plant

842
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,960
medicine taking trying to take plant

843
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,480
medicine out of the shadows out of this

844
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,038
this Voodoo medicine Shadows which which

845
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,659
we're not comfortable with mainstream

846
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:14,879
doctors are uncomfortable with and try

847
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:17,278
to give them data from which they can

848
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,500
make insights they can take insights out

849
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:21,480
of that and make like we said actionable

850
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,640
decisions

851
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,579
um but like Stephen is saying it's not

852
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,960
just about using it to to measure

853
00:31:26,579 --> 00:31:29,639
biological data something we learned

854
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,579
really early on is

855
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,140
the tech is really a solution all across

856
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:36,720
for different aspects of Stephen

857
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:39,480
mentioned some I'll mention another

858
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,600
um uh with regards to to Insurance we've

859
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,038
spoken about bureaucracy and how Tech

860
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:45,839
can help that you mentioned that tool

861
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:47,759
I'll mention another staff shortage

862
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:50,278
Healthcare is going through one of the

863
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,200
biggest stuff shortages ever since the

864
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:53,640
pandemic so

865
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,620
um I know there are a lot of people from

866
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:58,320
North America here I have some numbers

867
00:31:55,619 --> 00:32:00,839
from there that even though uh eight

868
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:03,119
percent of all healthcare jobs are open

869
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:06,599
at this point we still have 400

870
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:08,819
000 less people working in healthcare

871
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:10,859
um in North America so the same thing is

872
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:12,480
in Europe and wherever I've gone it's

873
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:15,719
always doctors are overworked doctors

874
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:18,419
are over tired and if you remember jars

875
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,700
with what I started with of

876
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:22,500
um giving patients the time of the day

877
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,899
to encourage and Foster that personal

878
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:27,119
relationship and Foster that trust and I

879
00:32:24,898 --> 00:32:28,339
think Tech can play a role here by

880
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:31,259
encouraging

881
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:33,119
the patients to use Tech and engage with

882
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:35,700
tech we can foster that personal

883
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:39,119
relationship through Tech despite the

884
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:40,200
shortage of staff that we have so really

885
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:42,119
it's

886
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,798
it's about finding solutions for the

887
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:45,479
different problems and I think the most

888
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:47,398
important thing because it's an easy

889
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,839
sell right finding Solutions of the

890
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:51,298
problems but we need to make sure that

891
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:52,918
we're targeting all the stakeholders so

892
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:55,019
when we're developing tech let's not

893
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:57,299
just think about tech Fair patients

894
00:32:55,019 --> 00:32:59,038
statistic for tech for everyone so Tech

895
00:32:57,298 --> 00:33:00,720
also for the industry to be able to

896
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:02,759
allocate resources

897
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,460
well let's think of tech for the

898
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:07,140
pharmacists to be able to be able to

899
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,399
follow up to be able to see is there

900
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:12,120
medicine working well are there any

901
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:13,979
changes leading to lies with the doctor

902
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:16,459
um and ultimately

903
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,960
I also believe that we need to look at

904
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:21,179
data we're going to go back there we

905
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,240
need to look at data differently

906
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:25,500
um and just like care has gone from

907
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,319
institution-centric to patient-centric

908
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:30,058
it's the same thing with data we need to

909
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:32,038
empower patients because it is

910
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:33,418
empowering to own their own Medical Data

911
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:35,398
I don't know the last time you needed

912
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:36,600
like a scan or something but but I

913
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:38,278
needed to scan ones from from my

914
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:40,319
hospital I needed you needed to go to

915
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:43,319
customer care and wait two hours and

916
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:45,480
have that burnt on a CD-ROM as if anyone

917
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:47,220
you know still uses those

918
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,599
um and it made me think that patients

919
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,159
really don't have access to their

920
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:54,000
medical data I mean do you have access

921
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,559
to the to the data to maybe a CT scan

922
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,079
you had when you were 10 years old no

923
00:33:55,558 --> 00:34:01,798
but it's your data it's the patient's

924
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:04,619
data so I think Tech can really serve to

925
00:34:01,798 --> 00:34:06,599
democratize data for patients because

926
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:09,960
once you Empower patients to have that

927
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:11,460
medical data about themselves then they

928
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,139
can be the ones and we talked about this

929
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,358
going backwards and starting with the

930
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:17,039
patient they can be the ones to go to

931
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:19,259
the other stakeholders to the industry

932
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,358
to the pharmacy to the doctors and tell

933
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,339
them this is my data I'd like to share

934
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:25,619
it with you I'd like you to help me I'd

935
00:34:23,338 --> 00:34:27,480
like to add value as a clinician as a

936
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:28,919
pharmacist and finally this is the

937
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,139
product that I want this is the product

938
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:34,079
that works for my body

939
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:36,019
absolutely I would just like to add on

940
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:40,019
to that too that

941
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:42,719
Tech can also help in the quality of

942
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:45,980
data that's collected from consumers

943
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:47,878
especially now when you have uh you know

944
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:51,179
vaporizers for example that are

945
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:53,519
connected to iot to basically have

946
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:55,559
immediate data transfer on the usage of

947
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,420
different different medicines to kind of

948
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:59,579
alleviate any kind of risk in the

949
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,858
quality of data that you collect and

950
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:04,380
also you know we didn't touch on this

951
00:35:01,858 --> 00:35:07,019
yet but I think that you know machine

952
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:08,700
learning and Ai and even blockchain in

953
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:10,800
some instances are going to be

954
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:13,319
absolutely crucial in Expediting the

955
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,019
process of finished pharmaceutical drug

956
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,119
development I mean we have hundreds of

957
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:19,500
products on the market in Germany and

958
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:22,200
only two products that are actually

959
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,760
Market authorized so I think Tech is

960
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:27,419
going to be actually absolutely crucial

961
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,880
in developing these uh Market authorized

962
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:32,820
Finnish Pharmaceuticals ladies and

963
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,320
gentlemen uh I am going to take the last

964
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,940
seven and a half minutes or this

965
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,099
opportunity first of all to see if

966
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,559
anyone in the audience has any questions

967
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:44,000
for the panel first of all let's hear it

968
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:44,000
for the panel yay

969
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:48,539
very exciting you're also young and

970
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,119
smart

971
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:52,380
my man Javier over here ran over he's

972
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,519
like are they going to take questions I

973
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,260
have a very important question so

974
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:57,119
fingers crossed Javier what was your

975
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:00,540
question quick question

976
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:03,480
um as an introduction I'm a

977
00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:05,940
recreational user that takes a lot of

978
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:09,440
cannabis every day and at the same time

979
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:12,780
I'm a breather I have a partnership with

980
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,700
some legendary breathers from Spain

981
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,740
and one of the things that I notice

982
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:20,219
because I'm very sensitive to the effect

983
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:23,279
of uh of what this thing does because I

984
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:27,019
also consume other psychedelics

985
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:31,500
um as as medicinal way not recreational

986
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:34,259
is that a lot of the land the some of

987
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:39,000
the strains that we produce that are

988
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:41,579
closer to the land race cultivars

989
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,838
they're not as potent but they give you

990
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:49,500
a steady result so my question is is

991
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:52,019
there anybody working on figuring out if

992
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:54,900
all these [ __ ] up with genetics that

993
00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:56,940
we're doing to try to provide the nice

994
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:59,940
little terpene taste to the kids in

995
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:03,000
California is messing up the medical

996
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:05,700
industry and is there room for the ones

997
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,500
that we still you know for the last 20

998
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:10,078
years we've been keeping those clones

999
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,358
and keep and having with that apparently

1000
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:15,839
it's not desirable anymore

1001
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:17,940
mind is there room for for a different

1002
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:21,239
type of breathing only for the medical

1003
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:22,920
business Stephen yeah if you don't mind

1004
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,419
I got to tackle this one please that's

1005
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,119
an unbelievable question and one that

1006
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:28,980
I've taken as a personal Journey as well

1007
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,660
um my original hobby being a Dutch guy

1008
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,280
from Vancouver and being exposed to

1009
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:35,399
cannabis since I've been like Grover

1010
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,859
since I've been this tall was actually a

1011
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,599
cultivation in genetics

1012
00:37:37,858 --> 00:37:40,980
um interestingly enough I actually had

1013
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,539
the privilege to be traveling the world

1014
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,420
trying to discover some of these land

1015
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:47,699
restraints and in fact I'm I'm wearing a

1016
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,619
pendant from uh which was a gift from

1017
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:51,419
the queen of Bhutan which is a country

1018
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:52,740
in between India and China where we were

1019
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:55,740
traveling in the Himalayan Mountains

1020
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:58,139
discovering land-based strains so when

1021
00:37:55,739 --> 00:38:01,319
when we talk about

1022
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:04,019
um land races and how when we start

1023
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,760
catering and breeding and changing

1024
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:08,759
things for like different candy for kids

1025
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,220
and whatnot let's let's look at dogs for

1026
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,140
example right like I don't like a

1027
00:38:11,219 --> 00:38:15,539
miniature pincer like that that is a dog

1028
00:38:13,139 --> 00:38:18,059
that I'm not even sure has a brain right

1029
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:20,338
like it it doesn't even know its own own

1030
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:22,980
name when you start really genetically

1031
00:38:20,338 --> 00:38:25,139
modifying things to the point where you

1032
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,420
are taking quote the best of one thing

1033
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:29,098
or quote the best of another thing and

1034
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:31,200
continually breeding and manipulating

1035
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:34,920
them you you do genuinely lose the soul

1036
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:36,598
I'm using that word very frivolously but

1037
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,039
I hope I hope everybody in the audience

1038
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:39,300
can kind of follow what I'm meaning by

1039
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:40,920
that

1040
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,660
um you are right you definitely lose the

1041
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,940
potent the land race strains certainly

1042
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:46,559
do not have the potency which is what

1043
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,659
all of these breeding programs have been

1044
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:52,259
trying to do but the most important

1045
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:54,239
thing that they have been losing is the

1046
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,460
actual medical benefit we have found

1047
00:38:54,239 --> 00:39:00,419
that land race strains have certainly

1048
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:02,039
had a far stronger Entourage effect and

1049
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:04,380
cannabinoid effect with respect to

1050
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:07,320
holistic medical therapy and I do

1051
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:10,320
believe that the further we can we are

1052
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:12,900
manipulating these land race strains the

1053
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,579
further away we are getting the the

1054
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,780
further we are getting away from an

1055
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:18,300
actual

1056
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:20,400
um holistic original medical approach

1057
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:22,380
here so

1058
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,139
um the balance between that's going to

1059
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:26,940
be very interesting and yes I do believe

1060
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:28,618
that we need to pay homage to some of

1061
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:30,960
the original land races and and The

1062
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:32,760
Growers and I'd love to talk to you um

1063
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,559
about some of the programs that that are

1064
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,240
there

1065
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:38,639
but again uh introducing that type of

1066
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:40,199
stuff to doctors is going to be

1067
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:41,940
extremely challenging again because of

1068
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:43,919
the organic aspect of it most of these

1069
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,480
land race strains are consumed by

1070
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,800
combustion which is not exactly

1071
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,019
something that's condoned by doctors

1072
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,519
very well it's a very big moving Target

1073
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:52,019
and one that I think you and I should

1074
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:54,300
have a private chat over I would love

1075
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:55,980
that just about something small that was

1076
00:39:54,300 --> 00:40:00,079
bang on the mark Stephen great question

1077
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:02,219
just at this note to all the audience

1078
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,920
however long humans have been playing

1079
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:06,838
with cannabis genetics the land races

1080
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,400
have been evolving with humans for

1081
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:11,578
hundreds of thousands of years for

1082
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,920
Millennia and so if that isn't the most

1083
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:15,180
the most um I think Nature has been

1084
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,500
playing around with genetics much longer

1085
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:18,419
than anyone else and we need to keep

1086
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,699
that in mind

1087
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:23,539
any other questions from the audience we

1088
00:40:20,699 --> 00:40:23,539
have a couple more minutes

1089
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,460
oh wait I had a question but I forgot it

1090
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,039
because I hit some hash while you were

1091
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,780
talking earlier same uh

1092
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:40,858
so it was because you were talking about

1093
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:42,720
the so as uh uh we've been evolving with

1094
00:40:40,858 --> 00:40:44,338
weed we've been evolving with us so

1095
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:46,980
would you call some of these new weeds

1096
00:40:44,338 --> 00:40:48,599
like a junk food or would you say that

1097
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:51,179
it's just further Evolution because

1098
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:53,400
young people like sweeter things and you

1099
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:54,719
know you know what I mean

1100
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,099
because everything tastes like a dessert

1101
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,779
all the old heads are always like bring

1102
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:01,619
back the weed that tastes like feet and

1103
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:02,820
cheese and burnt tires and a skunk but

1104
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:04,858
all the kids are like we like the

1105
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:06,000
Skittles and the candy and then right

1106
00:41:04,858 --> 00:41:07,679
when was the last time you had a coffee

1107
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,358
flavored weed or a wine flavored weed

1108
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:12,199
would you say that's just part of the

1109
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:16,078
evolution or would you say that

1110
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:17,219
it's more of a bastardization I think I

1111
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,140
think it depends on what you're doing

1112
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:20,759
with it at the end of the day

1113
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:21,838
um it's it's medical if it's

1114
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,440
recreational then you know whatever

1115
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:26,099
tastes fine is great but if it's medical

1116
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,000
um

1117
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:31,859
the human body is is the way it is so it

1118
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,300
changes very slowly and it doesn't adapt

1119
00:41:31,858 --> 00:41:38,819
as fast as modern society or especially

1120
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:41,039
not as fast as the industry uh changes

1121
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,420
and adapt so whenever we come up with uh

1122
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:43,920
with new strains especially I think in

1123
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:46,019
the medical sector we need to keep that

1124
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,720
in mind that if something is new and

1125
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:51,480
we're going too far away

1126
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:52,679
um from from what is natural we need to

1127
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,199
keep in mind that there's a question

1128
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:57,598
mark not saying it's bad but we need to

1129
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,159
remember that we don't know we're not

1130
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,440
sure I think we're just always saying to

1131
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:03,659
challenge why is it recreational versus

1132
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,519
medical so if you look at data from the

1133
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:08,219
US you see that in Recreation Mark

1134
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:10,440
Market 45 of people actually

1135
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:13,019
self-medicate and they're not fully

1136
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,780
aware so when anybody says hey this is

1137
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:17,159
reckoned as medical I always ask why is

1138
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,780
it wreck and what are you doing in there

1139
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:20,639
and then suddenly they start to say well

1140
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,680
I'm sleeping better I have less anxiety

1141
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:24,299
etc those are medical indications and

1142
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:26,578
that's also from a doctoral challenge

1143
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:28,680
because Steven also said to be about

1144
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:31,079
that and ask those questions but

1145
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:33,419
suddenly you see p patients uneducated

1146
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:35,940
about their own diseases yeah I I don't

1147
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,800
know a single cannabis consumer that

1148
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:41,039
says I do it because I like getting

1149
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:42,359
messed up right like I well sometimes I

1150
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:45,420
like to be high as hell I'm not gonna

1151
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:47,098
lie that's that that's totally fair but

1152
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,900
the I believe that there's a medical

1153
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:51,420
reason that you are doing that probably

1154
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:53,338
I was probably sad There you go

1155
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,260
so there's a perfect example right here

1156
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:57,299
where that is self-medicating right oh

1157
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:59,040
cannabis uses medical use according to
