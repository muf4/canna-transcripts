uh thanks and then um there's one with

51
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,840
meritek and we've been around since 67

52
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,359
we focus on specialized equipment for a

53
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,359
variety of industries including food

54
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,718
pharma and so forth and we've been doing

55
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,239
a lot in the cannabis and have industry

56
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,399
for about eight years now and it's about

57
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,319
60 to 70 of our business and growing so

58
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,159
it's a lot of fun

59
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,799
amazing so we're going to talk about

60
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,639
sustainability and we kind of switched

61
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,680
the topic a little bit from safety to

62
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,598
education because in canada anyways and

63
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,360
i know a lot of markets they over

64
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,039
regulate the cannabis plant which means

65
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,120
it's probably one of the safest

66
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,280
industries out there so i felt like

67
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,360
education is probably a more suitable

68
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,120
fit for the topic that we were speaking

69
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,120
on so i'm just going to start with you

70
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,680
jordan because uh you know you're right

71
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,519
beside me um you know what are the type

72
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,719
of things that you're wanting to do and

73
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,680
aiming for

74
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,919
to make your brand and sector

75
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,280
more sustainable and how do you plan on

76
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,919
educating these people during the

77
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,640
process of this

78
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,559
you know i am

79
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,719
and i feel like i talk about this ad

80
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,199
nauseum i think the real opportunity in

81
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,759
cannabis is not to educate or

82
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,878
necessarily create products for stoners

83
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,919
like me

84
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:03,598
i'm easy to create products for the real

85
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,439
opportunity is how do you create

86
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,359
products for my mom how do you solve for

87
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,840
specific needs states and then it goes

88
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,120
into how do we actually create that food

89
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,239
and beverage

90
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,920
that is healthier and you know i feel as

91
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,200
though and i was saying this to you in

92
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:22,238
the green room that i feel like you know

93
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,759
we've really got it backwards where

94
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,120
if you think about

95
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:30,000
product formulation as a relay race

96
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,480
we've started the relay race with this

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,560
food scientist rather than a culinarian

98
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,798
or mixologist who uses their palette for

99
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,120
a living and then actually passes that

100
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,439
baton and that chain of custody someone

101
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,560
who can work with shelf stability and

102
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:47,039
scaling and so on and so forth so i find

103
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,519
that there's really a lot of the same on

104
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,519
the market and i think that as we start

105
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,200
talking about or we continue talking

106
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,920
about what health and wellness looks

107
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,919
like and medical looks like in the

108
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,079
cannabis space then we really have to

109
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,158
look at ingredients and why are we

110
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,319
including refined sugar is something

111
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,479
that we're actually calling health and

112
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,639
wellness or medical

113
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,560
now do you find with

114
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,639
the new demographic of people that

115
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,318
you're trying to hit the the non-classic

116
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,518
stoner like you said which is very easy

117
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,039
to appease

118
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,798
do you find you have a lot of hurdles

119
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,359
being a private chef that's doing

120
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,279
private infused cannabis culinary

121
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,758
do you find it hard to market and

122
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,399
educate these new things that we need to

123
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,080
speak about if i told you the number of

124
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,758
you know i work at sick children's

125
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,240
hospital um i i work with a number of

126
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,319
jewish foundations and not-for-profits

127
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,319
across and i'm very proud of you know

128
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,719
all the philanthropy that i do

129
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,719
and all throughout the pandemic there

130
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,720
was one topic they wanted to talk about

131
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,880
virtually that's cannabis food and

132
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,720
beverage people want to understand it

133
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,879
they want to understand it better you

134
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,639
know i say it like this and my brilliant

135
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,959
brother wrote these words so i certainly

136
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,639
will take you know credit for it but we

137
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,638
are not going to reach these people by

138
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,800
handing them raws or zigzags and some

139
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,960
flour and saying go and roll your joints

140
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,600
you're going to say here's tomato sauce

141
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,599
you already use it take your mint tea it

142
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,160
doesn't have any sugar in it it actually

143
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,840
has some terpenes in it and it has the

144
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,720
benefits that you're looking for

145
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:18,000
whatever that case may be so i just i

146
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,600
think there's there's bigger

147
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,279
opportunities out there especially to

148
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,039
educate those that are

149
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,359
supposedly educating others i think

150
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,279
that's a big part of the opportunity too

151
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,840
amazing now ben

152
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,439
bovida clearly for years now has been

153
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,918
leading in

154
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,600
humidity packs and keeping your cannabis

155
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:37,519
healthy

156
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,000
clean and stabilized

157
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,079
uh for sustainability for yourself you

158
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,160
know clearly boveda is

159
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,639
actively doing that yeah i mean we win

160
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,880
the market for 25 years yeah so what

161
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,960
what cigars and multiple other products

162
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,399
so is there anything that ovita is going

163
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,279
to be doing in the future that's going

164
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,279
to be

165
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,559
accelerating sustainability even more

166
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,758
for you guys

167
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,000
like certainly

168
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,280
as a company yeah yeah of course i mean

169
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,199
we are constantly innovating for

170
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:06,159
instance we just introduced

171
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,680
like the over the principle into a cap

172
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,759
that you can just

173
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,000
just screw onto like a standard like

174
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,000
dropped plastic jar i mean i think that

175
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,478
you're taking the same principle and

176
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,319
like we're basically a one-two pony

177
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,399
you know with that that one trick we

178
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,400
survived 25 years and we still grow 30

179
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,638
percent here today you know as a 25 year

180
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,719
old company of course thanks to

181
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,199
us being able to have a myriad of use

182
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,039
cases for our application cannabis being

183
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,680
one of the more fun ones i have to say

184
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,038
right so it's uh so yeah but we do we do

185
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,600
a ton of stuff so for us i mean we're

186
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:40,240
constantly innovating um even though it

187
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,680
might just be small changes right but

188
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,680
but we

189
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,918
are not this goes back to our leadership

190
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,400
so san diego is a big part also about

191
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:50,079
the culture that we that we have

192
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,519
um

193
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,519
it's really like a community almost like

194
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,038
a cult if you talk with people they work

195
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,639
up over there they're all like ooh they

196
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:57,759
were raving but it's almost like a call

197
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,759
because everything everybody's so

198
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,520
positive and so forward thinking it's

199
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,520
it's it's really amazing i have to say

200
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:04,879
yeah and you guys got a great education

201
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:06,719
team that i've noticed you guys are

202
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,199
great educators and it's something that

203
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,639
is crucial because you know leading back

204
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,759
to the original panel we were speaking

205
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,879
with safety

206
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,680
safety you know comes with education so

207
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,038
yes

208
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,280
yes and for us i mean like our product

209
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,560
is very simple yeah

210
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,959
but yet if you really want to explain

211
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,240
how it works

212
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,000
there are two ways of doing it either

213
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,079
educate you just have people try it out

214
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,439
but i mean like for you i mean if you

215
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,800
just have you just

216
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,800
just try it out doesn't work in your

217
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,240
case it's too complicated it works in

218
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,240
our case luckily

219
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,319
you know but no education is vital for

220
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,918
us i mean it's just we have a very

221
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,759
niching product it's just about moisture

222
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,918
cannabis but i mean we can all agree

223
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,000
that dry weed just sucks right it's

224
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:48,000
terrible you know when it's too moist

225
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,839
it's also bad because all the microbes

226
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,598
you know so it's like bad for your

227
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,279
health yes right so you need something

228
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,800
that will keep it just right in between

229
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,119
this week but this is what we likely do

230
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,879
and we just happened to screw on us do

231
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,120
we we're the one from pony which is

232
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,199
that's what we do yeah right so yeah all

233
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,959
right definitely yes it's great it's an

234
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,080
awesome product

235
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:10,399
it is quite amazing

236
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,399
thank you

237
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,840
and then kyle you know ameritech's been

238
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,240
around the space like we were spoken

239
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:20,000
about earlier uh for

240
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,319
decades in multiple different markets um

241
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,560
i just learned about your new vapor

242
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,080
static distraction this week which is

243
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,839
very something new to me something that

244
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,159
i've never even seen or i've heard of

245
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:33,120
yet um why don't you break down the

246
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,120
process of your extraction um what your

247
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,440
team does and your plan for

248
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,799
sustainability and also educating moving

249
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,760
forward in your sector

250
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,639
so

251
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:44,879
well

252
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,159
the vapor static extraction it's a very

253
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,838
new type of technology that we're taking

254
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,120
to market right now

255
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,120
where we're really changing up the

256
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,240
extraction game with a big focus on

257
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,440
saving

258
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,879
reducing the amount of solvents and

259
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,240
going completely solventless being

260
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,679
better for the environment and also

261
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,600
reducing the amount of electrical needs

262
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,958
to extract as we're helping our clients

263
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,560
become much more sustainable in their

264
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,479
processes and what we do with it is we

265
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,479
actually vaporize the cannabis and then

266
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,080
we use as a technology called

267
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,159
electrostatic precipitation to

268
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,759
recondense it from a vapor back into an

269
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,159
oil form right so we also do other

270
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,838
things in regards to ethanol co2 water

271
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,039
extraction types but here's a new

272
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,560
solution that we're taking to market

273
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,480
right now where it's a much more

274
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,479
sustainable option a lot more easier to

275
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,639
operate and also from an education

276
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,480
standpoint of the operator team a lot

277
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,720
simpler right one operator can easily

278
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,879
run 100 pounds a day or 5 000 pounds a

279
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,480
day right so it's a very you know much

280
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,919
more sustainable technology too for the

281
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,159
environment as well with the you know

282
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,919
going to a completely solvent space now

283
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,079
when we spoke earlier on we spoke about

284
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,759
how you're doing the the thousand pound

285
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,278
a day machines right now

286
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,159
and when you explain the price to me

287
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:48,639
that it may scare certain people away

288
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,559
but you came back with a great answer

289
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,080
and it actually extremely excited to be

290
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,759
for the small people to be able to

291
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,560
operate these things you guys will be

292
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,319
coming out with a 100 and a 400 pound

293
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,479
extraction machine well for the smaller

294
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,160
clients as well correct yes yeah we're

295
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,680
going down to 100 a day system and

296
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,159
that's over 24 hours so someone's

297
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,919
looking to just operate let's say 30 40

298
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,519
pounds within a shift you'd be perfect

299
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,799
for that type of person an individual

300
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,320
too so amazing amazing so to me you know

301
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,559
with charlie's farmers market and

302
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,560
sustainability and being a retail store

303
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,359
especially with medical cannabis it's

304
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:24,639
very important um you know that

305
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,879
education on medical cannabis uh is the

306
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,838
most important as alex has mentioned

307
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:29,519
before

308
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,480
the lack thereof

309
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,200
uh in the cannabis space right now um i

310
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,720
think more education uh is important i

311
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,240
think to create any type of

312
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,600
sustainability it starts with the

313
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,000
regulators because there's a lot of

314
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,920
regulations in canada that they put into

315
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,240
place that doesn't always give us the

316
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,240
freedom to do what we need to do to

317
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,159
maybe make the industry more sustainable

318
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,159
and or educate better

319
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,679
so i'm hoping that lobbying the right

320
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,679
different sectors

321
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,519
and creating more sustainable products

322
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:59,120
whether it's hemp containers instead of

323
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,120
plastic containers like canada's got

324
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,278
more plastic in their container it's

325
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,078
it's crazy so to me there's multiple

326
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:08,879
ways to to stay sustainable and educate

327
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:11,679
and i think that everybody here gave a

328
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:14,399
really great explanation on each parts

329
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:17,120
of their industry so um thank you for

330
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,839
that guys if there's any questions or if

331
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,759
anybody needs to add anything else

332
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,440
go ahead what i want to say is that

333
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,360
especially being in germany and me being

334
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,600
german now we look at the issue right so

335
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,278
we are where you guys have been

336
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,360
obviously we're trying to learn you know

337
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,360
from other like more level market canon

338
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,639
and stuff but at the end of the day

339
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,399
this is this is a giant thing to do like

340
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,639
to legalize a drug yeah you know you

341
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,278
create a market that has been

342
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,958
existing in a regulated form tomorrow's

343
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,559
already there of course you've been part

344
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:49,199
of the of it before

345
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,199
but uh so and there's a lot of fears

346
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,360
obviously and fear is always a bad

347
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,839
advice it might be of course right so

348
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,759
that's uh it goes to the contrary of

349
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,000
what would be sustainable in most of the

350
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:02,879
times

351
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,600
you know you talked about just education

352
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,759
and which you know i'm sure alex was

353
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,000
alluding to it but you know it makes it

354
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,039
very difficult for us to do what we need

355
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,600
to do

356
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,278
when all of our friends and colleagues

357
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,159
are being de-platformed and shadow

358
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:20,720
banned on instagram and facebook

359
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:22,319
um we can't really go out and you know

360
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,000
there's brilliant marketers standing

361
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,680
right there or sitting right there but

362
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,399
you know there's there's there are

363
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,638
creative ways to educate and people love

364
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,039
anecdotal evidence people love to hear

365
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,959
stories when i talk at length about how

366
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,879
i removed gluten dairy and refined sugar

367
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:39,359
and began consuming cannabis and in 60

368
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:42,000
days i healed myself from my psoriasis

369
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,039
or my father came home from florida six

370
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,799
months ago and has a big fat brain tumor

371
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,480
and now he's on two thousand milligrams

372
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,719
of different cannabinoids every single

373
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,399
day and played golf with my son three

374
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,509
weeks ago that [ __ ] is powerful and that

375
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,919
those are the stories

376
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,600
[Applause]

377
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,199
now

378
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,800
do you think george when we're telling

379
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,560
our stories because we spoke about this

380
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:07,120
upstairs which is very important i think

381
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,958
whether it's mental health uh psoriasis

382
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,799
parkinson's all the things that we need

383
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,239
to educate on topics that aren't being

384
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,799
really educated on

385
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,919
i think it's very important and it's up

386
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:20,159
to us to do our due diligence to remind

387
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:23,120
these people that although say what

388
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:25,759
works for you with psoriasis and or with

389
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,440
my adhd and ptsd

390
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,838

391
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,839
one yeah we're an end of one dr deb

392
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,519
camilla said that on in the weeds i give

393

right it's a hundred percent we are in a

396
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,440
new one but and here's the but

397
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,039
you're gonna employ cannabis um you know

398
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,639
i'm just staying in my lane here but

399
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,439
you're an employed cannabis with an

400
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,720
unhealthy diet i'll tell you i don't

401
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,639
even bother spending your money on

402
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,959
cannabis of course cannabis combined

403
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,039
with a healthy lifestyle now we're

404
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,119
talking so that's sort of if you break

405
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:01,198
that back to you know

406
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,039
the soapbox and all the [ __ ] that's on

407
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:05,519
the market where

408
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:07,360
all of its corn set up or some sort of

409
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,278
refined sugar and it's supposed to be

410
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,039
solving for a need state you've got

411
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:13,120
something like refined sugar that's

412
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,719
causing inflammation combining it with

413
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,799
something like cannabis that's supposed

414
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,240
to lower our inflammation and what's the

415
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,319
net result

416
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,360
double negative it's negligible yeah

417
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,800
yeah okay amazing god one thing i'd like

418
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,560
to add to this too it's not a goal

419
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,159
educating the general public is a huge

420
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,838
aspect too but the other thing is as an

421
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,838
industry together we need to educate you

422
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,920
know the politicians and the regulators

423
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,040
that are making these regulations right

424
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,399
a lot of people like to talk and

425
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,000
complain about the regulations that are

426
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,759
being made out there but we need more

427
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
people to be joining the associations

428
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,679
working together as a unit right canada

429
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,720
business as a history comes from unity

430
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,319
and working together to move the

431
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,639
industry forward we need to continue on

432
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,320
that path and not go separate ways or

433
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,440
you know go against each other it's

434
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,199
about working together and you need to

435
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,079
really move forward so if you're not

436
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:55,838
already part of one of your

437
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,078
organizations or associations in your

438
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,920
own state province or country please

439
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:01,519
make sure you do so because that's how

440
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,039
we get this through and that's also how

441
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,360
we will be able to educate even the

442
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:06,399
masses and the people even better is by

443
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,639
pushing it through through the

444
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,958
regulations aspect and that's that's

445
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,399
exactly what we did pre-legalization

446
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,879
like that was the main thing that we did

447
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,480
we united as groups and we fought and we

448
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,879
fought so hard to the point where the

449
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,480
regulators finally broke what i don't

450
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:22,240
understand is when kyle you're making

451
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,240
such an amazing point it just triggered

452
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,919
me what i don't get is now that they

453
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,680
legalized the plant and we've just

454
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,838
accepted every little regulation that

455
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:32,000
they put in 10 milligrams or 10

456
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,000
milligrams into your into your edibles

457
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,440
okay great give somebody sugar diabetes

458
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,360
before they can actually get medicated

459
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,440
from the cannabis there's so many things

460
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,120
that we have just chosen to accept

461
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,360
because they've given us what we wanted

462
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,120
with regulations that no one's fighting

463
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,919
in the house of commons anymore no one's

464
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,759
fighting in the provincial levels i want

465
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,919
all the legal companies to go back the

466
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,278
way the legacy companies fought and

467
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:54,799
fight for the things that they want and

468
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:56,320
change because they're not going to get

469
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,479
in trouble for fighting these things the

470
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,600
worst case scenario it turns out to be a

471
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,519
no if they give a [ __ ] if they care what

472
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,240
does it say here so

473
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,320
whenever big corporations

474
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,639
or marketers come into play they just

475
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,920
[ __ ] it up i mean that's that's true now

476
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,440
i mean

477
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:14,319
at the end of the day

478
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,880
when

479
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,720
your stock price becomes more important

480
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,399
then we deliver back at sustainability

481
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,680
right when your stock price becomes the

482
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,240
most important

483
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:26,078
aspect of your day-to-day operations

484
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,959
then something is wrong in my opinion

485
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:30,719
very very very true so sure and then to

486
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,439
add to education

487
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,720
and we have to fund research yes there's

488
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,800
not enough funding in research do you

489
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,720
have to research because

490
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,240
like i think kind of is a magical plant

491
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,079
but it's only magical because we don't

492
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,240
know how that works yes

493
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,239
right so and there are ways to decipher

494
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,680
this at some point and figure the

495
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,159
positive stuff

496
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,399
what do you need which of the what

497
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:53,759
potentially 500 kind of noise you need

498
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,159
for your helmet yeah you probably won't

499
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,560
need over 500 yes of course right you

500
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,719
got to fight it out and then get a way

501
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,638
for better treatment and distal space

502
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,199
and also for more fun in the rig space

503
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,599
exactly right so and that's that's

504
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,600
amazing

505
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,759
is there anybody that has any questions

506
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,759
for the group

507
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,119
or remarks

508
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:17,679
hand up down

509
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,599
let's go with you what's your name

510
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,280
hi allison just want to say hi to

511
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,279
everyone specifically my lovely

512
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,439
brilliant friend jordan

513
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,038
thank you all for for talking about

514
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,798
these things it's amazing and it's

515
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:30,720
amazing to be in europe i think that's

516
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,960
what most of the canadians on the panel

517
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,798
are articulating and seeing everybody

518
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,240
out of the industry starting to build i

519
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,319
just wanted to touch on what you were

520
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,079
saying about the regulators having sat

521
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:42,960
on the industry association board in

522
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,240
canada and i was privileged to meet with

523
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,880
health canada the head of each

524
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,519
department twice a year and i can

525
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,559
promise you that change

526
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:54,879
probably doesn't come through

527
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:56,720
pushing on regulators as much as it does

528
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,880
from communities just saying we're just

529
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,480
not going to do that yeah and i think

530
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,320
what we saw in canada and i keep

531
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,319
encouraging my european friends here i'm

532
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:06,240
like don't follow all the rules

533
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:08,558
they really there have been very very

534
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,880
few consequences and it's all they're

535
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,960
all very busy and all very

536
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,679
overwhelmed so you would be surprised

537
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,160
where you could find those moments

538
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:22,000
allison's the former ceo of 48 north i

539
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,840
mean she was opp oh amazing allison

540
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,480
thank you very much for that

541
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:28,000
very tough bill

542
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,919
the federal government the federal

543
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,759
regulators and the provincial government

544
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,280
regulators they're nearly impossible to

545
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:34,558
deal with right but i mean and you're

546
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,918
right that

547
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,440
being a community and getting the

548
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,919
message out that way sometimes is the

549
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,279
better way to get progress and just

550
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,200
don't do it or just don't yeah yeah and

551
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,440
kind of push it yeah push the

552
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,440
push the envelope with the rules but i

553
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,880
do believe at some point communication

554
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,558
between the two

555
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,400
of the people pushing the rules and

556
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:55,440
regular regulators there needs to be at

557
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,360
least a

558
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,519
topic of conversation oh there and there

559
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,279
is yeah and there has to be but yeah

560
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:02,879
yeah i'm just saying like as a german we

561
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,399
love rules right so maybe you follow

562
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,559
themselves no don't stop okay i've seen

563
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,360
you have your red lights

564
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,359
i got a question over here

565
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:17,839
has your company

566
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:20,160
developed or looked at or tried to

567
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,279
figure out what to do with what is about

568
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,679
85

569
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:25,839
of the material that's waste that comes

570
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,080
out of the extraction process or are

571
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:31,199
there plans to do that or any thought on

572
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:33,199
that great great great question so

573
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,960
my father is a big mentor of mine and he

574
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,798
does a lot in other recycling industries

575
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,720
especially plastics and so forth and one

576
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:40,079
of his favorite trade sayings is trash

577
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,759
is cash

578
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,960
and um there's a lot of opportunities

579
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:44,400
one of my things i'm most passionate

580
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,079
about with the hemp and the cannabis

581
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,360
plant is you know there's so much that

582
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,199
can be done with this and so many other

583
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,319
building products you know everybody's

584
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,400
heard about you know different building

585
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:53,599
products you know uh hem create you know

586
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,120
insulation

587
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,038
you know the fibers can be utilized in

588
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,959
clothing um and that's an area where

589
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:00,558
it's it's also about you know us pushing

590
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,519
as an industry for these to be adopted

591
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:03,599
more

592
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:05,679
surprisingly a lot of us up here are

593
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,918
more focused on the extraction right now

594
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,919
and growing aspect of the industry but

595
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,520
like some of my very large large large

596
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,880
hemp clients you know a lot of their

597
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:14,558
focus right now there's a lot of

598
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,400
movement going into

599
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:18,240
especially the fiber the herd and

600
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,159
utilizing a lot of that as that starts

601
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,798
to move forward more and more it'll be

602
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,320
easier to adopt offshoots of the from

603
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,158
your industry and find buyers for that

604
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,439
expanded material now one thing i do

605
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,039
want to chime in youtube one of the

606
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,840
beauties of the vapor static extraction

607
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,200
process too is it's like if you put a

608
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,119
if you have like a pax 2 and you put a

609
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,400
little bit of butt in there and you burn

610
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:37,839
it on a light setting and it comes out

611
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,360
like a light brown that's how the

612
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:41,199
material comes out after this it's not

613
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:42,879
like it's being demolished or crushed or

614
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,720
soaked full of solvents and hard to deal

615
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,159
with so from that then too you can

616
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,240
easily take this material and put it

617
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,679
into pelletized feed or other other

618
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,200
options too or even using it as a

619
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,640
fibrous product in you know different

620
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,038
building materials and other things too

621
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,240
so as people are starting to scale and

622
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:58,240
look at how they're building up their

623
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,679
facilities right it's all gonna at the

624
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,359
end of the day margins matter and

625
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,960
optimization matters right but if you

626
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,639
can find value in your waste stream that

627
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,159
helps make you even more profitable

628
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,480
which then allows you to also make

629
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,280
product more affordable to the masses

630
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,120
right so anyways and we're working a lot

631
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:14,158
on a few other things on that aspect and

632
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:17,038
you know maybe we can chat some more

633
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,600
after this as well

634
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:21,679
does anybody else have any oh

635
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:22,719
mr revitch

636
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,038
i feel like you guys are talking about

637
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,400
education i mentioned on the last panel

638
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,079
how there should be some more

639
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,400
consolidation of education i feel like

640
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:33,038
everyone is doing their own education

641
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,960
uh you know as a chef or extraction is

642
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:37,440
there any like associations of cannabis

643
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,200
chefs or or extraction international

644
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,480
that you guys can work on an education

645
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,440
together so that you don't all have to

646
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,798
do the same thing over and over

647
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,480
if there's not you're going to dig it

648
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:48,240
you're going to know what right now no i

649
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,000
mean the fact of the matter is there has

650
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,240
to be some sort of governing body to

651
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,200
issue this certification so who's that

652
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,120
governing body in culinary ideally it's

653
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,679
the culinary schools which is why the

654
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:02,558
american colony of culinary federation

655
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:05,038
has brought a culinary program online

656
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:07,279
and there this this is coming online so

657
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:09,679
from that standpoint i think that

658
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:13,918
cannabis as part of the you know

659
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:16,080
mixology and sort of culinarians journey

660
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:20,320
that will just be table stakes as time

661
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:22,879
goes on for now it's it's you can't be

662
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,798
a certified culinary

663
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,200
cannabis professional there's just no

664
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:29,759
governing body there dude there

665
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,840
definitely does need to be something and

666
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:33,440
i think it will happen in time like

667
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,119
allison said though if we just break the

668
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,960
rules and create our own governing body

669
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,199
it might force them to

670
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,919
allow this scenario that's a heavy lift

671
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,159
my brother okay and added into that too

672
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,440
um one thing is yeah it's not about just

673
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,799
creating like you're saying like

674
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,640
everybody's kind of pushing individually

675
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:51,038
but it's also not about like having a an

676
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,120
extractor's association a culinary chef

677
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,720
organization so in my previous life

678
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:56,079
where i was in plastics as well like i

679
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,558
used to sit on the boards for like the

680
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,720
apr association of plastic recyclers and

681
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,798
navcore as well north american post

682
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,400
consumer recycling organization and in

683
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,000
these organizations what you would have

684
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,919
is on these boards you'd have companies

685
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,440
that were from all the other aspects of

686
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,120
the industry so you have manufacturers

687
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,880
of technology you'd have groups that

688
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,719
focused on testing you have groups that

689
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,039
you know focused on turn those plastics

690
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,279
being into clothing or carpets or

691
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:21,038
bottles or whatever it was and everybody

692
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:23,599
would work together to basically create

693
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,519
a cohesive voice as a sector right and

694
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:28,079
then you put together you know be it

695
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:29,759
like uh you know your recycling cans you

696
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,519
know the number system how to recycle

697
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,200
what is considered a recyclable product

698
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:34,558
what is not considered recyclable we've

699
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,720
got to do that exact same thing here

700
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,720
together but as a unit in unison right

701
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,798
so there are a couple organizations that

702
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,960
are starting but there's also too many

703
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:44,480
if that makes sense right so we gotta

704
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,919
find a way to bring those organizations

705
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,440
together as well

706
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,440
yeah and i think has to do also the

707
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,960
maturity of the market at the end really

708
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,480
right then let's take germany for

709
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,798
instance we have

710
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,640
basically one major industry association

711
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:59,440
and that will cover everything and make

712
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,200
sense because if you legalize cannabis

713
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,200
of course you have to look at hemp yes

714
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,840
of course you have to look at cbd and

715
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,278
all all that right it's it's it's not

716
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:08,480
just an island

717
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:09,839
so from

718
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,519
from us as a

719
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:13,359
economy and as a country you know we

720
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,359
have to have to uh have to have a

721
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,959
holistic approach now

722
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:18,639
but of course in the future this will be

723
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,400
different if you if the market would

724
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,159
choose you have more players

725
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,880
you know if different groups that will

726
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:28,080
form it's just i think it's part of

727
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,679
uh like a natural life cycle too

728
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:32,240
right so

729
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,480
you know it's funny we have this these

730
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,558
content leaders out there and i my mom

731
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,798
raised a mensch so i certainly won't say

732
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:41,200
them by name but you know they curate

733
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:43,359
content that's just incorrect it's just

734
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,600
it's not correct when it comes to how to

735
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,038
infuse culinary or food and beverage

736
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,959
with cannabis

737
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:51,038
and unfortunately you know whether we

738
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,000
want to believe it or not we are still

739
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:55,919
so nascent in many respects in north

740
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,679
america and i live in a federally

741
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,440
legalized environment we have so far to

742
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,440
go in terms of

743
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,200
getting this right and having these

744
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,038
thought leaders at the top of the food

745
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,200
chain who actually know what they are

746
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:12,079
talking about when you have the biggest

747
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,080
of the big information companies that

748
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,119
are slinging all this content and it's

749
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,639
wrong

750
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:18,479
i mean what kind of message are we

751
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,799
sending and then unfortunately you have

752
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,880
a lot of these periphery companies that

753
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:25,278
are out there that are linking to this

754
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,840
sort of mother ship and it all goes back

755
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:29,679
to curating incorrect information and i

756
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,839
think that you know it just speaks to

757
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,880
how nascent we are we'll get there but

758
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:37,038
it's just going to take some time

759
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,120
yeah and i also hope there is a little

760
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:40,400
bit of a cultural difference there

761
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,038
because i think

762
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,960
not you know to you know just

763
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:46,640
hit on all the anglo-saxon america but

764
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,480
american advertising and marketing is

765
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,000
very different from what we do in europe

766
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,839
okay so

767
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,159
yeah so it's it's just like everybody is

768
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:56,158
the best and the biggest and you know

769
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,720
that wouldn't be illegal you know to

770
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,120
have that as a mugging claim in europe

771
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,720
right so and i hope that um

772
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:04,879
well because that's also like like with

773
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,600
us i mean we're very niche product yeah

774
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,360
there's even so much disinformation

775
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,558
they're brought in from other from other

776
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,879
companies that are in the same

777
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:15,278
marketplace about our product

778
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,120
you know it's time to basically say i

779
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,679
have to give like a 45-minute speech

780
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:20,959
just to debunk all that all that

781
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,278
information

782
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,880
yeah so that's and that's also a part

783
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:26,159
you know and i hope that hopefully

784
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,480
hopefully hopefully that europe will be

785
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,400
a little bit different because nobody

786
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,759
everybody everybody wants to grow

787
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,720
but i feel like especially i said

788
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:34,640
everyone should be the best and the

789
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,440
biggest you know and everybody will do

790
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,038
that that's a mantra yeah brand presence

791
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,798
is massive in north america and it's

792
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:42,798
almost problematic to be honest with you

793
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,038
you cannot

794
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:48,798
i was gonna say but you can't lump

795
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,919
canada and the us together because i

796
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:51,679
think our

797
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,240
environment is going to be even more

798
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,159
restrictive than germany and

799
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,759
and we can't even you know it's all

800
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,520
warning labels and you can't really

801
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:02,240
brand market advertising so they're two

802
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:04,240
very different markets but um

803
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,278
yeah i think germany might even be less

804
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,400
strict than canada ultimately i wouldn't

805
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:12,319
bet on that to be honest but uh yeah

806
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,519
because the difference is germany just

807
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:17,439
to your point is that like on a societal

808
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:19,200
level we don't have like a

809
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,558
a wide

810
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,960
public that's for legalization it's

811
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,639
really 50 50. and this divide really

812
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,120
between the young and the old people and

813
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,120
we have a very old society right now so

814
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,719
there's the divider goes right through

815
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:31,759
it and that divider is one of them is

816
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,159
countless

817
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:35,278
right so it's so it will be i think this

818
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,520
is why

819
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,278
also knowing how the legislative process

820
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,200
work and knowing that in our second

821
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:42,798
chamber like what would be u.s senate

822
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,519
when we have the different states

823
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:46,960
um their conservative leadership

824
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:48,398
majority sorry you have a conservative

825
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,079
majority in this

826
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:51,678
so and then you have to make it work you

827
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:52,720
have to go through this second chamber

828
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,038
as well

829
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,880
so i could really see that as being very

830
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:58,240
conservative and also you want to have

831
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,600
to

832
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,200
come back to sustainability when it

833
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:02,879
comes to policy making again so you

834
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,200
don't want to have you want to have a

835
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,200
policy or regular framework that would

836
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,278
not be overthrown by the next government

837
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,679
if there was a change

838
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:14,640
right yes as well so i wouldn't bet that

839
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,320
so i i hope i hope that i'm wrong but i

840
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,759
have fear and i'm german it's not

841
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,720
pessimistic right i'm allowed to be

842
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:20,960
better

843
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,960
so

844
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,599
i'm talking not to the process to get

845
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:27,519
there but when you get there and there's

846
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:30,000
like a pack of cigarettes like this is a

847
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:32,558
german pack of cigarettes right like

848
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,038
what they make you do in canada every

849
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:37,839

same color same pack same font no logo

852
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,880

853
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:46,879
that we have better tobacco lobbyists

854
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:50,240
