1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:12,330
thank you my name is Bridget I'm chief

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:15,359
science officer of pascha brands and how

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:18,240
we look at product development and

4
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,669
commercialization is really kind of

5
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,589
harnessing the essences of craft

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,660
cannabis coming out of small business

7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:28,050
owners that did it just immensely well

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:31,500
in the legacy market and should come in

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:35,759
with their extraction techniques to join

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,159
me on today's panel we welcome Todd de

11
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:43,409
loja who is the president of the zebra

12
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:46,558
brands and Todd has a legacy also of

13
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:50,869
really advocating in doing consulting

14
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:53,578
for medical cannabis policy and

15
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:56,669
representing medical patient users he

16
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,469
had an immense amount of expertise

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,359
working with the Oregon health

18
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:05,939
authorities and how that translated into

19
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:08,969
getting more medical patient access of

20
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,250
course educating the educators and I

21
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:14,340
think that's translated into zebras

22
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,829
business model which will effectively

23
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,010
help cannabis producers get more

24
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:24,090
sustainable practices so thank you very

25
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:29,460
much for being here next on our expert

panel is AC Braddock she is not at all

27
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:37,199
unfamiliar in this sphere as CEO of Eden

28
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:40,550
labs a really prolific cannabis

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,650
extraction firm and technology innovator

30
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:46,729
AC has brought lots of R&amp;D to this space

31
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:50,640
almost 10 years in hardware and

32
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:53,579
processes to bring cannabis cannabinoid

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:58,189
oils to market so thank you okay there

34
00:01:53,579 --> 00:02:01,230
you go 25 years there we have it and

35
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:03,450
she's really representing the heartbeat

36
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:07,650
behind how we're going to get quality

37
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:12,659
products to serve the demand that today

38
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:15,450
is here next in line is market Marcus

00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:23,510
mark has an immense amount of expertise

42
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:26,810
in cannabis extraction science as worked

43
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:28,870
at length with the equipment and is

44
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:33,920
going to give us our insights today on

45
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:36,650
how really we bring the heart of the

46
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:39,079
flower back to formulations that are

47
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,840
carefully put together through chemistry

48
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:45,110
art and also how we're gonna make them

49
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,620
more bioavailable and more attractive

50
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:51,920
for more product diversity so thanks for

51
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:54,770
being here Marcus and last on the panel

52
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:58,059
is of course our representative legal

53
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:04,219
counsel Liam

54
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:07,370
Ulster is an associate at Watson and

55
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:09,859
Gopal so he represents a lot of

56
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,319
commercial and corporate law and I

57
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:15,380
believe he's going to bring to us an

58
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:19,009
examination of how IP and trademarking

59
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:21,139
can create value for your organization

60
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:23,030
especially in acquisitions that he

61
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:25,339
carried out in the cannabis space and

62
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:28,039
we'll talk a little bit about that value

63
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,890
chain when we start to bring this type

64
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:33,919
of technology of formulations out to the

65
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:36,889
global marketplace all right well thanks

66
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:39,189
everybody for agreeing to be here we are

67
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:43,819
going to start by discussing the

68
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:45,439
anticipated extracts regulatory release

69
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:48,530
that we're expecting by Health Canada

70
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:52,280
and other jurisdictions who have coached

71
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:54,379
on the matter in the US and what we can

72
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,569
expect as challenges with those

73
00:03:54,379 --> 00:04:02,359
regulations now recap categorizing

74
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:08,239
extracts edibles and vape products and

75
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:10,700
so Liam let's start you off yeah great

76
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,400
you have your mic so what do you think

77
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:15,289
we are going to anticipate as challenges

78
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,870
or issues with the new extracts

79
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:20,319
regulations and how that will affect

80
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,319
your business

81
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:28,949
adjusting essentially I glad to find the

82
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:31,889
mic is turned on I think the good news

83
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:34,259
is that a lot of businesses who are

84
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:36,689
active in the space have the tools

85
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:38,550
needed and they're already dealing with

86
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:42,949
the problems that the new regulations

87
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:45,810
are going to cause October 17th the

88
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:49,370
supplementary regulations for edibles

89
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:52,500
concentrates extracts there's already

90
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:54,209
drafts of the amendments online we know

91
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,029
what that is going to require of

92
00:04:54,209 --> 00:05:00,000
Canadian industry and the good thing is

93
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:02,250
there's now hard guidelines which means

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,230
businesses can plan around those we know

95
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,620
hard caps about how much can be in

96
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:09,030
individual packages we know what the

97
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,819
regulations are going to require in

98
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:13,469
terms of cleaning the bad news is like

99
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:15,569
all Health Canada regulations

100
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:18,870
I mean they've worked very very hard to

101
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:20,909
advance a specific public health policy

102
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:24,030
agenda and that means there's more

103
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:26,670
onerous requirements on businesses one

104
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:28,589
of the big changes which a lot of

105
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:31,470
businesses aren't planning for today is

106
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:33,419
how it treats ingredients in the new

107
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:36,630
regulations so a lot of people are

108
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,939
needing to treat ingredients which would

109
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:41,819
otherwise not be required to meet the

110
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:44,370
high standards that cannabis is treated

111
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:47,670
inside a facility to that higher

112
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,470
standard which means more cleaning

113
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,840
requirements for equipment that deals

114
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,430
with non cannabis ingredients it means

115
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,409
that it's not just things like your

116
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,269
extraction technology which is going to

117
00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:00,120
need to meet that higher standard it

118
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:02,250
also means that segmented parts of your

119
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,019
equipment production line which don't

120
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,449
touch cannabis are also going to need to

121
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:08,819
meet those higher quality standards it's

122
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,800
a lot of a lot of extra work to meet

123
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:12,000
those additional regulations which means

124
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,620
businesses really need to be thinking

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,779
who they're working with

126
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,269
what experience they have and are they

127
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:21,000
up to date on the regulations right and

128
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:23,549
how to create efficiencies and how

129
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,009
you've documented your practices and how

130
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,379
you stick on that track and how you get

131
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:32,250
off how you recognize when you get off

132
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:35,819
track so Quality Assurance how do we

133
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:39,269
educate our the firms were working with

134
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:44,269
our own business within our LPS Todd how

135
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:46,500
do we look at extraction and

136
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:49,079
efficiencies with quality management

137
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:56,910
supply chain management how do you do it

138
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:59,969
with zebra oh you know we're in this

139
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:02,760
really interesting situation where we're

140
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:06,390
a license to cultivate and extract and

141
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:09,089
in Colombia and and if we wanna you know

142
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:11,879
export to the European market or many of

143
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:15,239
the other markets we have to you know of

144
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:20,329
course meet GMP standards but the unique

145
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,329
thing about Colombian law is we have the

146
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:27,449
requirement to get 10% of our biomass

147
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:29,369
from from small growers and as many

148
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:31,439
people may know you know this the

149
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,449
regulation in Colombia as a result of

150
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:36,959
the peace process between a lot of the

151
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:39,479
old cartels and paramilitaries and so

152
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:43,859
that so the small growers pretty much

153
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:46,980
represents them and and so in order to

154
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:52,100
get a complete you know supply chain of

155
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:56,610
GMP of high quality we're gonna have to

156
00:07:52,100 --> 00:08:00,090
educate and and and help help these

157
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:04,290
smaller producers through to get their

158
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:06,959
production up to GMP sort of actually

159
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:10,189
document what they're doing exactly so

160
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:13,049
we and and not deviate from a work order

161
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:15,629
essentially yeah so fortunately you know

162
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:19,829
I have what a you know background in

163
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:23,668
education so so in and and so we're

164
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:26,338
establishing connections with indigenous

165
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:29,248
growers and and

166
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:31,798
trade associations that are focused on

167
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:33,899
small growers getting involved not just

168
00:08:31,798 --> 00:08:37,078
for the relationships but also to kind

169
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:40,828
of convey this type of education and

170
00:08:37,078 --> 00:08:43,338
training as well as the desire to play

171
00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:45,688
the game and and meet these standards

172
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:48,149
you know for providing economic

173
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:52,078
opportunities to these small growers

174
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:56,179
right right now there's such a demand

175
00:08:52,078 --> 00:08:59,219
for high-quality distillates isolates

176
00:08:56,179 --> 00:09:01,258
across obviously the main ones CBDs

177
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,579
always in hinds immense but as the other

178
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:08,938
cannabinoids come to therapeutic market

179
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:11,818
there's quite the demand so from the

180
00:09:08,938 --> 00:09:15,929
extraction Sciences what can we expect

181
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:18,750
the future of CBD isolates distillates

182
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:25,109
in that market AC why don't you give us

183
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:26,370
your perspective I just want to remind

184
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,860
everybody what we're still in

185
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,659
prohibition and the only reason we're

186
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,750
still talking to and we talk about CBD

187
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:35,129
at all is because of prohibition if we

188
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,208
didn't have prohibition we will be

189
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:37,829
talking about all the different

190
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,808
cannabinoids and all the terpene

191
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:43,888
profiles and we would have products that

192
00:09:39,808 --> 00:09:45,838
are actually medically relevant I'm not

193
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:47,669
a fan of going down this path obviously

194
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,459
it's going to happen but I think it's

195
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:55,110
extremely detrimental to medical

196
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:59,058
applications conscious consumption it's

197
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:04,050
gonna happen but I mean who arguing that

198
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:07,169
full-spectrum oils and formulations are

199
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:10,049
still the hot item to bring from

200
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:12,299
prohibition time or would you be shaping

201
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:15,508
more towards the demand for isolates

202
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:17,818
like the very very first thing that was

203
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:19,259
taken out of a plant because they

204
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:21,088
thought it was the strongest thing out

205
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:24,808
of the plant and this was the best thing

206
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:27,899
to do was in 1805 which set our whole

207
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:30,289
medical industry down this path was

208
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:30,289
morphine

209
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,800
right so is that a viable pathway I mean

210
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,259
why are we not talking about the

211
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:44,149
endocannabinoids system just established

212
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:47,009
1992 that is current medical science

213
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:49,879
going back and taking a plant apart to

214
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:54,000
study it especially clinically will take

215
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:56,100
decades decades right we need to be

216
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,649
doing it from the other side where we're

217
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:02,670
looking at a system treating a system

218
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:07,009
that is real medical science so you

219
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:09,828
would then suggest that if we do

220
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:11,578
extraction from the flower obtain

221
00:11:09,828 --> 00:11:14,819
formulations in the natural health

222
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:17,578
products category how do they come

223
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,230
applicable for clinical work health and

224
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:21,208
wellness work and or even just a

225
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,528
business how's the small business ever

226
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:26,009
going to go through a clinical trial

227
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:28,230
yeah what about the industry right Shan

228
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:29,519
it'll limit access to patients if we can

229
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,589
continue to go down this path

230
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,578
this whole vape pen thing which is

231
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:37,320
really really tragic I think though it

232
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:39,239
in the end it may be better for the

233
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,589
cannabis industry to have differentiated

234
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:45,539
between nicotine and additives and what

235
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:49,529
this industry has been built on and that

236
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:52,439
is whole plant right so mark is quite

237
00:11:49,528 --> 00:11:54,929
over there and I see you nodding so what

238
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,390
what what is your perspective on full

239
00:11:54,929 --> 00:12:00,569
spectrum products you know holding the

240
00:11:57,389 --> 00:12:02,370
quality and making it out well I mean I

241
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,050
have my own opinions on all of these

242
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,209
things of course but I've learned that

243
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:08,009
my opinion well that the industry itself

244
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,869
and that the people that require to

245
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:12,088
access this medicine are bigger than my

246
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:15,149
opinion and so I was like the most

247
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:17,940
hardened water extraction solvent list

248
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:19,708
dry sift most people know me as that guy

249
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,240
now being involved with a company where

250
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:23,219
we're going to be processing all sorts

251
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,769
of different ways it surprises some

252
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:29,069
people but you know for me I see them

253
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:30,220
both having a place I full-spectrum all

254
00:12:29,068 --> 00:12:33,669
the way I am we were

255
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,860
you know dave watson scantron Sam the

256
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:38,289
original breeder from Horta farm who

257
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:41,050
bred the cultivars for GW originally the

258
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:43,509
first CBD cultivars he was the one who

259
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:45,579
taught us in 2000 if you can imagine

260
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:47,710
eighteen to nineteen years ago we were

261
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,240
in his apartment in Amsterdam and he did

262
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,610
this with Ethan Rousseau he did this

263
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,860
with Ed Rosenthal all of the people that

264
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,590
are really leading the conversation in

265
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:59,230
the modulating effects of terpenes came

266
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:00,100
from from Dave he taught us all he was

267
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,259
the one that had all the pure

268
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,690
cannabinoids all the pure terpenes and

269
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:07,149
then sat us down and one by one gave us

270
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:09,730
bong rips with and without terpenes to

271
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:11,860
modulate and that really sort of at that

272
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,480
point in time I became very like these

273
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,430
are the most important they're there

274
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,600
they're so important they're modulating

275
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:19,329
the effects they're creating all these

276
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,060
medicinal components and I kinda was

277
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:23,710
also in the same you know boat as a sea

278
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:25,299
kind of thinking like what do we really

279
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,590
need to separate and isolate everything

280
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:28,240
and I think the more I started learning

281
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:31,509
about the science the more I started

282
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,580
meeting people who were extremely

283
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:36,700
sensitive some of them were Gervase

284
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:38,680
syndrome children gastro Lennox children

285
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,590
extremely sensitive neurological

286
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:43,239
disorders cannabinoids can be extremely

287
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:46,950
beneficial for them whole plant

288
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:50,049
cannabinoids but the problem is is that

289
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:51,820
from grow to grow depending on your

290
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:53,159
terroir depending on how much of your

291
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,110
environment you're controlling

292
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:59,259
little things can change and alter the

293
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:01,389
profile of your terpenes in that known

294
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:03,309
cultivar so now you have a small child

295
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:04,960
she's using this medicine it's working

296
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:07,359
for her after three months she gets a

297
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,879
new crop it's not working the same way

298
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,970
so I see the value from a perspective of

299
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:15,549
taking cannabis apart isolating the

300
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:18,220
components and creating formulations for

301
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:20,709
patients like that that are accurate

302
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:24,100
each and every time and more importantly

303
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:26,350
we don't have to pick sides we we now

304
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,570
can all choose the avenues we want to go

305
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,490
down we can go down full spectrum we can

306
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:33,160
go down distillates and isolates and I

307
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:35,589
think that we just shouldn't spend time

308
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:37,329
working against methods that we don't

309
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:39,250
see eye-to-eye with as much as just

310
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,769
focusing on the methods that we that we

311
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,389
want to

312
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:42,948
promote because this is cannabis and

313
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:46,879
there's literally like a thousand

314
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:48,588
pathways to to take and fortunately in

315
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:49,999
Canada you have multiple different

316
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:52,309
pathways because you also have a

317
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:53,600
nutraceutical pathway which we don't

318
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:56,499
have in the u.s. you actually have a

319
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,689
definition for that here so there's

320
00:14:56,499 --> 00:15:02,569
medical nutraceutical and then there's

321
00:14:59,688 --> 00:15:09,769
also shil conscious consumption or

322
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:14,058
lifestyle but the point I wanted to make

323
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:16,249
too and I'm not against isolates I just

324
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:18,528
think that we should look at everything

325
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:21,409
instead of hyper focusing on something

326
00:15:18,528 --> 00:15:27,409
because of a political situation that

327
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:30,469
we're in but tikkun olam in israel has

328
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:33,469
been doing Studies on CBD for well over

329
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:35,480
a decade and on CBD and they discovered

330
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,829
it has a bell curve it's effective it's

331
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,170
effective it's effective and then it

332
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:41,118
stops being effective and you can add

333
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:43,729
more CBD but it doesn't increase the

334
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:47,178
efficacy it actually starts competition

335
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:49,670
with another canal it has to have a full

336
00:15:47,178 --> 00:15:51,740
plant and once they added that back in

337
00:15:49,669 --> 00:15:53,688
and they found a strain out of Spain

338
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,360
that they utilized and once they add

339
00:15:53,688 --> 00:15:59,448
that back in FSC FSE increased and

340
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,879
stabilized so there's something there

341
00:15:59,448 --> 00:16:04,368
and I just want to make sure that we pay

342
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:08,149
attention to what that is but upon

343
00:16:04,369 --> 00:16:12,079
identifying this ratio say of the

344
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:14,778
synergistic like chemical molecules then

345
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:17,508
you could dial them back into a dose for

346
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:19,938
an application still leaving the

347
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:21,528
heartbeat behind somebody who just wants

348
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:23,509
to take it through a natural health

349
00:16:21,528 --> 00:16:26,149
product right it's very powerful

350
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:27,918
if you bioassay it if you have access to

351
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:30,230
pure cannabinoids and pure terpene

352
00:16:27,918 --> 00:16:34,338
fractions there is no denying the fact

353
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:37,819
that that hitting THC a pure in a pipe

354
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:40,160
is is a very one-dimensional experience

355
00:16:37,818 --> 00:16:43,039
it's very couch lock it's very sedate

356
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,909
'iv but you put a single terpene with

357
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:46,529
that THC a

358
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:49,379
and it is literally like curtains

359
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:51,419
opening up and the whole band showing up

360
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:53,879
which is literally why Ethan called it

361
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:55,759
the entourage effect and I think that's

362
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:59,009
dr. Lester Grinspoon called it the

363
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:02,610
ensemble effect which really no it's

364
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:05,190
profound so lots of companies are going

365
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:07,740
to be investing and trying to be

366
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:11,340
versatile in their tech right to

367
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:14,940
accomplish exactly what we said so what

368
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:18,299
what in your mind right now maybe we'll

369
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:20,250
start with Liam on the acquisition or

370
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:22,139
tech companies that are in in putting in

371
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,509
extraction equipment what where do you

372
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:27,990
put the value what type of extraction is

373
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:30,900
you know leading for large scalable

374
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:32,370
companies yeah I think everyone on the

375
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,560
panel is set it well in their own

376
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:36,299
different way but there's there's a

377
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,269
thousand different ways that you can go

378
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:41,099
in this space companies are valuing very

379
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:43,589
different things based on their values

380
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:45,419
based on their business models based on

381
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:47,809
the people they're working with based on

382
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,860
their partnerships based on the

383
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:51,990
jurisdiction that they're in which

384
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:54,750
wildly changes the regulations they need

385
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:57,450
to comply with so I mean the the short

386
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,920
answer is every business value something

387
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:01,279
different but there are a few common

388
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,570
things which everybody is looking at

389
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:06,690
everybody is looking at integration so

390
00:18:03,569 --> 00:18:08,490
if for example there's a specific

391
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,380
concentration with a specific formula

392
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:12,630
they're looking at how can we use this

393
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:15,960
who can we partner with that this

394
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:17,760
formulation makes sense if it's used in

395
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,950
vape cartridges or if it's given

396
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:22,740
direct-to-consumer or if it's used in

397
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:24,870
some other ancillary derivative product

398
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:28,529
everybody's looking at how they can use

399
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:31,649
different formulas a lot of people are

400
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:33,690
looking at strategic partnerships so who

401
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:35,640
can use this if you work with them who

402
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,200
knows what they're doing who knows how

403
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,270
to maximize the value of this thing

404
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,830
because I can tell you everybody on this

405
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:42,869
panel has a different knowledge of

406
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:44,339
different types of products and they'd

407
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:47,039
all use it very differently in their own

408
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:50,399
business a lot of people are looking at

409
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,079
IP rights so what comes with it a lot of

410
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,000
companies there's nothing magic to their

411
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:56,490
formulas there's no special

412
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,710
concentration they don't have plant

413
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:01,140
breeders rights act rights in

414
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:03,240
any product that they're selling a lot

415
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,600
of people look at what rights come with

416
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,169
it

417
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:09,149
is it a brand name is it from a specific

418
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:11,009
plant that has some interesting genetics

419
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:13,669
a lot of people look at not just the

420
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:17,390
formulation but where it comes from like

421
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:20,130
the sourcing of not just the plants but

422
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:22,830
the producer that carries a lot of

423
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:24,659
weight you have to look at all of it a

424
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:26,308
business has to look at all of these

425
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:29,340
different metrics and find out what

426
00:19:26,308 --> 00:19:29,548
makes sense as part of its business all

427
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:33,209
right

428
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:35,548
so Todd you are actively pursuing

429
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:37,140
partners in different geographies that

430
00:19:35,548 --> 00:19:40,710
will likely have access to different

431
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:43,950
equipment different expertise so where

432
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,240
do you put value back as an aggregate as

433
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,640
you look at all these countries you're

434
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,190
partnering with how do you see the value

435
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:53,700
back in pursuing international

436
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:55,950
partnerships like that well about 95

437
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:59,850
percent of the global cannabis industry

438
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:02,669
is entirely on paper they exist solely

439
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:06,418
on pitch decks and PowerPoint

440
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:08,399
presentations and it's just amazing how

441
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:11,700
some of these companies get you know

442
00:20:08,398 --> 00:20:15,168
tens of million dollar market caps when

443
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:18,210
all they really have are a few L o eyes

444
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:22,080
but yeah so so when I when I read

445
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:25,259
business plans like this you know people

446
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:28,079
who are kind of seasoned in cannabis can

447
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:30,148
can really sniff out the BS like really

448
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:33,148
quick you know if they're you know

449
00:20:30,148 --> 00:20:35,308
saying they're you know producing on you

450
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:37,079
know a couple hundred Hector's but

451
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:41,058
they're running it through a twenty

452
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:46,139
litre co2 extractor there is something

453
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:47,490
amiss there so you know so I look I look

454
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:51,149
at all these business planes and I

455
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:53,970
really look for for a sensible flow you

456
00:20:51,148 --> 00:20:55,619
know some you know something about what

457
00:20:53,970 --> 00:21:00,210
they're doing that that really makes

458
00:20:55,619 --> 00:21:02,668
sense from cultivation inbreeding you

459
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:05,669
know through extraction and and finished

460
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:08,980
product formulation as well as their

461
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:13,480
their distribution as well so in then

462
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:15,880
could you then conclude like how many in

463
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,349
how much inventory is going to come from

464
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,520
that particular producer what would be

465
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:21,428
their yield do you think you'll get

466
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:23,859
better at cutting through you know the

467
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:26,200
BS of you know we've got this square

468
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:29,289
foot we've got this many shifts to get

469
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,450
this product to the secondary processor

470
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:34,149
how do you think you will get more clear

471
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:37,298
on determining that partnership in

472
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:41,470
Columbia actually returning world-class

473
00:21:37,298 --> 00:21:42,519
supply world qualified supply yeah it's

474
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,289
just you know if you get through the

475
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:48,069
executive summary of a business plan I

476
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:49,960
mean that that that's pretty good but

477
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:53,230
it's really just about finding out who's

478
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,808
real you know who really has the expert

479
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,910
you know if they're not actually growing

480
00:21:55,808 --> 00:22:00,819
and extracting and doing their their

481
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:03,730
operations you know do these people have

482
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:05,710
the capacity to do it well

483
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:09,669
you know do they have the track record

484
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:11,440
you know in another industry and and so

485
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:13,840
it's really about going out there and

486
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,640
finding out you know what's real and and

487
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:21,689
what's you know just on on paper so

488
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:25,650
maybe we'll segue a little bit now into

489
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:28,750
technical formulations and the laws that

490
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:32,919
perhaps prohibit them into things like

491
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:38,109
vapes or edibles and then a controversy

492
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:40,929
of certain you know stigma around vape

493
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:44,219
pens being prefaced in California's

494
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:46,840
perhaps leading to illness or even

495
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:48,730
fatalities could I just make one point

496
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:50,769
on what he was saying in regards to your

497
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,870
question on how you see the value of

498
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:54,789
international relationships of course I

499
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:55,899
wanted to and I will go right back to

500
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:57,879
the vape pens but it was a really

501
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:01,169
important point that I wanted to make

502
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:04,030
was for me as an extractor the value of

503
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:06,910
relationships outside of Canada relate

504
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:08,859
directly to terroir and the earth and

505
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:11,290
the ground and all of the environmental

506
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:13,869
details that that plant is growing under

507
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:16,058
and that's why lavender expresses itself

508
00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:17,759
very specially from France it's known as

509
00:23:16,058 --> 00:23:19,230
like the best lavender in the world

510
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,450
and cannabis isn't going to be any

511
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:24,450
different and places like Colombia and

512
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:26,340
in Thailand and Jamaica have for many

513
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,048
decades been known to produce nice

514
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:30,509
cannabis but there are going to be some

515
00:23:28,048 --> 00:23:33,089
places in the world where novel

516
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:34,829
cannabinoids and and terpenes are

517
00:23:33,089 --> 00:23:37,798
produced where they won't be produced

518
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:39,750
elsewhere and in a tropical environment

519
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:41,730
where the cultivars are narrow leaf drug

520
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:44,460
cultivars rather than the wide leaf drug

521
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:46,019
cultivars those are also you know part

522
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,048
of prohibition and the problem with

523
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:50,609
prohibition is that the greedy

524
00:23:48,048 --> 00:23:53,158
prohibition mindset of how much can I

525
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:55,769
get and how fast can I get it cut out

526
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:58,679
narrow leaf drug cultivars and and made

527
00:23:55,769 --> 00:24:01,589
an empath way for wide leaf cultivars

528
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,298
indicas and so we lost a lot of novel

529
00:24:01,589 --> 00:24:05,369
cannabinoids we lost a lot of novel

530
00:24:03,298 --> 00:24:07,558
terpenes those exotic flavours that only

531
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:10,739
have to be able to measure them in those

532
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:12,658
places that they were cultivated and

533
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,490
that legacy was there to build lots of

534
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,710
it so I will tell you not all countries

535
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,690
have labs I can test this stuff you

536
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:21,210
can't necessarily ship it around to get

537
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:23,038
mass spec you'd be amazed I've been like

538
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,929
Jamaica which is definitely has much

539
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,388
less of an infrastructure than Colombia

540
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:29,759
they have two proton NMR zat the

541
00:24:27,388 --> 00:24:31,829
University of West Indies like that's

542
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,679
like proton NMR czar likely right but

543
00:24:31,829 --> 00:24:38,250
you also need expertise on identifying

544
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:40,230
new phyto cannabinoid you knows features

545
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:43,079
I think where you're going though is

546
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:45,480
maybe the value is on actually getting

547
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:48,599
research collaboration so that samples

548
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,490
can actually travel so that we can study

549
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:54,359
them to that nature to see if there are

550
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:57,089
any differentiating products in G Egypt

551
00:24:54,359 --> 00:25:02,308
Lebanon versus the cultivars that would

552
00:24:57,089 --> 00:25:04,500
be here right and if that has some value

553
00:25:02,308 --> 00:25:06,119
to then partner across universities and

554
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,119
other places then you now have some IP

555
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:12,479
perhaps associates with it yeah up until

556
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:15,148
this point we've seen cultivation go

557
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,630
where the legalization opportunities are

558
00:25:15,148 --> 00:25:21,509
and now that that legalization is is

559
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:24,120
going across the globe we're seeing the

560
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:27,359
cultivation go to where cultivation is

561
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:29,398
best and so there there are some

562
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,879
countries like Colombia that that have

563
00:25:29,398 --> 00:25:32,279
very

564
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,220
I'm good was in terms of being able to

565
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:37,859
grow a lot of cannabis and they in

566
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:40,440
Colombia also has several climate zones

567
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:42,629
as well and then there is going to

568
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,269
places you know you know Jamaica

569
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:46,860
Caribbean islands Southeast Asia

570
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:49,410
going to different places in the world

571
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:51,599
that may not see the best opportunities

572
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:55,350
for broad scale cultivation but you

573
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:57,359
could find those unique bars yeah where

574
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:59,009
then maybe you need now extraction

575
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:01,229
technologies with the right chemistry

576
00:25:59,009 --> 00:26:03,690
output that at least you get a high

577
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:05,400
quality resin that can be further

578
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:09,659
distilled and then characterized

579
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:11,700
specified right okay so we identify new

580
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:14,610
things we can mix them we can build

581
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:17,460
partnerships that could bootstrap you

582
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:19,589
know commercial value to it what what's

583
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:23,159
the next wave like what do we have to do

584
00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:25,589
to cannabinoids to get them you know out

585
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:28,049
commercially let's let's talk about some

586
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:30,928
of most multiplication techniques what

587
00:26:28,048 --> 00:26:33,150
do you think the next wave is I mean I

588
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:35,038
think nano emulsification is definitely

589
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:36,990
a cool way to get cannabinoids that are

590
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:39,450
otherwise non soluble in liquid to be

591
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:43,019
able to disperse properly I first saw it

592
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:44,340
as a liposome based nanoparticle and

593
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:46,349
then I saw the mesial based

594
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:49,259
nanoparticles and each one seemed to

595
00:26:46,349 --> 00:26:51,599
create more of a bioavailability the

596
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:54,029
onset is very quick and I think that

597
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,529
people will enjoy you know drinking

598
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:58,230
cannabinoids do you think they're all

599
00:26:55,529 --> 00:26:59,940
kind of all of those technologies are so

600
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:03,058
similar it's gonna be hard to figure out

601
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:04,919
what really is real what what really

602
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:06,839
could be a game-changer for availability

603
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:09,780
and different issues sure the cream will

604
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:11,579
rise to the crop as it always does just

605
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:13,139
like he said earlier Todd said earlier

606
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:16,379
it's it's about trying to find out who's

607
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:18,059
real sure like sure being that for a

608
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,400
couple but these companies in California

609
00:27:18,058 --> 00:27:22,168
have been building these nano

610
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,240
emulsification they're there's not many

611
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:27,419
more waters in California that I would

612
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,669
say are amazing because I can drink an

613
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:33,270
emulsified formulation of can i you know

614
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:34,440
cannabinoids in my water what like what

615
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:35,450
do you think it really needs to pull it

616
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,940
ahead

617
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:41,330
does it is it more bench science is it

618
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,110
more scale abilities a more QA you know

619
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:44,599
qa/qc

620
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:46,909
I mean personally I think it's about

621
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:48,409
like maybe convincing people that THC

622
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:50,570
isn't dangerous and that you don't have

623
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:52,100
to protect your children from it like

624
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:53,990
they still haven't come out from the

625
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:56,329
massive lie that this is a dangerous

626
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:58,730
compound and they still want to protect

627
00:27:56,329 --> 00:28:02,750
it like it's it's just plutonium or

628
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:05,808
something we lied we were just we just

629
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:07,759
wanted to arrest brown people and do all

630
00:28:05,808 --> 00:28:09,349
the heinous things that they did under

631
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,629
prohibition which they've continued to

632
00:28:09,349 --> 00:28:14,869
do in which AC mentioned earlier they're

633
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:17,000
still doing today well we talked about

634
00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:19,308
this try not to forget that this is not

635
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,230
legal all around the world for everyone

636
00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:23,058
and there's still people even in

637
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:25,460
California having their doors kicked

638
00:28:23,058 --> 00:28:28,490
down and having all of their you know

639
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:33,319
their their businesses destroyed so this

640
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:35,509
is a reality that we're in still it's

641
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:38,869
astounding what prohibition and that

642
00:28:35,509 --> 00:28:42,579
propaganda that came out of early 1930s

643
00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:45,949
in the u.s. did to the entire world's

644
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:49,609
perception of cannabis it's astounding

645
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:52,120
and it's well we are they lacked the

646
00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:55,428
education and/or knowledge to decouple

647
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:57,289
potency against THC I mean we're all

648
00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:59,509
gonna say that you know I've smoked or

649
00:28:57,289 --> 00:29:01,308
had extracts that had waited to the

650
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:04,670
other families of cannabinoids and I

651
00:29:01,308 --> 00:29:06,710
still feel high I stole so that linkage

652
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:10,130
of potency or

653
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:13,069
our impairment has got to be decoupled

654
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:15,260
from the word or the acronym THC and I

655
00:29:13,069 --> 00:29:17,689
think the question about you know new

656
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:19,819
technology isn't is an interesting one

657
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:21,799
but you know we've been doing

658
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:24,200
extractions for on multiple different

659
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:27,319
kinds of things for a really long time

660
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:29,390
and I have talked about extractions on

661
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:32,629
multiple multiple different panels for

662
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:37,790
years but what I find interesting now is

663
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:40,160
not how but why but why are you gonna do

664
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:42,889
it that way what what social ill is that

665
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:46,700
we're curing what what is your mission

666
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:47,960
as a company you know why would why are

667
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:52,660
you gonna do it like that

668
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:54,980
and what I would like to see as a

669
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:59,360
improvement into this industry is

670
00:29:54,980 --> 00:30:02,809
coupling it with natural products so we

671
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:04,939
have I mean there are two hockey stick

672
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:07,849
industries and we suffer from the same

673
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:10,490
prejudices from big farm and from

674
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:14,629
multiple other areas and if we can get

675
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:18,049
together as one unified plant medicine

676
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:20,500
plant nutrition industry we would have

677
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:25,069
tremendous power and think of the

678
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:29,000
products I mean marrying cannabis with

679
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:31,579
ginger for nausea huge but are we seeing

680
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,140
much of that I mean I'm shocked really

681
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:37,069
that I'm not saying more of it right

682
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:38,600
right so on September 4th actually

683
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:41,089
Health Canada did put out a consultation

684
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:42,889
of which we could consult back on

685
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,839
somewhat of these issues will call them

686
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:46,670
cannabis health products how could they

687
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:49,069
be put to market without a practicum

688
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:51,800
Medical Practitioners oversight so we

689
00:30:49,069 --> 00:30:54,169
did voice but now that's got to get

690
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:58,389
digested and roll out as some kind of

691
00:30:54,170 --> 00:31:01,460
standard policy that could either

692
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:03,230
alleviate risk or help products really

693
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:05,960
get to market that we're done you know

694
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:07,640
in a in a document in traceable way yeah

695
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,769
well it might help them understand and

696
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,440
get over at treating cannabis with you

697
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:14,210
know that's not molecular eyes done to

698
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,220
CBD or something else that's you know

699
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:18,410
has all the danger components taken out

700
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:21,170
and just recognizes like something

701
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:23,870
slightly advanced and you know we can

702
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:26,000
create policy around plants instead of

703
00:31:23,869 --> 00:31:28,039
separating them all out into ones that

704
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:36,559
are more dangerous than other what we do

705
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:40,339
to a maple syrup maybe we'll go to the

706
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:42,859
audience please nothing be and maybe

707
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:44,389
kick out a few questions for us all

708
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,559
right there's a question over here we're

709
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,600
still over here then we'll work our way

710
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:47,888
down here

711
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:52,259
come herecome let's hear it again for

712
00:31:47,888 --> 00:31:52,258
the panel very informative entertaining

713
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:59,230
good afternoon

714
00:31:55,869 --> 00:32:01,898
how important is high CBD hemp gonna be

715
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:06,490
to your industry to provide broad

716
00:32:01,898 --> 00:32:09,538
spectrum about high CBD products well I

717
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:14,669
would you know as a plant breeder you

718
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:17,259
know when we say high CBD cannabis

719
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:22,000
hopefully you were also we're thinking

720
00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:23,740
of other phytochemicals as well so so

721
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,148
right now a lot of the breeding effort

722
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:31,359
is going to spiking that CBD level as

723
00:32:28,148 --> 00:32:35,319
high as we can and no THC level as low

724
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:39,369
as we can but it's it's the innovative

725
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:42,460
breeders that are also looking to look

726
00:32:39,369 --> 00:32:44,528
at all of the the terpene levels in in

727
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:48,730
their breeding and not just looking at

728
00:32:44,528 --> 00:32:50,440
the the high CBD and a low THC so so I

729
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:53,649
think as we as we go

730
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:58,798
keep on engaging in research with with

731
00:32:53,648 --> 00:33:01,418
CBD crops we'll discover a genetic and

732
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:05,259
phytochemical relationships that may be

733
00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:08,909
unique to to some higher what we call

734
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:12,700
higher CBD plants that may be unique

735
00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:15,460
compared to high THC plants or or that

736
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:18,340
express themselves in different ways in

737
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:20,879
different climates and such so so yeah

738
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:23,250
we need to really be thinking way beyond

739
00:33:20,878 --> 00:33:25,658
those two cannabinoids

740
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:28,509
yeah and it's it's a real problem right

741
00:33:25,659 --> 00:33:30,759
now and I can tell you from getting you

742
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:33,669
know supplying these extraction systems

743
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:36,009
to help companies that a lot of them are

744
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:37,538
not doing extractions what's happening

745
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:40,240
is they're finally starting to get

746
00:33:37,538 --> 00:33:43,720
harvests in and a lot of them are hot

747
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,909
and they're trying to figure out how to

748
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,620
remediate out that THC and because a lot

749
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:49,360
of these you know because the points

750
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:53,528
been made they're grown in different

751
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:55,028
places they do different things and they

752
00:33:53,528 --> 00:33:55,538
go through milling process what I'm

753
00:33:55,028 --> 00:33:57,700
saying

754
00:33:55,538 --> 00:33:58,950
yeah I mean it's a it's a problem to

755
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,149
just be sitting there

756
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:02,220
focusing on this one can I don't wait

757
00:34:00,148 --> 00:34:05,388
for multiple reasons but and you know

758
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:07,798
the whole 0.3 is like so arbitrary I

759
00:34:05,388 --> 00:34:13,559
mean where did that come from it's

760
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:15,358
stupid stupid I'll also say I would say

761
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:17,549
more than any other question that I get

762
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:18,898
asked those of you in the room like

763
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:20,429
don't raise their hands but a lot of you

764
00:34:18,898 --> 00:34:21,480
have asked me questions about this this

765
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:23,639
weekend

766
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:26,280
I get asked about the industrial hemp

767
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:28,820
regulations in Canada and the arbitrary

768
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,839
cutoff of the 0.3 percent THC content

769
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:32,760
what parts of the plant you need to

770
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:35,898
process or license for it's a ridiculous

771
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:41,250
system I mean the the reality is that

772
00:34:35,898 --> 00:34:43,190
high CBD low THC plant matter has very

773
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:45,659
specific uses but it's regulated in a

774
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:47,849
incredibly complicated way with very

775
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:49,200
specific restrictions on use and

776
00:34:47,849 --> 00:34:51,000
business has to deal with the

777
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,189
consequences and it makes my life a lot

778
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,858
harder and I know everyone in this room

779
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:58,139
it makes your life so hard or - there

780
00:34:55,858 --> 00:35:00,269
are some states in the US where the the

781
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:03,000
regulatory bodies don't understand it so

782
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:04,380
much in the in the law enforcement don't

783
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,568
understand it that when their fields

784
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:12,559
come up hot they have required to burn

785
00:35:06,568 --> 00:35:12,559
them instead of remediating it's nuts

786
00:35:14,059 --> 00:35:21,480
okay so my question is when we talk

787
00:35:18,989 --> 00:35:24,568
about industrial hemp that's cleaning up

788
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,940
dirty nutrients in the soil what happens

789
00:35:24,568 --> 00:35:30,420
to that dirt dirty nutrients and that

790
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:32,550
dirty and you're talking about the phyto

791
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,559
remediate of properties of cannabis of

792
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:37,079
hemp because camp has been known to

793
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:39,119
remove radioactive nucleotides out of

794
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:41,220
soils so it really is up to the

795
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,510
integrity of who's planting that hemp

796
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:43,949
what are they doing with it are they

797
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:46,140
burning it and glass off' eyeing the ash

798
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:48,539
or they like throwing it into a river

799
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:50,608
because as you know a lot of different

800
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:52,949
people do a lot of different things so

801
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:55,500
the question really is we know that

802
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:57,598
these are dirty properties but we're not

803
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:01,318
regulating against it we're regulating

804
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,730
so vigorously against THC listen we're

805
00:36:01,318 --> 00:36:04,619
not regulating on things that really

806
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:06,000
matter to our health as well no if we

807
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:07,800
were regulating things that really

808
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,088
matter to our health we would regulate

809
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,590
the air that we breathe in the water

810
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:13,170
that we drink and the food

811
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:15,510
that we consume on a daily basis but

812
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:17,369
everything has been so deregulated and

813
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:19,350
lets everyone complain about cannabis

814
00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:21,269
regulations now and deregulate them too

815
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:22,969
so we can go buy hot dog water at a gas

816
00:36:21,269 --> 00:36:26,219
station that burns a hole in our lung

817
00:36:22,969 --> 00:36:29,489
and we also have to understand exactly

818
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:33,719
what remediation is a bioremediation is

819
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:36,750
- you know so some some things that the

820
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:39,929
plant will absorb that toxic molecule

821
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:41,880
into you know but but others it's it's a

822
00:36:39,929 --> 00:36:43,619
full transformation a lot of times it's

823
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,450
not even the plant that's doing the

824
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:47,819
transformation it's the soil microbes

825
00:36:45,449 --> 00:36:50,759
that associate with the plant so

826
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,720
actually some of some toxins depending

827
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,660
on what you're talking about

828
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:57,689
um can be completely just disappeared

829
00:36:54,659 --> 00:37:00,000
and and and and reconstructed but some

830
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:02,579
of them you know the more radioactive

831
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,429
types get you know and and of course

832
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:08,250
those types we don't want to enter into

833
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:13,049
our food chain you know it's appropriate

834
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:15,360
to grow fiber hemp as a way to buy or

835
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:18,080
mediate soil we shouldn't be bio

836
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:21,420
retaining soil that goes into any

837
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,579
consumable fiber hemp especially for

838
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,380
industrial purposes is is very

839
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:27,779
appropriate for that so we really have

840
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:30,539
to understand what do we mean by bio

841
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,340
remediation and what types of cannabis

842
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:34,829
crops were most appropriate for bio

843
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:36,930
remediation if you want a quick little

844
00:37:34,829 --> 00:37:39,179
history lesson how phytoremediation in

845
00:37:36,929 --> 00:37:42,269
cannabis was discovered was in Canada in

846
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:44,519
1994 when Joe Strobel a tobacco farmer

847
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:46,650
tobacco farmers notoriously spray their

848
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:49,139
tobacco with a radioactive nucleotide

849
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:50,940
called radium 226 so he had been

850
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:53,250
spraying his field with the radium 226

851
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,900
and him and Geoff crime the lawyer that

852
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:57,599
got the license they they got the first

853
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,730
license in Canada in 1994 before all of

854
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,279
us we all got our licenses the next year

855
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:04,170
like for other groups and they measured

856
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,550
the field which they're forced to do for

857
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:07,440
these tobacco fields and they measure

858
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:09,420
the radioactive levels and they found

859
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,490
out that the levels were shockingly low

860
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,559
and they were like where did it go and

861
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:15,989
they looked over at the hemp and not

862
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:17,519
actually birth the idea of a company

863
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:19,529
called consolidated growers and

864
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:21,309
processors where we went it was a

865
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:23,560
company I was a part of we went

866
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:26,710
planted a hemp in Chernobyl to remove

867
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:29,860
radioactivity out of the soil there it

868
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:31,809
was absolutely working that's fantastic

869
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:34,480
we're I think we're out of time we are

870
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:36,009
we are very much thank you all very much

871
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,039
let's hear it for Bridget Simon's of the

872
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:41,300
rest of the panel here very informative

873
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:41,300
