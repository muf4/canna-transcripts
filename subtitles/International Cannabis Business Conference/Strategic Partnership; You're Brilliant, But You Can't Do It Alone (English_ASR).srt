44
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:26,359
compliance officer at simplify we're a

45
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:29,090
regulatory compliance software that

46
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,590
helps cannabis businesses really follow

47
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,110
the regulations and kind of stay in

48
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:35,269
operational compliance and then my night

49
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,310
job is I do public policy and government

50
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:39,799
affairs in the cannabis regulatory

51
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,659
market I do i implemented legalization

52
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:44,450
on behalf of the state of Colorado and

53
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:46,310
now do public policy with NCI a and

54
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:50,000
really cannabis businesses all over the

55
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:52,310
country on regulatory matters perfect so

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,860
it's kind of joking we all can't be all

57
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,739
things and when we work hard to form our

58
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,849
organizations we have to look and

59
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:01,159
identify what are our individual

60
00:02:58,848 --> 00:03:02,449
strengths and what are our weaknesses

61
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:05,329
and that's a hard thing for a lot of

62
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:07,310
people to address so we thought we would

63
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:09,230
start by talking about how each of our

64
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,000
organizations were formed and where we

65
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:14,268
look for strategic partnerships in our

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,699
formations for me I'm an herbalist I'm a

67
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:20,120
visionary philosopher I'm customer

68
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:22,518
service I am the team development kind

69
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,349
of vision person but a really big

70
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,439
weakness for me was the business office

71
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:30,108
the financials the accounting and lucky

72
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:32,568
me my business partner and husband is an

73
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:34,670
ex CFO and controller in the utility

74
00:03:32,568 --> 00:03:36,108
industry so when we formed our Herbal

75
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:38,208
Products company it was a real great

76
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:39,469
partnership we really balanced kind of

77
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:42,739
the front of the house in the back of

78
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:44,379
the house and have a great balance but I

79
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:47,120
wanted to open it up to the panel in

80
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:48,709
forming your organization's what were

81
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,019
some of the strategic partnerships that

82
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:54,019
you guys all look for in how you formed

83
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:56,299
your organizations so I was really

84
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:58,700
fortunate I lived just down the street

85
00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:00,939
from Aspen Colorado and as many of you

86
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:05,539
may know Aspen is a fairly affluent

87
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:08,389
community and because of that I had had

88
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:11,199
a small medical concerned and in 2014

89
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:13,849
when we started a recreational business

90
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:16,788
basically went beating the streets and

91
00:04:13,848 --> 00:04:18,240
came up with my now partner I should say

92
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:23,349
my very

93
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:26,470
just recently ex-partner and he came

94
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:31,830
from Wall Street hedge fund background

95
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:35,350
and really brought a different or a

96
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:38,589
really unique perspective on how to run

97
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:42,129
a business and was very complementary to

98
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:44,799
what I did which was grow cannabis and

99
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:48,000
sell cannabis and so to have somebody

100
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,710
with a real solid financial background

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,790
really made our company dynamic and

102
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:57,159
really let us move forward well I'm kind

103
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:59,379
of the cannabis virgin I've been in the

104
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,710
industry for 10 months my background was

105
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:04,379
I ran a tech company here in Portland

106
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:07,029
prior to that I ran school abroad and

107
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:09,339
most notably I helped mark models build

108
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:11,439
Hollywood entertainment I got into

109
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:14,500
cannabis because I really hated the

110
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,969
hypocrisy of what was happening and I

111
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,189
thought I could make a difference our

112
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,410
company was well on its way we were

113
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:23,860
about two years into it when I joined

114
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:26,380
although we were a case of maybe too

115
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,300
much money and and not enough thought

116
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:29,860
and so we really over the last year have

117
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,360
been in a process of rebuilding our

118
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,990
company and so the strategic

119
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:38,680
partnerships were critical to what we

120
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:40,300
did in this last 11 months most of our

121
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,300
agreements most of the things we did

122
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,000
were very old school they were on the

123
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,000
back of a napkin with a yellow crayon

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,220
and we had to put solid structure in

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,040
place in order to grow where we wanted

126
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,410
to do and and have the foundation we

127
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,150
were operating without a mission we had

128
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:01,540
no values we didn't have a vision

129
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:02,949
statement we had no brand and so

130
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,110
establishing all of those things over

131
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:07,389
the last month our investors like to say

132
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,620
that we remodeled the houses we just we

133
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:10,779
chose to live in the house as we

134
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,870
remodeled it but those strategic

135
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:15,759
partnerships are the only way that we

136
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,629
were able to survive and that's with our

137
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,879
attorneys that's with our PR firm

138
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:22,680
that's with our vendors everybody

139
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,649
through there it's creating those

140
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,509
relationships and those partnerships of

141
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:32,969
those people which was so critical to

142
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:35,399
our success today Hey

143
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,020
so I guess in founding simplify the

144
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,799
compliance software company that I

145
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:40,199
worked for now

146
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,699
I was literally nothing just a policy

147
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,379
nerd that had done a lot of government

148
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:45,329
affairs and kind of advising cannabis

149
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:47,939
businesses on operational compliance and

150
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:49,949
had this vision an idea for a software I

151
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:53,279
just had no idea how to create a company

152
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:55,620
or found a company or raise money or

153
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,729
build any kind of tech platform one of

154
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,620
the things I like to say is we're

155
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,490
simplifying and the first one of the

156
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,050
first things I learned about the tech

157
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,030
companies you're supposed to make up a

158
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,500
word but it has to sound like another

159
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:06,569
word when you're like starting a tech

160
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,310
company so I literally knew nothing

161
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:11,459
about anything I just had this vision

162
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:13,829
and understood cannabis regulation at a

163
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:16,019
very fundamental level and so I was very

164
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:17,879
fortunate that Christian Cedarburg the

165
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:20,490
partner of the law firm I I still work

166
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,889
with had a friend who's now our CEO

167
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,300
Marian and we sat in a conference room

168
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:26,639
one day very casually and he was like

169
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,740
you can trust this guy he's retired he's

170
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,800
sold five companies already all tech

171
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,329
platforms for the most part explained to

172
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,879
him your idea and our company was born

173
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:37,169
that day and he's like I'm coming out of

174
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,120
retirement to run this company and so

175
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:40,650
the first strategic partner that I think

176
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,110
I found and like a lot of people have

177
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:45,569
said is the kind of into your gang the

178
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,910
balance to your equation where you know

179
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:49,529
not I know I can't do everything there's

180
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:52,290
a lot of things in our company I can't

181
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:54,599
do and finding those people that are

182
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:56,280
really able to kind of complement your

183
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,810
skill set and balance out even at the

184
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,609
very initial phase before you even start

185
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,899
figuring out who your lawyer and who

186
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,520
your accountants going to be you need to

187
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:04,589
think about your executive team here

188
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:06,779
your top people and who's going to

189
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:08,310
balance out the skills there and then

190
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:09,629
you bring on additional strategic

191
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,000
partners to kind of compliment those

192
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:13,709
folks now I think that's a great point

193
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,360
especially for a lot of us that are

194
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:18,000
founders and have a vision is

195
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,439
recognizing you know who can compliment

196
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,670
that and sometimes that means that even

197
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,620
though you're the founder you're not

198
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:25,140
meant to be the CEO to run the

199
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,090
organization to have it become a healthy

200
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,439
entity and I remember once somebody

201
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,019
saying just because you're a really good

202
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,160
plumber

203
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:32,079
doesn't mean you know how to run a

204
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,599
plumbing business so just because you're

205
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,250
a great cultivator doesn't mean you're

206
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,649
gonna know how to run a cultivating

207
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,538
business so go to what you love because

208
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:41,799
you're gonna be doing it 90 hours a week

209
00:08:40,538 --> 00:08:44,229
give or take

210
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:45,639
so put your heart and soul and where

211
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:47,230
your passion is and then surround

212
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:49,750
yourself with really powerful people

213
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:52,028
that can help you get that vision out

214
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,649
there so sometimes that's hiring the

215
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:55,539
right people to join your team and

216
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:58,000
sometimes it's going outside of your

217
00:08:55,539 --> 00:09:00,909
organization and really looking for a

218
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,549
partner maybe an independent contractor

219
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:06,759
a key you guys already hit on all this

220
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:08,528
attorneys software companies you know

221
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:10,269
especially in the the land of compliance

222
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:11,500
we're really relying on a lot of third

223
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:13,870
parties to really make sure our

224
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,549
businesses are successful and for me

225
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,500
when we really wanted to launch sun-god

226
00:09:15,549 --> 00:09:19,778
medicinals finally up into the Portland

227
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,028
market I really needed a delivery and

228
00:09:19,778 --> 00:09:23,409
logistics company I really believe in

229
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:25,929
account management you know it's an

230
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:28,059
herbal products company extracting 50

231
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:29,620
different herbs and plants there's a lot

232
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:31,838
of Education that we need to provide our

233
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,659
bud tenders and people out there in the

234
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,790
market but I needed a logistics company

235
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:38,620
to actually deliver those products when

236
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:41,110
we chose to partner with dream field up

237
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,639
here in Portland because they could help

238
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:46,149
me get that product out there but still

239
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,230
keep my Account Manager vision going can

240
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:49,149
you guys give up everybody in the

241
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,399
audience maybe a little example of a

242
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:53,259
strategic partner that you've chosen

243
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:56,879
that was outside of your area of

244
00:09:53,259 --> 00:10:02,860
expertise and how you made that decision

245
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:05,649
so I was again real fortunate I had a in

246
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:08,259
Colorado several different legal firms

247
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:11,799
that we could have gone to you for legal

248
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:15,370
advice and had talked to several people

249
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:19,769
about the best people to go to and we

250
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:23,159
ended up with a firm that has done

251
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:25,838
amazing things for our company and I

252
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:28,000
can't say enough about having good legal

253
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,130
representation if you're getting into

254
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,549
this business it will be one of the

255
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:34,458
cornerstones of your bill

256
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:36,679
it has to be and you have to have people

257
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:38,599
that you trust and people that you can

258
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:40,969
depend on and people you can call on a

259
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,879
Sunday afternoon and go how am I going

260
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:46,278
to deal with this so I would say for me

261
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:48,320
that was one of the most important

262
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:53,230
strategic partnerships we were able to

263
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:56,390
for him oh my gosh there were so many

264
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:59,269
you know in in tech your circle is very

265
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:01,278
wide and what I found in cannabis it was

266
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:04,909
very very got an error or an error and

267
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:06,889
there was a lot of distrust and when we

268
00:11:04,909 --> 00:11:08,149
were trying to build partnerships it was

269
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:10,009
like well I'm gonna need to be paid in

270
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:11,419
advance or I'm gonna need this it was

271
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:15,049
you know didn't realize how many people

272
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:17,240
had gotten burned and I saw that as an

273
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:19,009
opportunity I would say probably the

274
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:23,778
biggest strategic partner we have is

275
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:27,019
with ffv extracts we were really good at

276
00:11:23,778 --> 00:11:29,240
growing we have great genetics we can

277
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:32,000
produce a lot of marijuana that's all

278
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,889
wonderful but being able to turn it into

279
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,659
other products and so I think building

280
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:37,669
that partnership with that with an

281
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:40,039
extract company and you know they wanted

282
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:41,809
to date for a long time before they

283
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:43,129
would do business with us and one of the

284
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:46,639
commitments that I've made with all of

285
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:48,379
our vendors is we pay our bills and we

286
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,429
don't overextend ourselves and we pay

287
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:51,620
our bills when we say we're gonna pay

288
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:53,208
our bills and I go through with my

289
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,370
Director of Finance every week and we go

290
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:56,778
through a P and we pay our business and

291
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,480
I think they were pretty surprised by

292
00:11:56,778 --> 00:12:00,679
that I think that's really important

293
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,920
when you're developing and building

294
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:06,769
strategic partnerships that that you

295
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,328
don't burn people and that you you keep

296
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:11,299
those tight and you build those

297
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:17,599
relationships because they will pay huge

298
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:19,039
dividends down the road I guess I get to

299
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,389
come at this panel from kind of two

300
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,069
different directions because sometimes

301
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:23,958
I'm the strategic partner and sometimes

302
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:26,209
I'm looking for a strategic partners so

303
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:28,879
I guess just to be different I'll take

304
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:30,259
the other angle is when I'm acting as a

305
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,028
consultant when I'm what I'm providing

306
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:34,879
policy guidance or government affairs

307
00:12:32,028 --> 00:12:36,679
work from the consultants perspective I

308
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,838
think it's it's important to understand

309
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:40,870
that it's it's really a relationship

310
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,850
that needs to be bilateral and early

311
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:45,100
ship that needs to function bilaterally

312
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:48,550
not just in an economic sense but in an

313
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:50,710
interpersonal sense and so you know my

314
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:52,240
my high level thought here is that what

315
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,860
you really need to be doing is find the

316
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,080
consult and find that strategic partner

317
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,580
that makes sense that fits in with the

318
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,800
ethos of your organization with your

319
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,629
personality and understands where you're

320
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:03,099
going there's a ton of consultants in

321
00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:04,720
this space I think it's you know one of

322
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,310
the con going jokes in this industry is

323
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,370
how quickly the consultants kind of seem

324
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:11,229
to multiply and grow and and the

325
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,269
unbelievable number of them and it's not

326
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,980
that and a lot of them are great people

327
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:16,509
but you have to find the one that fits

328
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,539
you and understands your brand and

329
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:20,889
understands your value and fits in with

330
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:23,559
the way you want to run your business

331
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:25,149
because that kind of relationship you

332
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:27,250
know a lot of the guidance I need to

333
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:30,039
give to clients when I'm in that role

334
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:32,200
and in that world is not what I would do

335
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:33,819
in that situation right it's it's

336
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,040
helping them make the decision for

337
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,500
themselves not what Jordan thinks is the

338
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:40,028
best thing for free for them but what

339
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,230
they would think the best thing would be

340
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,939
for them if they had all the information

341
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,620
that I have so I'm trying to provide

342
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,570
them with information tried them with

343
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,639
pertinent information but provide it in

344
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,170
a way that that is useful for them and

345
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,610
useful for their decision making which

346
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:53,528
means we have to get along we have to

347
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:55,778
know each other we have to share similar

348
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:57,278
values to some extent so that the advice

349
00:13:55,778 --> 00:13:59,110
you're getting isn't coming out of left

350
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:01,929
field but really coming from a place

351
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,278
that holistically works with the way

352
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:05,429
that you view your business and what

353
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,480
you're trying to accomplish

354
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,889
so the next thing I really wanted to

355
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,289
bring up and all of us definitely

356
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:14,559
understand this is government and

357
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:15,730
regulatory partnerships and some of you

358
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:17,829
in the room are probably thinking what

359
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:20,350
is this lady talking about they are evil

360
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:22,839
they're bad they are forcing us to be in

361
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:25,420
a certain way and the way I look at it

362
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:27,580
is we are all the government you know we

363
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:29,319
live in a republic and we vote for

364
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,379
representatives to represent our

365
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,720
interests and we have opportunities to

366
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:36,820
be involved in either legislation and

367
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,070
the laws that are in our local

368
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,450
jurisdictions or our state level not so

369
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,528
much at the federal level but we still

370
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,350
represent you know vote for

371
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:46,299
representatives but what can we do when

372
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,909
then different agencies are tasked with

373
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:50,799
implementing those laws and the

374
00:14:48,909 --> 00:14:52,659
opportunities to influence the rules and

375
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:56,139
regulations to implement those laws

376
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:59,948
and I'm talking beyond olcc but maybe

377
00:14:56,139 --> 00:15:01,990
Oda with hemp regulation or licensing

378
00:14:59,948 --> 00:15:04,899
our scales or licensing our food

379
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:07,509
establishments or OSHA whose ensuring

380
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:09,188
that we have good worker safety and many

381
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:11,850
of these different agencies out there

382
00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:14,559
really want collaboration and really

383
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:17,139
want to be a part of a public-private

384
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:20,229
partnership because they do nothing for

385
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:21,938
any of us if there is discourse they're

386
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,670
the ones trying to make sure that human

387
00:15:21,938 --> 00:15:26,559
health and wellness is protected and the

388
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:29,409
goals and the vision for us as a

389
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:31,869
collective group are manifested here in

390
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:33,818
Oregon so for example recently we

391
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:36,639
partnered with OSHA and took advantage

392
00:15:33,818 --> 00:15:39,759
of their consultation program and

393
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,528
invited OSHA into our facilities and

394
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,649
they actually have a program that if you

395
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:47,528
invite their OSHA consultants in you are

396
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:49,568
immune from any fines for a certain

397
00:15:47,528 --> 00:15:51,399
amount of time and they tell you all the

398
00:15:49,568 --> 00:15:52,990
different things you could be doing to

399
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:55,059
better protect youth the health and

400
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:56,740
wellness of your associates and your

401
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:58,899
employees and to let you know if you're

402
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:02,139
breaking any laws which I really think

403
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:05,169
was amazing and so as all of us him and

404
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:07,089
ha about olcc and the rules that rules

405
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:08,769
changing all the time I just want to

406
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:10,060
encourage everybody to really involve

407
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:13,419
themselves with different regulatory

408
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:14,679
agencies so you know maybe you guys can

409
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:16,149
I'll give an example of how you've

410
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:19,528
really worked with government affairs or

411
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:22,059
within your own organizations so

412
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:26,289
probably a lot of you folks have done -

413
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:29,258
I was a actually the first recreational

414
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:31,059
store and several municipalities but

415
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:35,019
I'll give you an example of one and it

416
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:37,989
was our first recreational store I went

417
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:39,839
in you know locally to the local

418
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:43,240
government or the county government and

419
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,689
I was like you know hey I'm here I need

420
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:50,379
to get local licensing and stuff and

421
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:53,740
people weren't so happy and warm and

422
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:58,080
fuzzy about me being a cannabis guy and

423
00:16:53,740 --> 00:17:01,149
and trying to get like local licensing I

424
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,590
got the paperwork and left and I was

425
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:06,490
like geez you know that was pretty

426
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:08,079
pretty cold reception I got so the next

427
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:11,019
time I went in I went to a local

428
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:15,639
restaurant that makes great homemade

429
00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:18,549
pies and stuff and I brought a pie and I

430
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,110
sliced it up and I said to the reception

431
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:22,210
ladies it was the planning department

432
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:24,909
where the cannabis czars basically of

433
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:26,920
this county sliced up the pine gave some

434
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,930
to the receptionist and gave some to the

435
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,330
guy that was going to be the cannabis

436
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:34,420
our wasn't quite named yet but we knew

437
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:36,069
we identified who he was and and that he

438
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,500
was going to be the cannabis are for

439
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:41,889
their county and we sat down and we ate

440
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:44,500
pie and I I know it sounds simple and

441
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:47,410
almost contrite but it was such an

442
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:50,529
icebreaker and to break bread with folks

443
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:52,810
and to sit down and to you know be on a

444
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:54,430
personal level with them really made all

445
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:56,980
a difference in the world starting that

446
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:59,830
relationship and from then on you know I

447
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,599
was a pie guy and everybody expected

448
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:03,699
either doughnuts or a pie or something

449
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,829
every time I walked in and it worked

450
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:10,600
like a charm so I would I would tell you

451
00:18:05,829 --> 00:18:13,299
that the the the the takeaway from that

452
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:15,819
is that these are all people they're

453
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:17,710
they're all in a lot of cases great

454
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:20,139
people they're they're public servants

455
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:23,769
for God's sake so treat them with

456
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:26,410
respect treat them with dignity treat

457
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:29,440
them as you would you know a neighbor or

458
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:32,440
a friend and you'll be surprised how how

459
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:37,630
well those relationships go and I love

460
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:39,610
what you said in the sense that we have

461
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:42,010
to have these folks as partners and the

462
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:44,379
more they're in our facilities the more

463
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:45,940
transparent we are the better we're

464
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,400
going to get along with these folks so

465
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,160
just don't be adversarial with these

466
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,450
people you will it will serve you in no

467
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,690
way shape or form

468
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:57,319
make them your partners treat them again

469
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:04,720
with respect and dignity and

470
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:11,299
and it will go a long way for you great

471
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:13,069
common human kindness yeah it's I always

472
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:14,839
remember your please and thank yous we

473
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:21,649
learn it as kids and then we forget it

474
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:23,899
at about age 20 life I think that I have

475
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:26,060
you know Josephine County we've really

476
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,340
reached out to them we do the litter

477
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:30,589
cleanup along the roads and and do all

478
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:33,199
the the maintenance along cedar flat

479
00:19:30,589 --> 00:19:36,379
road and we work with them and when we

480
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,630
walk into that into their offices

481
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,810
we're always welcomed and we're not that

482
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:43,040
you know big wreck up there on the hill

483
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:45,129
and I think we've really worked with

484
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:49,430
them I think the olcc

485
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:52,100
you know I all get the olcc memo we were

486
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:55,039
hit with a pretty big fine we used to

487
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:57,980
operate under the the guise of you know

488
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:01,129
beg for forgiveness and we don't do that

489
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:03,079
anymore and you know what they were

490
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:05,390
great through the whole process was it

491
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:07,419
embarrassing sure I certainly doesn't

492
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:12,680
fit our values of operational excellence

493
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:14,779
but we were never treated rudely and I

494
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,920
think that was our relationship one of

495
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:20,029
the very first things I did when I

496
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:23,180
started running the company was hired at

497
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:26,359
we have a compliance officer who his

498
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:28,640
number one job was to be embedded in the

499
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:30,349
olcc and know everybody and be able to

500
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,540
know the regulations and if I had a

501
00:20:30,349 --> 00:20:34,069
question I wanted to ask it and know it

502
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:36,500
right there and not have to have

503
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:38,149
somebody go research it and I think

504
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,579
having that relationship with the olcc

505
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:42,590
really attributed to that so I think

506
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:44,240
exactly what you guys all said they're

507
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:47,809
not your adversary they're actually your

508
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:52,430
partner and you'll get to success a

509
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:54,849
whole lot faster with pie then you will

510
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,850
invite

511
00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:00,058
I mean think in in all of the

512
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,529
experiences I've had around that that's

513
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:03,389
definitely consistent with what I've

514
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:05,069
seen from a regulatory perspective right

515
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,288
building relationships with regulators

516
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:09,000
is is kind of critical but it's

517
00:21:07,288 --> 00:21:11,158
important to understand that that this

518
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,808
isn't just a local game right it works

519
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:14,640
its way all the way up through the state

520
00:21:12,808 --> 00:21:18,288
and even even to the federal government

521
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,549
I you know I look at cannabis

522
00:21:18,288 --> 00:21:21,599
legalization in the end of prohibition a

523
00:21:20,548 --> 00:21:24,298
little bit differently than a lot of

524
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:26,519
folks given the nature of my kind of

525
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:28,379
initial engagement that I was just some

526
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:30,119
some policy nerd from New Jersey that

527
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,650
moved to Colorado and the state was like

528
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:33,750
you go figure this out and implement

529
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:35,100
legalization and I had my little

530
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,529
brothers back home being like you better

531
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:39,599
not screw this up for the rest of us and

532
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:41,339
so my my prison my first really

533
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:44,069
emotional reaction to all of this is is

534
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:46,168
is not that it's a right actually and I

535
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:47,220
think it should be but today it's it's

536
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:49,288
not even a privilege it's a

537
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,509
responsibility it's a responsibility

538
00:21:49,288 --> 00:21:54,089
that we we have to everybody else that's

539
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:55,710
not living in a free society at least as

540
00:21:54,089 --> 00:21:57,599
it comes to cannabis prohibition and

541
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:00,000
doing things the right way and that

542
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,829
involves really changing kind of hearts

543
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,529
and minds and and stealing almost like a

544
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:06,000
military term and understanding that

545
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:07,918
what we're trying to do here is kind of

546
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,929
convince the people from outside the

547
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,788
cannabis community that that cannabis

548
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:15,419
legalization is a good thing that

549
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:17,158
prohibition was not the appropriate way

550
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:19,320
to structure and regulate society in

551
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:21,510
control society and that cannabis

552
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:23,939
businesses can follow regulations they

553
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:25,980
can follow the rules they can lobby and

554
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,538
change laws of Congress so it's you know

555
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,130
following the regulations in building

556
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:30,869
local regulations so you can get answers

557
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:32,520
from olcc and things like that are

558
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:33,869
incredibly important right now the

559
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:36,389
narrative is that cannabis regulation

560
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:38,189
works if that narrative shifts and

561
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,840
businesses stop complying with the

562
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,700
regulations if licenses start getting

563
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,038
pulled left and right and violations go

564
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,569
up its we're gonna see the tide turn

565
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:47,369
we're gonna see the the people who are

566
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:48,928
not part of the cannabis community being

567
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:51,839
like well those people couldn't be

568
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:53,220
trusted we gave them a chance and you

569
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,019
see that same thing going all the way up

570
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,339
through the federal government and when

571
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:58,589
you go I don't know how many

572
00:22:56,339 --> 00:23:00,779
into n CIA's Lobby days but to actually

573
00:22:58,589 --> 00:23:02,459
go down to Congress and actually meet

574
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,629
with people and show them the face of

575
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,519
the people running the cannabis industry

576
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:07,080
it's a lot easier to be like all those

577
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,509
cannabis people are criminals when

578
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:10,859
they're just some kind of face

579
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:12,089
faceless person you know they don't have

580
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:14,009
a name they're not human they're

581
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:15,299
dehumanized in their mind if you go

582
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:16,289
there and sit down across from them and

583
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:18,299
really meet with them

584
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:20,099
it's a lot harder for them to think bad

585
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:22,079
things about you right because they've

586
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:23,399
met you you talk about your kids you

587
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,500
talk about your family you talk about

588
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,930
how you're just like them you're a good

589
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,640
person trying to do you know the right

590
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:32,070
by the people in your life and so you

591
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,900
have to build those relationships at the

592
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:36,089
local level through PI you have to build

593
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,160
relationships with compliance officers

594
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:40,259
at the state level with the olcc to get

595
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,390
answers to your questions and you have

596
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:44,220
to actually engage the federal level to

597
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:46,590
help everybody move this forward and

598
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,990
understand that this is beyond its even

599
00:23:46,589 --> 00:23:51,000
beyond a business necessity it is a

600
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:52,920
necessity for our movement it's a

601
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,029
necessity to end prohibition it's assess

602
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:58,289
'ti for our entire industry to survive

603
00:23:56,029 --> 00:24:00,480
absolutely that was great thank you I

604
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:01,920
really appreciate that and I think all

605
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,079
of us in the room have kind of had that

606
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,870
feeling of being the beginning of

607
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:09,119
legalization here in Oregon we can't

608
00:24:06,869 --> 00:24:10,829
mess it up you know our dispensary in

609
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:12,299
Southern Oregon and little gold Hill was

610
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:14,490
the very first one to get a moratorium

611
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:17,309
lifted and I had to work really really

612
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,900
hard with the city government and every

613
00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:21,240
single one of them that voted for our

614
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,860
license then faced a recall election in

615
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,470
the community for allowing us to open

616
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:27,089
and they all held their positions so I

617
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,950
was really excited about that I was like

618
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:30,750
oh no I got to do this right because

619
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:32,220
then Medford is not going to open up and

620
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,529
Grants Pass isn't gonna open up if I

621
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,660
make a mistake here so having that

622
00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:38,819
ownership and that feeling of that you

623
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:40,320
know hey we can open this up and I think

624
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:43,589
we've done a great job here in Oregon

625
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:45,779
and I'd like to think that our great

626
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:48,329
testing model and our organizational

627
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:50,129
structure between us and the regulatory

628
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:51,629
agency are models that other states are

629
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:54,390
potentially using in benchmarking

630
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:55,590
benchmarking with olcc and all of us and

631
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:57,630
I know that you're doing a lot of

632
00:24:55,589 --> 00:25:00,659
consulting work and some of the stuff

633
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:02,610
that's happening in Colorado so now that

634
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,529
we have our organizations formed we have

635
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:06,769
great partnerships and we have great

636
00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:09,299
consultants and wonderful employees and

637
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:10,079
we are working really well with our

638
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,579
government

639
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,710
another big strategic partnership that I

640
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:17,379
really think about is branding and

641
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:19,210
promotions and how to get your brand out

642
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:20,710
there which is really important

643
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:22,720
especially I call it the Goldilocks

644
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,400
principle here in Oregon we have to

645
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,970
produce just the right amount for our

646
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:30,670
citizens or prices plummet or there's

647
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:33,819
risk of people exporting without

648
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:35,350
permission so what can we do to really

649
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:36,129
promote our brands within our

650
00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:39,309
communities

651
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:42,700
and for me that was public relations and

652
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:44,919
I looked at a few different PR firms but

653
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,960
I just personally felt that outsourcing

654
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:49,990
that I really couldn't really keep that

655
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,180
vision consistent with our company so we

656
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:54,849
actually decided to just recently hire a

657
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:56,289
brand manager in-house but can you guys

658
00:25:54,849 --> 00:25:58,299
share with us a little bit about what

659
00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:00,399
you've done for branding and marketing

660
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:01,990
and strategic partnerships and really

661
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:06,310
getting your message out there in the

662
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:09,609
community again we were very fortunate

663
00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:12,129
because we have the resources to do

664
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:13,929
in-house marketing and because we were

665
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:16,930
vertically integrated it made it very

666
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:18,580
easy for us to tell a story and at the

667
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:21,640
end of the day I think marketing boils

668
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:24,129
down to a story and you can create

669
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:27,780
whatever story you want as I was telling

670
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:30,370
the panel earlier our story is and was

671
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:31,899
that we have a grow in Leadville

672
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:35,919
Colorado which is the highest

673
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:38,440
municipality in the lower 48 so in

674
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:42,970
effect we have the highest legal grow in

675
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:48,789
the world and that if a budtender says

676
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:50,470
that to to a guest it rolls right after

677
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:51,819
that right and they're like well what do

678
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,740
you mean the highest grow in the world

679
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:55,419
and then you know there becomes this

680
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,910
conversation about this grow and

681
00:26:55,420 --> 00:27:02,320
Leadville Colorado at ten thousand two

682
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:04,960
hundred feet and that that starts to

683
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:07,148
brand and and by doing that and by doing

684
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,569
it on a literally

685
00:27:07,148 --> 00:27:13,418
guest to guest level the word gets out

686
00:27:10,569 --> 00:27:15,398
and as you guys know the best way to

687
00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:17,889
brand yourself is by someone else

688
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:20,349
branding you and by someone that has

689
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:22,689
tried your product on those guys are

690
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:25,148
great the bud tenders are great the

691
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:27,759
product is great the facility is great I

692
00:27:25,148 --> 00:27:30,038
feel you know safe warm and fuzzy when

693
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:32,950
I'm in there and I walk out with some of

694
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:37,119
the best product I've ever had so that

695
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:38,798
in my mind is is a strategic branding I

696
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:40,808
wouldn't call it strategic branding I

697
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:43,960
call it grassroots branding and I think

698
00:27:40,808 --> 00:27:46,000
for us it showed very well for our

699
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:49,829
business and again we were able to open

700
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,240
six doors and be very successful so that

701
00:27:49,829 --> 00:27:54,128
would be my take away in Brandon no I

702
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,388
think your customers are strategic

703
00:27:54,128 --> 00:27:56,528
partnerships right if you're doing it

704
00:27:55,388 --> 00:27:57,459
right and you're really able to get your

705
00:27:56,528 --> 00:27:58,898
mission through and they're very

706
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,519
passionate about what you're doing

707
00:27:58,898 --> 00:28:01,808
they're gonna go out there and and share

708
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:04,058
with other people so part of your

709
00:28:01,808 --> 00:28:06,490
strategy is being very true to the

710
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:09,128
vision and mission with every touchpoint

711
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:11,788
I think that's so important right

712
00:28:09,128 --> 00:28:14,859
because you can spend so much money on

713
00:28:11,788 --> 00:28:18,278
outside marketing and outside marketing

714
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:19,778
people as we all know there's 50,000

715
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:21,819
people that want to be your marketing

716
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:24,519
representative out there and stuff but

717
00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:27,819
at the end of the day it's you it's it's

718
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:30,308
what you have in that jar and it's what

719
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:32,678
you're able to prove a and educate your

720
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:35,619
guests to and if you're able to do that

721
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:41,409
you know responsibly and in a in a kind

722
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:42,699
manner it goes a really long way yeah I

723
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:46,028
couldn't agree more

724
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:47,850
I think though the foundation is the the

725
00:28:46,028 --> 00:28:50,528
values of your company and your mission

726
00:28:47,849 --> 00:28:52,599
today when mr. Belushi was talking about

727
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:54,490
being Stewart's of the cannabis industry

728
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:56,168
that's shadow boxes mission we are

729
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:58,450
Stewart's of the cannabis industry and

730
00:28:56,169 --> 00:28:59,919
when I first started with a company we

731
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:03,429
were trying to roll out a new product

732
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,710
and we I don't know we talked for two

733
00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:07,028
months and they couldn't agree on what

734
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,129
the packaging was gonna look like or

735
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:11,169
this and it was very obvious that we

736
00:29:09,128 --> 00:29:12,939
couldn't make those decisions because we

737
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:14,050
didn't know what we were we didn't know

738
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,570
what we stood for

739
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:18,639
and we even went out and hired a

740
00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:20,169
marketing firm and they didn't know what

741
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,870
we were and they didn't know what we

742
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:25,300
stood for and I've heard it a hundred

743
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:26,500
times in different meetings oh we don't

744
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:28,990
have enough time for that we don't have

745
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,640
time for that BS or we can't afford that

746
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:33,190
well you can't afford not to do it you

747
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,890
have to slow down you have to decide

748
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:37,029
what are you about what do you stand for

749
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:39,160
because you stand for something or you

750
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:40,750
stand for nothing and what is your

751
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,880
company going to represent what are you

752
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:45,430
gonna represent what are it so that your

753
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,470
employees - what are they why do they

754
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:50,470
work for you it's all of these pieces

755
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:52,269
connect and then you can talk about a

756
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,650
strategic partner but if you go out and

757
00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:55,389
hire marketing firm you think they're

758
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,890
gonna fix it before you've done that

759
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:59,259
homework before you've built that

760
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:01,480
foundation you're gonna spend a whole

761
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:03,339
lot of money and you're gonna spin

762
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,140
around and you're at the end of it

763
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:07,419
you're not gonna know what you stand for

764
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,160
and so I think there is a step before

765
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,960
you go strategic partner in the

766
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,880
marketing realm is and and there are

767
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,579
agencies out there who can help you do

768
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,030
this work if you don't know how to do it

769
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:20,409
but there and that's a good investment I

770
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:22,889
had the good fortune of doing it a few

771
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:25,210
times in my life so we saved that money

772
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:27,490
but we took the time and it took us

773
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,900
about three months and we did the

774
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,519
homework and we brought the team in it

775
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,960
what did we want to represent what were

776
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:33,900
our values what was our stake in the

777
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,910
ground our TrueNorth that we wouldn't

778
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:40,750
deviate from and you know it was

779
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:43,230
fascinating about it is it began to

780
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:45,490
resonate and the employee started to

781
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:48,069
regurgitate it and they started to talk

782
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:50,740
about it and they started we have this

783
00:30:48,069 --> 00:30:52,779
really pivotal moment in our history of

784
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:56,140
our company is we had to extract er

785
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:58,119
machines that we prematurely bought we

786
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,440
had a horrible break-in one of them got

787
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:01,839
stolen

788
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,900
we had one left with some various parts

789
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:06,129
and we had an opportunity selling but

790
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,290
the person we were going to sell it to

791
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:11,110
wanted it to be a cash deal and wouldn't

792
00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:13,809
fill out the IRS paperwork and at the

793
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:16,869
time we really needed the money we're

794
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:19,269
talking about $125,000 we really needed

795
00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:22,750
the money and out of the mouths of babes

796
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:24,730
our office manager said it just doesn't

797
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,829
feel right and that's not part of our

798
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:27,579
values I think if we do this to him

799
00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:29,500
we're not being good

800
00:31:27,579 --> 00:31:31,990
Stewart's and it stopped me in my tracks

801
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:35,349
because I was focused on the hundred 25

802
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:37,539
grand and how I was gonna figure out how

803
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:40,779
to deposit a hundred thousand dollars

804
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:42,069
I wasn't thinking about and out of the

805
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:45,910
mouths of babes and that's when you know

806
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:47,919
you got it and and then we engaged a PR

807
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:49,870
firm because we were able to show them

808
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,820
our brand book we were able to show them

809
00:31:49,869 --> 00:31:53,109
what we what we stand for and when that

810
00:31:51,819 --> 00:31:56,439
begins to resonate through your whole

811
00:31:53,109 --> 00:32:01,000
organization we were able to launch five

812
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:03,490
new SKUs from January till June we

813
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,950
couldn't get one done but we were able

814
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:07,690
to do five because it's very easy we

815
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:10,360
know what we stand for we know what our

816
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:12,610
brand is and we can get into a room and

817
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:14,679
we can do it pretty quickly now so I

818
00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:16,240
would say that's the foundation if you

819
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:19,420
think you don't have time you better

820
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,819
make time especially before you engage a

821
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:26,769
PR firm or a marketing firm that will

822
00:32:21,819 --> 00:32:28,629
take a whole lot of money from you this

823
00:32:26,769 --> 00:32:30,670
has been a really a new problem that

824
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:32,020
I've had to face in my career is how do

825
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:33,759
you brand yourself and in the cannabis

826
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:36,700
industry I think whether you're selling

827
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:39,579
B to C or B to B I think is Peter noted

828
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,319
it's really a grassroots effort we've

829
00:32:39,579 --> 00:32:43,240
taken a lot of different approaches as a

830
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:44,679
cannabis compliance software company

831
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,809
everybody just thinks we're an inventory

832
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,070
tracking company anybody that ever hears

833
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:49,480
us it's like oh you're just like MJ

834
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:51,460
freeway oh you're just like green bin so

835
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,200
you're just like flow hub depending on

836
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,700
which is the the talk of the town at the

837
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,980
moment and and we're not anything like

838
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:59,080
that and explaining what we do is

839
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,569
complicated and and and how what our

840
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:02,769
value is is kind of tricky because

841
00:33:00,569 --> 00:33:04,269
people don't like compliance they don't

842
00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:05,529
like to follow the rules they didn't get

843
00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:07,420
into cannabis because they like

844
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:08,559
following rules my opinion is everybody

845
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:12,550
in the cannabis industry is

846
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:14,980
anti-authoritarian and well yeah it's

847
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:17,710
it's true I am too I just want everybody

848
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:18,519
to follow this one set of rules that's

849
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,350
it

850
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:22,509
ignore all the other ones just just just

851
00:33:20,349 --> 00:33:23,919
just just the cannabis regulatory rules

852
00:33:22,509 --> 00:33:25,629
listen to those so we can legalize

853
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:29,800
marijuana what about what about the OSHA

854
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:33,070
part worker safety business regulation

855
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:35,319
stuff just not government this is from

856
00:33:33,069 --> 00:33:38,019
the government affairs guy or the drug

857
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:39,339
laws maybe listen to some other ones hey

858
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:40,389
Jordan do you mind if we open it up for

859
00:33:39,339 --> 00:33:41,740
questions because we only

860
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:43,660
eight minutes left and I want to give

861
00:33:41,740 --> 00:34:01,509
people a chance to I cut you off a

862
00:33:43,660 --> 00:34:03,640
little bit for this no you must have

863
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:05,019
been very thorough well I know that you

864
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,430
know there's a lot of different kinds of

865
00:34:05,019 --> 00:34:09,039
partnerships in business and we only

866
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:11,500
covered a few is anybody dealing with

867
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:13,840
any partnership issues or wondering if

868
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:17,619
you should do something what I do if it

869
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:19,179
doesn't work out yeah I mean you set up

870
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:21,130
a partnership you sign the things you do

871
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:24,490
your due diligence and it's still not

872
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:26,619
great how do you extract yourself err so

873
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:27,219
they're an employee you terminate no

874
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:29,168
fair

875
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:31,119
if it's an independent contractor make

876
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:32,980
sure you have a good in contract and

877
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,289
indemnification clauses to try to help

878
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:37,829
you with that and if it's a regulatory

879
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:41,710
agency then you're backpacking Europe

880
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:42,880
that's that's my approach but what if it

881
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:47,099
doesn't work out with any of your

882
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:50,019
strategic partners so inner circle folks

883
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:52,509
you know that core people that run your

884
00:34:50,019 --> 00:34:54,519
business it's a marriage at the end of

885
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:58,360
the day it's a marriage and in your case

886
00:34:54,519 --> 00:35:02,019
it is a marriage so that's what it has

887
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:04,720
to be and and be very selective about

888
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:06,369
that marriage right you know you know

889
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:08,799
date someone for two days and go hey

890
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:11,170
let's get married right you date someone

891
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,570
for six months a year year and a half

892
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:15,369
two years before you go hey you know

893
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:20,170
what I really like you let's get married

894
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:23,019
so be just unbelievably selective about

895
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:26,079
that inner circle and I would much

896
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:29,320
rather have a piece of the chain or a

897
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,509
piece of the pie missing and not be able

898
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:34,480
to function in that area that have

899
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:36,940
a real adversarial situation especially

900
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:40,210
within that inner circle so just be

901
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:43,150
advised take your time you gotta like

902
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:45,990
the people you're working with we have a

903
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:49,450
saying in our business no

904
00:35:45,989 --> 00:35:51,639
so there you go I think do a lot of

905
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:53,289
people really rush business formation

906
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:55,000
just really taking the time to have a

907
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:58,360
good operating agreement good

908
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,579
communication of goals involve a really

909
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:03,309
good law firm unless you have those

910
00:36:00,579 --> 00:36:05,170
skills yourself because the more you lay

911
00:36:03,309 --> 00:36:06,070
a great foundation then you can really

912
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:09,570
move forward from that

913
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:12,580
I think they'll always go every they'll

914
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:13,900
they'll always go bad at some point some

915
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:17,380
relationship will always go bad in

916
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:20,200
business and we have a rule and it's act

917
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:23,170
in the highest sense of right and always

918
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:24,879
be respectful and with those when you do

919
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:27,430
get to that point there's a way to be

920
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:30,789
respectful and I think that's what we do

921
00:36:27,429 --> 00:36:32,309
and you know as far as employees go we

922
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:34,840
hire adults and treat them like adults

923
00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:36,699
and and that's the way it is and then we

924
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:39,700
also expect them to act like adults but

925
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:41,469
you do get to that point where sometimes

926
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:44,230
you have to say you have to break up and

927
00:36:41,469 --> 00:36:46,539
I think having high emotional

928
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:48,579
intelligence being able to be respectful

929
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:51,190
and try to understand the other person's

930
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:52,659
point of view and if you act in the

931
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:55,750
highest sense of right you can usually

932
00:36:52,659 --> 00:36:57,129
get through those that's great I mean I

933
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,659
think it's so important to understand

934
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:00,160
that you know you never want to be a

935
00:36:58,659 --> 00:37:02,739
bridge burner especially in this

936
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:05,409
industry it's so small it's so familial

937
00:37:02,739 --> 00:37:08,169
people know each other and people these

938
00:37:05,409 --> 00:37:10,679
relationships I mean they go back a very

939
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:12,760
long time and even new ones seem to be

940
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:14,349
deeper than in other industries that

941
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,060
I've worked in that that there's a sense

942
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:17,799
of connection and community in cannabis

943
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:19,690
that doesn't necessarily exist in like

944
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,700
the oil and gas industry or something

945
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:24,820
like that and so you know you have to

946
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:26,169
understand both how to be a good person

947
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,460
when you are breaking up with somebody

948
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:30,159
you know you don't want to be the bad

949
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:32,590
breakup guy that's not good in business

950
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:34,899
it's probably good in any facet of life

951
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:36,850
as well but you also want to have an

952
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,380
exit plan right and I don't think that

953
00:37:36,849 --> 00:37:39,268
means every relationship you get in you

954
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,608
don't immediately start

955
00:37:39,268 --> 00:37:43,288
how am I gonna get out of this but if

956
00:37:41,608 --> 00:37:46,409
you do find yourself in a partnership

957
00:37:43,289 --> 00:37:47,969
and it's not working for you you know

958
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:50,999
you need a plan on how you're going to

959
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:53,519
you know and that relationship so that

960
00:37:50,998 --> 00:37:55,678
it's done in a manner that's respectful

961
00:37:53,518 --> 00:37:57,418
a manner that's mutually beneficial and

962
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:59,398
so that you're not kind of screwing

963
00:37:57,418 --> 00:38:01,469
yourself along the way right like if you

964
00:37:59,398 --> 00:38:02,909
fire your lawyer because you're

965
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:04,979
aggravated with your lawyer and you

966
00:38:02,909 --> 00:38:06,869
don't have a new lawyer in place or

967
00:38:04,978 --> 00:38:08,879
someone to take all of that paperwork

968
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:10,199
from them like you're gonna need a

969
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,209
lawyer at some point and if you don't

970
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:13,918
have a new one you could be picking that

971
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:15,538
your next attorney too quickly you could

972
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:17,458
be picking your next director of

973
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:19,528
cultivation whatever it is and so you

974
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:20,998
know understanding you know sometimes if

975
00:38:19,528 --> 00:38:22,949
our relationships not working even being

976
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:24,868
upfront about it hey like I think at the

977
00:38:22,949 --> 00:38:27,898
end of this quarter you know we should

978
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:29,338
part ways so everybody has a notice so

979
00:38:27,898 --> 00:38:31,168
you're not jumping the gun on somebody

980
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:32,938
but at the same time you need to put a

981
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:35,038
plan in place of a succession even if

982
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:36,688
it's you leaving your organization there

983
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:39,319
has to be some kind of a plan of what

984
00:38:36,688 --> 00:38:39,318
you're gonna do next

985
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:46,768
that's far any questions questions from

986
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:48,978
anybody there's one I think if you're

987
00:38:46,768 --> 00:38:48,978
loud

988
00:39:17,949 --> 00:39:23,250
for me it is really understanding our

989
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:24,639
vision as an organization and

990
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,409
understanding that we're putting

991
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:28,210
consumers first and everything that

992
00:39:26,409 --> 00:39:30,519
we're doing and then being a great

993
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:32,798
communicator people that can really go

994
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:34,509
back and forth and you know don't

995
00:39:32,798 --> 00:39:36,429
snowball and be willing to come in and

996
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:39,970
communicate I'm looking for people that

997
00:39:36,429 --> 00:39:41,858
have longevity and loyalty and able to

998
00:39:39,969 --> 00:39:43,058
communicate and kind of move forward so

999
00:39:41,858 --> 00:39:47,558
those are the things I'm really looking

1000
00:39:43,059 --> 00:39:49,839
for in my associates I this is gonna

1001
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:52,450
sound really strange but I look for

1002
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:54,849
people that have long term relationships

1003
00:39:52,449 --> 00:39:58,179
and I mean that on a private and a

1004
00:39:54,849 --> 00:40:01,960
business level so if I have if I'm

1005
00:39:58,179 --> 00:40:03,548
dealing with someone and they go yeah my

1006
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,338
best friend I've known for two years

1007
00:40:03,548 --> 00:40:07,989
that's not a good indicator for me but

1008
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:10,558
if they have you know several friends

1009
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:13,389
that they've known for 30 or 40 years

1010
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:19,180
that has some real teeth to it and has

1011
00:40:13,389 --> 00:40:20,828
some traction for me you know I look for

1012
00:40:19,179 --> 00:40:25,000
emotional intelligence when I'm hiring

1013
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:27,250
for employees we try not we do a pretty

1014
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,019
thorough interview along with a panel

1015
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,639
interview so that we are getting

1016
00:40:29,019 --> 00:40:33,608
different points of view on a candidate

1017
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:35,558
not one person's making the decision and

1018
00:40:33,608 --> 00:40:37,119
then from a business perspective I look

1019
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:38,680
for references I look for you know

1020
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,568
there's usually enough data out there

1021
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:46,239
all right look for relationships that

1022
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:47,679
I've used in the past yeah I mean I'd

1023
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:49,209
agree with all that especially the

1024
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:50,949
values and finding people who fit your

1025
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:52,809
values but but I think you also have to

1026
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:55,058
leverage your network and your

1027
00:40:52,809 --> 00:40:56,859
relationships and you know find out what

1028
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:59,559
you can about these potential

1029
00:40:56,858 --> 00:41:01,029
individuals through your friends or or

1030
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:02,769
or talk to your friends in the industry

1031
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:05,040
and figure out who they've used for

1032
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:09,039
those kinds of situations in the past

1033
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:10,779
you know I for me a recommendation from

1034
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:12,039
someone I trust is a lot more important

1035
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,960
than anything someone can say in an

1036
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:15,759
interview an interview as you pointed

1037
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,570
out can not really be indicative of

1038
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,710
reality and so you know

1039
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:20,030
you want to talk to someone they've

1040
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:23,150
worked for someone they've worked with

1041
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:24,860
in an industry this small you should be

1042
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:26,329
able to find somebody somewhere along

1043
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,340
the line that you know or someone that

1044
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:30,619
you know is seven degrees of Kevin Bacon

1045
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,940
away in one way or another and find

1046
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:34,130
somebody who can really give you the

1047
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:38,420
skinny on what's going on behind the

1048
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:40,039
scenes I think that's it for our group

1049
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:42,519
and the next panel is coming up and

1050
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:51,119
thank you guys for listening

1051
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:51,119
[Applause]
