1
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,760
is the fact that regulation uh in german

2
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,559
european market is still allowing us

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,560
so

4
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,479
we're gonna do that we

5
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,239
what we're gonna do today is we're gonna

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,000
look for an update like where we're

7
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,640
sending the moment what are we heading

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,840
for and i'm really really happy to have

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,439
like three great experts sitting here

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,640
to join the panel

11
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,718
like the first one is uh young people

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,679
he's the managing director of firebait

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:49,120
and the medical of the senate equipment

14
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:52,000
or data stories yeah superstar companies

15
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:54,238
integrated so we can say this

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,159
as is

17
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:59,919
he was the co-founder and ceo of

18
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,759
mechanics also here in berlin and

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,040
austria

20
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:07,280
he is the managing director um

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,040
sorry chief technology

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,478
director

23
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,320
of pharma in slovenia so we're combining

24
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,640
expertise from

25
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:19,359
medical consumer care and technical

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,879
standpoint which will make very great

27
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:22,879
uploading so let's go

28
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,879
where were standing home let's do

29
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,840
the market is still growing and growing

30
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,959
but there's big confusion

31
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,359
about

32
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,879
regulation in germany can you give us a

33
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,599
little overview where we're standing

34
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,599
with the market at the moment

35
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,040
i think

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,118
it's

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,240
challenging at the moment

38
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:51,118
because

39
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,759
we

40
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:56,879
find ourselves confronted with

41
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,079
three different levels of regulations

42
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,359
we have

43
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:04,798
the regional level here in germany where

44
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:06,640
we fight to understand the

45
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,159
interpretation of laws

46
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,159
by regional authorities

47
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,360
as well as implementation how strict are

48
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,598
they looking at

49
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,150
and this is really very different in

50
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,199
different areas

51
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,920
[Music]

52
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,679
on on your local authority how strictly

53
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,199
this is implemented so

54
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,560
we look into the german government and

55
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,560
say okay

56
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,280
we

57
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,878
would like to see a clear regulation for

58
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,400
cbd

59
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,318
for um

60
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,319
that allows us to bring a state product

61
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,759
into the market

62
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,759
and the response of the german

63
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,479
government has been

64
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:49,199
pointing towards the usa cases our food

65
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,878
this is not a national issue this is a

66
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,759
european union issue

67
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:53,518
which

68
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,840
doesn't make it very easy for them to

69
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,280
say this is not really our problem it's

70
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,280
on the european union level

71
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,120
however

72
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,199
there are german regulations like the

73
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,840
amount of phd

74
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:10,079
that is allowed within the product and

75
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,598
just just recently just in last days has

76
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,640
been a recall of uh hand products by one

77
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,959
of the biggest

78
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,199
retailers

79
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,158
who have actually recalled it back

80
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:24,000
because of

81
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,719
two highest thcd levels

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,158
so

83
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,400
there is an interaction we have this

84
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,659
discussion before about

85
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,400
hand production and uh

86
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:34,799
[Music]

87
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,840
so then we go to the european union on

88
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,680
this

89
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,598
level and before we see that we see it's

90
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,799
our food you have to apply it apply for

91
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:44,158
it

92
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,640
it's a long process it's a lot of things

93
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,560
aren't clear so

94
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:51,199
we're looking to the union want to have

95
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,158
federal regulations on that level

96
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,560
um

97
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,840
however it is extremely difficult to

98
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,000
lobby for

99
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,319
regulations within the european union

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
unless it comes from a specific country

101
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,000
the country has an interest to regulate

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,280
it and put puts together it's much

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,719
easier

104
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,400
i'm not seeing this at the moment that

105
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,000
this is one country that's really

106
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,799
driving the policies

107
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,919
so in this field you have to figure out

108
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,840
um can i bring out state boards and

109
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:20,719
cosmetics what's the difference between

110
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,719
cosmetic and

111
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,319
food supplement

112
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,959
is food supplement possible at all or

113
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,279
it's all uh um

114
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,120
if i cannot bring out the food how much

115
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,879
leeway do we

116
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,478
have on the

117
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,399
regional level

118
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,959
um to to

119
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,959
until i have

120
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:46,490
[Music]

121
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,800
level to actually

122
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,560
bring the product out maybe under a

123
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,600
certain different level so this is like

124
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,000
the

125
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,040
just drawn up the whole picture um this

126
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,560
is where we

127
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,720
we're playing on those three fields with

128
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,439
all that's happening is it's almost

129
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,960
different

130
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,079
it's very difficult to navigate as a

131
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,638
company

132
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:11,038
because you have to look at all of them

133
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,439
thank you very much and as we obviously

134
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:16,399
saw that like a lot of different

135
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:18,560
technical aspects so that's really like

136
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,478
big [ __ ] one of them

137
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,439
as you mentioned it's a big issue still

138
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:26,000
to talk about the 0.2

139
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:28,719
thc thresholds that you have

140
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,360
for cv products in germany it leads to

141
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,600
a lot of very rare cases

142
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,919
in your market so

143
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,759
i would first like to ask you

144
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,519
question what is your view on that from

145
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,160
technical perspective you said that

146
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:45,279
police's uncertainty securities

147
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,479
uh yeah both regulation market and what

148
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,478
are the repercussions of this

149
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,800
well the first thing you you need to

150
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:58,318
know what the concentration of dhc in

151
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:02,240
your sample product is so what what what

152
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,319
we need is a common election that would

153
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,519
prescribe the proper methods for the

154
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,120
analysis

155
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:11,519
so one one way to go is to use the the

156
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,280
existing iso standardization for the

157
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,439
developers so

158
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:18,719
if the abandoned particle is accepted

159
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:21,719
according to iso 1725 standard in this

160
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,720
laboratory

161
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,759
so basically

162
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,879
one

163
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,960
first

164
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,560
every product needs to be analyzed and

165
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,519
created

166
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,360
you need how you need to take the

167
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,038
measurement uncertainties into

168
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,439
consideration

169
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,038
and then when this product becomes

170
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:45,839
viable for the money

171
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:51,038
so basically what we need here is a

172
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:52,159
unified view of the analytical processes

173
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,199
so

174
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,759
i can tell you from my experience that

175
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,360
when you analyze samples in the monitor

176
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,120
as a customer

177
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,199
even

178
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,079
it's even much worse in the united

179
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,720
states

180
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:09,120
you get a range of results

181
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,720
so let's say we would have a sample that

182
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,879
would be clear but

183
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,240
in terms of quality service

184
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,719
for instance

185
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,199
would have the highest the highest

186
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,240
number would be 0.17 that our quality

187
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,199
control would still get through but then

188
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,680
then

189
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,879
i can send it to a couple of laps that

190
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,519
will show

191
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:32,478
point 22 of plc

192
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:36,639
so taking into consideration the 15

193
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:37,598
uncertainty which is a bad concentration

194
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,560
um

195
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:40,159
you

196
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,319
basically

197
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,759
you shouldn't put anything on the market

198
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,840
with which is above 0.70 so

199
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,720
basically what we have is the range of

200
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,478
numbers from 0.20 to the point 11.

201
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,560
so this is something that needs to be

202
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:58,800
considered when you put your products to

203
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,240
the market when you buy the products

204
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,800
this is a big

205
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,800
big mess

206
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,720
in the business but when when i said

207
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,639
accreditation so there's iso iso 1 17 25

208
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,039
replication for the body

209
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,038
so let's

210
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,199
so when you go to the market people will

211
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,680
say okay we have gmp certified or even

212
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,960
worse the americans would say we have

213
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,959
the cg b which means current it's

214
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:36,958
nothing special we see in front of the

215
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:38,000
gp but what exactly does this gmp refer

216
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,439
to

217
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,080
so let's

218
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,519
let's take it uh from the beginning

219
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,160
so

220
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,720
you can have a if you're a producer of

221
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,838
the cosmetic products you can have the

222
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,320
iso

223
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,320
22

224
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,399
617 i think it's called certification

225
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,480
and this is called gmp good

226
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,720
manufacturing practices for cosmetic

227
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,839
products okay so you can be honest and

228
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:08,200
say i have gnp for cosmetic products

229
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,200
which is basically an iso 2016.

230
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:15,469
[Music]

231
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,959
the second the second

232
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,919
one step further

233
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:31,919
is the

234
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:33,199
basically the good manufacturing proper

235
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:34,079
process

236
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,160
for

237
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,160
certification work for um

238
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:43,120
so this is the next level so now we have

239
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:46,000
two genes again you can ask your your

240
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,639
provider with what type of the gene the

241
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,559
one relevance or the one for this one

242
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,399
okay and there's a nice representation

243
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,838
for the environment so this is all in

244
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,919
the business already it doesn't need to

245
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,640
be reinvented

246
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:58,159
so

247
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,199
it exists

248
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:03,039
so basically they become what everybody

249
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,959
would like to have and what everybody

250
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:08,078
would like to advertise

251
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,919
but the final gmt is the gmp

252
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:12,799
that is

253
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:18,439
connected to the active for disability

254
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:18,439
so as you know last year german foreign

255
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:25,919
published monograph on standardized

256
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:28,078
analysis so this automatically means

257
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,838
that all european

258
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:33,278
medicine agencies

259
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,200
can approve production of

260
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:37,679
api from

261
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,920
from the from the camera sector

262
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:43,519
but the rules are the symbol so it has

263
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:44,639
to have ph content between 1 and 25

264
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,278
and

265
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,199
cbp content whatever is advertised plus

266
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,838
in the standards so basically this is

267
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,480
the real gmt but for this gmp you need

268
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,000
isolated premises and the whole flow of

269
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,680
materials and people

270
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,958
standardized

271
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:04,078
according to the to the rules of

272
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:06,159
european medicine agency and all the

273
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,559
local agents so

274
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:10,159
what i want to say is this big message

275
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,399
is this is

276
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,480
most common in in canada's business

277
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,759
because everybody wants to say we have

278
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,600
gm

279
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,439
so the message here is they come

280
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,399
messages

281
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,720
watch

282
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,519
check what kind of g repeat the provider

283
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,399
is designed

284
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,399
to start

285
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,399
with

286
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,319
because i mean all this kind of

287
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,639
regulation

288
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,959
let me be frank

289
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,919
we started with this analog

290
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,518
issues of dhc thresholds and cp products

291
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,679
you know and you can talk about the

292
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,320
uncertainties i mean doesn't it rather

293
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,838
kind of useless considering that we are

294
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,639
working with different thresholds in

295
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,959
different countries to

296
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,560
change those thresholds for example as

297
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,518
they're going on czech republic of

298
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:03,838
poland

299
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,839
uh i mean doesn't that also have like

300
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,760
some pretty serious repercussions for

301
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,560
producers for example in germany you get

302
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,399
their commodities from there like what

303
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,638
do you think about sebastian like what

304
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,078
effects do you see from that

305
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,440
especially when it comes to like for

306
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:21,679
example farming and so on

307
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,680
yes

308
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,559
which right um is some ios from our

309
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,879
farmers

310
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,638
and there is a ratio you can only use

311
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,799
european varieties

312
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,639
catalog and the seeds that you will be

313
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:39,319
farmers can use separation of about 1 to

314
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,320
35 thc lcd

315
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,278
you get a cv concentration of maximum 3

316
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:49,278
4 5

317
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,839
once you have the threshold of 0.2

318
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,320
lifted up to one percent you can get

319
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,240
five times more cpu environments

320
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,360
wireless is paid by the concentration of

321
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,839
cbd

322
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,200
for us as an extraction company fixed

323
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,639
cost

324
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,959
does not have two percent of five

325
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,039
percent of ten percent cd and starting

326
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:12,039
from somewhere you have problem so of

327
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:14,000
course our aim

328
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:15,199
is possible

329
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,039
as long as a

330
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,200
thc concentration limits environments

331
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,519
different countries certain countries

332
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,759
will not be able to offer the future of

333
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,560
farmers a possibility to sell and

334
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:28,720
violence for example like here located

335
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,879
in berlin poland is about one hour drive

336
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,399
for us the czech republic is known to

337
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:36,320
her powers lifelines mute is five hours

338
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,399
if empowered in the czech republic the

339
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,000
limit will be lifted to one percent

340
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,000
we will buy from farmers in the czech

341
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,240
republic and empowerment because the

342
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,159
consumer doesn't like for him from his

343
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,120
mind as it comes up he's looking to the

344
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,559
price

345
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,320
so this is really an important issue

346
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,078
that we have in the european union the

347
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,920
same limits and as you have heard

348
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,759
earlier from politicians it doesn't

349
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:58,159
matter if you're by two or zero point

350
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,720
six or one percent and the level is one

351
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:03,120
percent because it is for us as european

352
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,278
produces like the possibility to also

353
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,320
compete with the americans and canadians

354
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,480
who are not

355
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,760
founded to the catalogue of european

356
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,959
varieties if they have the right you

357
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:17,360
should stand 50 or 20 of cd so pricing

358
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:19,119
should be always much lower

359
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,800
that sounds like you're calling for

360
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,720
harmonization of like european

361
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,679
regulatory framework

362
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,320
at the same time i remember union once

363
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,559
telling me that you consider those calls

364
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,600
for a european union

365
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:36,000
yeah organizations new regulations to be

366
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,959
kind of like print tax that was already

367
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,929
used

368
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:41,049
why do you think so

369
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:41,049
[Music]

370
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,799
we can wish for a lot of things

371
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,799
to get into this dialogue and i think

372
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,360
there have been some good examples here

373
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:05,359
in within a journey to actually actively

374
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,360
engage in discussion as the industry

375
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,360
organization

376
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:20,308
[Music]

377
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:27,278
but even germany where several new

378
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,560
groups that are dealing with this

379
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:30,000
problem

380
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,879
with this problem

381
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,519
um there's a new initiative is called

382
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,360
old cpa which is organizing industry

383
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,159
there is also

384
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,480
the

385
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,600
cannabis business industry association

386
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,800
from

387
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,800
europe

388
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,078
here

389
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,479
see right now that

390
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:51,278
address the humans because this is a

391
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,320
topic that they're dealing with

392
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,679
and

393
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,680
it's important that we as an industry uh

394
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:59,439
you're not against regulation we are

395
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,679
that's that's the misunderstanding i

396
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,199
think it's very important to have clear

397
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:08,000
framework to know

398
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:10,559
um exactly how uh uh however

399
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,159
there's some good suggestions

400
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:16,559
for example that that's a

401
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,078
part to to harmonize

402
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,599
testing or

403
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:23,278
methods within your company to

404
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,600
also

405
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:28,159
show those certificates openly

406
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,240
that i can see for every batch that

407
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,919
has been tested that

408
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,079
the consumer and the authorities can

409
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,919
check this at any time

410
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:37,838
those are things you can do and i think

411
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:40,559
um uh

412
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,399
that's still not going to change

413
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:43,599
because this is a very tricky but it's

414
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,720
going to help

415
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,839
uh

416
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,839
local last minute

417
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,959
which i find

418
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,360
partnership to support uh companies uh

419
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,000
um

420
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,039
in berlin to settle down to them and

421
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,039
they found everything

422
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:11,359
and trying to make this dialogue between

423
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,678
the local offered or trying to implement

424
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,119
it to the local authorities

425
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,880
and um

426
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,038
and

427
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,039
the companies to actually discuss those

428
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,640
issues and try to find solutions how do

429
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:25,359
we safely

430
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,480
how can we implement consumer

431
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,000
protection

432
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,558
in a way that everybody's satisfied

433
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,720
because i think this is the main point

434
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,558
regulation we always thought was because

435
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,798
protection i think with the whole

436
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:37,599
discussion we had so far about

437
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:38,798
uh

438
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,719
uh what

439
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,480
can i use

440
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,839
we always from the perspective is it

441
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,558
cosmetics is it

442
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:48,959
is

443
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,000
but the main main focus should be the

444
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,279
question

445
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,319
is this

446
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,759
uh

447
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,319
effect of consumer protection and i

448
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,599
think the more complicated it gets for

449
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,480
the regulation

450
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:03,038
the more companies are

451
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,960
forced for loopholes and this is

452
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:07,679
counter-productive for consumer

453
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,558
protection neo-regulation here rules

454
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,160
um i think the industry is not against

455
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:12,839
it but it should be practical it should

456
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,558
be

457
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,399
uh

458
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:18,558
should be

459
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,600
looking at billions of consumers who are

460
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:21,440
doing this

461
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,918
one way or another with a safe product

462
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,160
without the same product i think this is

463
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,520
a good dialogue that we have

464
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,919
actively nation and not wait for a

465
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,599
miracle to happen that

466
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,640
something's going to happen on national

467
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,599
or

468
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,600
european

469
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:40,879
level never lived on everybody on

470
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:43,038
changing regulations so really go into

471
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,039
the

472
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,200
you said your company is certified i

473
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,480
assume it's ifs cosmetics

474
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,480
well

475
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,440
it's for cosmetics and also for the

476
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,798
production of food supplements but not

477
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,400
from him

478
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:07,918
i mean not complaining because because

479
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,080
the entity will not issue the

480
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,400
certificate as long as there is another

481
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:15,199
food category so basically we do

482
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,000
everything in under the gmp conditions

483
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,080
but we all have the certificate for them

484
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,240
which americans can have

485
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:24,319
so to speak about consumer protection it

486
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,839
means all the products of cbd that are

487
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:27,119
sold as cosmetics because they're not

488
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,918
allowed to sell food supplements here

489
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,719
you're allowed to subscribers

490
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,480
and

491
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,000
there's no regulation then you cannot be

492
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,279
certified you cannot show that our

493
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,480
products are safe you have general

494
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,558
and revelations

495
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,319
like there are certain toxic solvents

496
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,639
which are used in years which are not a

497
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,399
lot of european market no one is looking

498
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,960
after them because it's a good

499
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,480
supplement from a certain standpoint and

500
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,279
therefore there is no regulation it's a

501
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,348
salt controller

502
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,348
[Music]

503
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:08,639
so sorry this can correctly look at it

504
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:10,400
and every product here is produce our

505
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,320
brain on the market beyond all the

506
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,720
seaweeds so if there's any questions

507
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:17,119
about it look first on the page and tell

508
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:21,360
you guys information that's a very fast

509
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:21,359
uncomplicated way how we as industry

510
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:32,538
[Music]

511
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:39,440
raised just before so as we know the

512
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:41,839
european board of justice today that cbd

513
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,519
has to be in narcotics last year so

514
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:45,439
basically i don't know about the german

515
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:46,839
legislation or any other but slovenian

516
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,880
legislation

517
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:51,759
says that you can calculate plants from

518
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,640
the

519
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:57,919
european sources as long as they have

520
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,919
less than 0.2 percent in dried biomass

521
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:03,200
which means the biomass is not

522
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,640
in between 8 and 12 percent of water

523
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,960
so basically

524
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,840
us so this is what you can contribute

525
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,159
and there's no other law regarding cbd

526
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:14,240
or camp in suing

527
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,200
for instance i think it's similar across

528
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,038
europe

529
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,840
but now when cbd is clear by the

530
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:21,599
european court of justice what prevents

531
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:24,319
you to import

532
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:27,038
biomass from the united states as long

533
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:28,399
as you can keep it what what the euro

534
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:30,240
can now consider this even though the

535
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,919
world is not safe now considers to be

536
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,558
advantageous

537
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,080
so this is this is maybe good news for

538
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:38,480
example for some

539
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:40,639
um extraction companies

540
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,880
yeah but not so good things for european

541
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,559
farming

542
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,280
but basically this is a loophole that

543
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:46,720
you

544
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,519
were talking about so one of the

545
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,880
loopholes is if cbd is not correct then

546
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:55,279
you can import violence

547
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,360
well since i don't want to repeat my

548
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:59,678
study of from the last panel you know

549
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,519
because keeping everybody talking as

550
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,240
much as i love it then we still have to

551
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,240
keep the space for uh questions

552
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,000
i would really like to finish like with

553
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:12,400
some kind of somehow do you think like

554
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,359
given the obvious lack of pharmacist

555
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,200
regulatory frameworks in europe

556
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,719
that some kind of like that

557
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,759
self-regulation

558
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,558
well then germany and europe is yeah

559
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:26,079
superior to like like lobbying for

560
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:28,319
states

561
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:30,480
regulations should should the industry

562
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,319
just be more active and show more

563
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,798
initiative to

564
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:37,279
improve and already implement in first

565
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,639
place self-regulation i know for example

566
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,720
pro cbd

567
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,000
if you're both members of the

568
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,880
association

569
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,919
you're going that way so

570
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,200
where are you

571
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,200
what do you think is a plan

572
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:57,359
where um

573
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,679
it's i think from two sides first of all

574
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,959
i i'm really proud i'm really proud

575
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,798
about like everyone who's in the

576
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,880
industry like there's usually three four

577
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,720
years there's no uh rent it's also

578
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,039
mentioned actually like uh authorities

579
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,640
are working against us in some cases

580
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:11,359
currently i feel they are working with

581
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,919
us

582
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,279
but we can't quite by the way the

583
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,440
excellent products on the market because

584
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:18,960
they want to sell city products as

585
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,320
customers who come to their office and

586
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,558
say thank you improve my life or my dog

587
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,399
or whatever

588
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:28,079
and then all against

589
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,519
what we see on the internet so that's

590
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:33,839
that's something how can we improve um

591
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:35,679
i would say it's important like i'm from

592
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:37,119
the campus industry i know my product is

593
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,120
good i know it's safe on the other side

594
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,399
i also want some authorities to look at

595
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,479
all the other products which i don't

596
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,200
know that they are safe so what can we

597
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,000
do and what was it okay let's upload the

598
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,038
seaways or the spreadsheets and it's

599
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,038
closing here but it also

600
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:08,158
it's a fantastic place to really like um

601
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,600
settle the city of berlin is extremely

602
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,919
supportive like we got the brand for

603
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:13,678
research so i protect all for product

604
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,880
development but there's also like a

605
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:19,640
building cluster where they really

606
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,640
support all the companies who are up

607
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,489
[Music]

608
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,759
but again what i would say and

609
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,200
transparency like so blind people they

610
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,919
really become politicians are very open

611
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,519
on this topic like about every party

612
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,960
everybody on this battle was in our

613
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,679
location just to speak just to

614
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,079
understand and what they say brussels is

615
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:52,240
far away what can we do here and then go

616
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,240
back to young what you said really um

617
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,038
cell are like foreign

618
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,840
or dlc those extremely high standards

619
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:06,000
and

620
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,759
then these numbers on the market until

621
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,640
our normal food application which are

622
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:12,319
energy are approved uk is an example

623
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,480
which we would like to follow the

624
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:16,879
netherlands so it's already tolerated is

625
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,278
a good example which we can follow and

626
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,200
if not the americans the canadians are

627
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:22,720
collected down us and if you cannot do

628
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,558
the same then it's zero for years when

629
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,038
the market is open they will not be

630
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:28,038
european companies

631
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:40,798
what you're looking at is

632
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,960
could we as long as you don't have to

633
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:42,960
know

[Music]

635
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:54,798
much more interesting question i think

636
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:57,278
this is going to come up now that we

637
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:59,599
have company bringing our cbd

638
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:02,240
on the european markets

639
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:04,158
as a medication is

640
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,319
where is

641
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,870
where is the border between a

642
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:09,200

which

651
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,720
obviously has very strict regulation and

652
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:26,798
therefore

653
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,798
is opening up a whole different

654
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:30,158
sector

655
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:31,119
for marketing

656
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,559
for

657

um

658
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:39,038
also for pharmaceutical regulations so

659
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:41,359
what i see is as my point as a musician

660
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:43,119
is um let's go back to the very

661
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:45,599
important thing let's look at consumer's

662
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:48,239
health and to protect consumers health

663
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,678
we should look at how dangerous is the

664
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,440
the substance we're living with we're

665
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,880
talking about three and there is data

666
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,159
plenty of data

667
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,679
safely

668
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,200
meaning we have a huge spectrum of uh

669
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,640
between um

670
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,960
on one hand

671
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,799
that they followed around 800 milligrams

672
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,840
of medical context

673
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:10,079
and um what i are considered safe about

674
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:13,038
70 milligrams as a consumer good and i

675
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:14,240
think looking at the consumers again is

676
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:16,558
also

677
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,960
looking at the change

678
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,398
why and this is why cbd came out people

679
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,120
take it on one

680
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:25,439
end of the spec people are taking cbd

681
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:27,839
because it makes them feel better

682
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,759
on the very fire there's this clear

683
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,240
medical treatment

684
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:33,599
the seizures in children

685
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,240
it's very clear

686
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:40,398
and there's a huge field in between that

687
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,519
um there's huge field between that uh

688
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:43,359
i think

689
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,359
should be limited by

690
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:48,319
how safe the product is

691
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,678
and if it's feel free for consumer's

692
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:51,839
choice

693
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,000
for example if i take cbd to sleep

694
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,558
better it does not necessarily mean i

695
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,079
have a disease like insomnia i just you

696
00:27:56,558 --> 00:27:59,839
know it helps me a little bit and there

697
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:02,558
should be some new way for for consumers

698
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:04,480
to decide

699
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:06,558
this that's the main buyer for the

700
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,720
success of cbd people just email it and

701
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:10,079
they know if i take it something

702
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,759
improves

703
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:14,158
but

704
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:16,079
the question is if for a company when i

705
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,360
bring it out is you have to feel a

706
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:21,918
medical company one day or say okay your

707
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:22,879
your product with centennial 200

708
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,038
whatever

709
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,120
the threshold is from

710
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:28,879
as i say this is going to be uh that's

711
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:31,119
medication and that's another thing and

712
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,640
we have all different legal battles to

713
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:34,319
fight for and this is

714
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,159
an uncertainty where i think we should

715
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:38,319
have a clear

716
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,200
uh regulation as well saying up to this

717
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:41,038
amount

718
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,159
for me this could be quite high because

719
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:45,519
it's not a dangerous substance

720
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,840
this is something that we need to clear

721
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:47,839
as well

722
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,798
great that's a good handling work

723
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,480
with and great timing because of the

724
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:57,119
love that seems to children got 10

725
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,038
minutes left for questions so i really

726
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:01,199
like to give it up to you

727
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,519
are any questions

728
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,519
i would guess all right

729
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,879
no questions at all

730
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,879
you've learned everything today

731
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,600
find me right

732
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:25,120
a bit more business topic to be honest

733
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,919
last year you know it became really big

734
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:29,599
and seriously you can just today open up

735
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,520
the prospect of any

736
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:34,079
grocery store chain and you will find

737
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:36,329
like a special offers on cbd products

738
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,678
and all this stuff is

739

[Music]

740
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:43,519
this coin has a flip side because i mean

741
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,480
if you look at media reports and test

742
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:48,079
reports or whatever you know

743
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,679
there have been some

744
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:53,278
damage to

745
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:55,840
cvt products in general this is what i

746
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:57,038
and some certain groups of yeah of the

747
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:58,639
people

748
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:00,798
in the most general way

749
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,240
um and we've been talking about like

750
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:03,839
those differences about like like you

751
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,599
know serious companies that you know

752
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,278
euros you know

753
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:10,319
like the direction they're heading for

754
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:12,240
medical cv products and just serious you

755
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:13,918
know like high quality cd products you

756
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,759
know

757
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,159
how do you go about this is there a

758
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:20,839
certain strategy of like

759
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,399
yeah some kind of like market

760
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:24,480
clearance like these serious high

761
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:26,239
quality companies are able to

762
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,798
distinguish themselves

763
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,919
is there a certain strategy that you

764
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:33,200
have in communications marketing you can

765
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,600
mention

766
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,360
like the importance of transparency what

767
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:38,639
are your views on that

768
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:40,639
and that

769
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,720
thinks about branding well then you can

770
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,240
buy a car or you can buy rent or build

771
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,519
if you either buy from a company being

772
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,798
trusted

773
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:48,879
for that experience it means that

774
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:51,200
finding to build a small not to make

775
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,200
itself

776

[Music]

777
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:07,679
or however you want to call it you know

778
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:08,558
but cbd is still a pretty new one and

779
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,880
then

780
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:13,519
two consumers really have that kind of

781
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,320
like like experience or

782
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:19,798
competence to differ different brands

783
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,798
and see the market

784
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:23,210
[Music]

785
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,960
and you see and read the stories that it

786
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:39,038
helps since the product that you buy in

787
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,558
firsthand does not help you it was maybe

788
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:42,240
the wrong product you'll try again maybe

789
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:44,398
not directly but after six months it's

790
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,038
still the same stories you didn't try

791
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:47,038
again because their

792
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:00,319
so it's up to your brand to choose for

793
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:00,319
some

794
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,120
let's get certified and follow the rules

795
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:12,798
about that for the cosmetics and

796
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:14,479
different supplements even though that

797
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:16,879
if we're dealing with the mouth for the

798
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,159
moment let's get let's get everything

799
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,440
under the roof

800
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,559
and let's

801
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,558
get everything analyzed and accredited

802
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:27,278
so this is what we can do at this point

803
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:29,359
i guess unless for me for

804
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,759
from general market let's let's

805
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:33,839
encourage the farmers

806
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:35,200
to to try to get certifications for the

807
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:37,599
source that are not in the nature

808
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,200
environment

809
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:43,038
to make the business better i would

810
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,038
always tell that way number one meeting

811
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,158
is

812
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,720
really go for the highest quality you

813
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,519
can you can produce and i think this is

814
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,079
the way to success

815
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,038
we actually have any questions

816
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:09,599
i know

817
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:11,839
take your time

818
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:14,558
hey thanks a lot for helping us uh

819
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,720
become educated on the good market today

my name is beau whitney i have a

economic sperm

822
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,679
based out of portland oregon

823
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,960
we look at the cannabis and higher thc

824
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,720
market

825
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,159
our projections

826
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,558
in the u.s market for the end of 2020

827
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:35,278
was that there were 201 million pounds

828
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:36,798
of excess biomass in the market

829
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:38,558
so

830
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:40,398
would you recommend

831
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:43,440
converting that into some form of

832
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:45,359
isolates cbi slits and shipping it into

833
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,480
the european union

834
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:50,839
flooding the market lowering the prices

835
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,759
or would you recommend keeping that in

836
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:55,278
biomass and trying to enter that market

837
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:57,200
that way

838
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:59,679
that's a question made for attackers all

839
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,679
right as far as i know you will feel the

840
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,320
us is already doing that

841
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,798
because if you're buying this i mean the

842
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:08,159
biomass with 10 plus percent of cbd

843
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:09,838
probably something

844
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,280
about the numbers that you're talking

845
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:13,039
about this

846
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,119
can be with

847
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:18,480
relatively high conversion efficiency

848
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,730
converted to the pure product which one

849
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,820
in one of the

850

[Music]

851
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:34,079
you managed to to produce iso very

852
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:37,599
cheaply so i think that the cheap iso

853
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:40,480
that is in europe is is by far not quite

854
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:42,399
from the european source

855
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,280
well we're actually asking you we should

856
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:48,000
keep the hampered flood market

857
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,760
probably your business or

thank you

it's a different product right like who

860
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,800
are your targets and then we come back

861
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,639
to know the food which should be the

862
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,680
first product which will pass our food

863
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,160
application

864
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:01,759
but for you i would say it's an isolate

865
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:03,118
so like from that point you can already

866
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,880
confirm it again

867
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,800
when maybe two or three years so how

868
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,880
long could you stop it

869
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,760
um but it's different and what we see

870
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,920
here consumers at least in germany they

871
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,040
are really looking for full spectrum

872
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,039
they're looking for the world

873
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:34,639
actually helping help uh pharmaceuticals

874
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,920
to cross your hand as a distance model

875
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:37,920
i like that because it's very close

876
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:42,719
mechanics which which is producing for

877
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:46,399
them on an extremely high quality yeah i

878
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:48,480
would like to have this this this

879
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,358
production in germany of course

880
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,599
yeah

881
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:54,159
but it's international market you know

882
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,119
if we do not adapt to that um

883
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:56,639
then

884
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,680
this is gonna that's gonna be the way

885
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:00,159
it's gonna be

886
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:02,799
and i think this is something that

887
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:05,279
we have to talk about over and over and

888
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,000
over again it's like especially

889
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,200
dynamic is where do you want to create

890
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,280
the jobs

891
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:12,960
you know do you make it so difficult for

892
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,640
the industry which is growing no matter

893
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,599
what you do

894
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,639
do you want to create jobs here or

895
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,480
in

896
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:22,639
the us or anywhere else in the world

897
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,320
this is always the question that

898
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:27,559
you should look at this is what we have

899
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:30,650
discussed with competitions

900
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:30,650
[Music]

901
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:42,920
