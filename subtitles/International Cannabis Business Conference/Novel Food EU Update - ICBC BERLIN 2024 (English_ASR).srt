4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,518

12
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,159
last people to leave the room as they

13
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:44,280
carry on their conversations about

14
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:48,000
cultivation in C in Germany which I'm

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,960
sure from sitting on that so early days

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,600
even though uh the law has just changed

17
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,480
I think probably licensing is only 24

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,399
months away from really actually seeing

19
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,000
someone grow something in Germany but

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,000
Peter's in the audience maybe he can

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,840
advise you on that uh when it comes to

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,280
Germany but yeah look thanks for joining

talk about novel Foods um it's still

25
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:11,640
very much novel when it comes to CBD in

26
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:16,438
the UK uh and in Europe and Canada but

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:20,118
I'm I'm pleased to introduce uh CA schur

28

of experience in farma and biotech and

30
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,320
been in the Cannabis industry since 2016

31
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,280
if I'm not mistaken and founded the

32
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,919
European medical cannabis ass

33
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,719
Association in Brussels in 2019 which

34
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:39,879
I'm sure she'll she'll discuss and to my

35
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:42,719
far left there um uh constant Mah who's

36
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:45,239
joined us all the way from Canada um and

37
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,078
has trained as a food scientist and has

38
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,519
been in the industry for about 15 years

39
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:52,679
so we're very very much um pleased to

40
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:55,359
have him on the panel and then myself um

41
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,399
as I was introduced I'm a a partner of a

42
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,000
law firm but a director of our

43
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:01,519
regulatory Solutions I've been a lawyer

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,438
for about 17 now plus years I've been in

45
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:06,078
the Cannabis industry for about four and

46
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,000
have advised clients in both the

47
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,758
medicinal and the CBD and wellness space

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,159
not recreational yet because UK is not

49
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,318
like Germany so can't discuss those ones

50
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:17,919
otherwise I'll get in trouble with the

51
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:20,518
authorities so CA yes what's on our

52
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,639
plate in Europe when it comes to canono

53
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,439
yeah or

54
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:27,039
anything well I think the situation is

55
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:28,598
um very very mixed and I know the

56
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,840
audience is a little bit maybe more

57
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:35,119
recreational but when I received all the

58
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,319
congratulations uh like weeks ago ago

59
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,360
about the development I was a little bit

60
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:40,399
astonished because I thought okay what

61
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,720
for

62
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,158
exactly uh sitting here also as an

63
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:48,919
industry uh representative for the

64
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:50,840
industry is pretty nothing in so um I

65
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,759
thought like wow okay there's some

66
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,560
associations they are nonprofit no

67
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:58,799
profit no loss no taxes um okay this is

68
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,400
a way to go but uh we will see how it

69
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,120
will develop and also you know the

70
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,120
budgets of such kind of an association

71
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,120
okay you can make your Easy Math 500

72
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,840
people let me say 500 euro membership

73
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,920
fee we are at

74
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,519
250,000 so anybody who even run a

75
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:19,878
charity organization as also I do

76
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,439
250,000 is not much money if you have

77
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:25,079
also to grow and to have uh people

78
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:28,158
engaged for the growing Etc so we will

79
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,959
see the development how this will go so

80
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,199
of course the other option was okay is

81
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,560
maybe something in the novel food area

82
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:37,199
or is it the food area I think we see

83
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,519
through Europe that Edibles are

84
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,839
tolerated um this does not mean that

85
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,280
they are legalized but they are

86
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,840
tolerated in several countries and uh of

87
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,598
course you don't know how things are

88
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,120
going on so you know this we know that

89
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,399
CBD is of course under the focus already

90
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:59,840
of the FSA we know that there were about

91
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:02,879
150 applications 19 remained um and I'm

92
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,239
really not an authority batter but but

93
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:08,000
when you see the movement of epsa and

94
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:10,200
the time they need to evaluate something

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,519
it is pretty painful we have even

96
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,798
probiotics still in evaluation which we

97
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:17,120
already know since denona and Nest that

98
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,280
this is something which is favorable for

99
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,199
your well-being and your microbiome and

100
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:27,079
still we do not have an assessment there

101
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:30,919
so this is why my hope to have for CBD a

102
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:33,359
quick reach um is not very

103
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:35,519
optimistic um but I think another

104
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,720
situation which is of course developing

105
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,680
is um the ban of being a

106
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,639
narcotic and I think this is a very

107
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,840
interesting approach because it was a

108
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,400
political not a pharmacological decision

109
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:52,119
we know it all but if you have food and

110
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:54,599
you have until now the bar the barrier

111
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,199
that you cannot mix it with a

112
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,320
narcotic which was okay we everybody

113
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,400
understood but it is now not a narcotic

114
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,120
anymore I think I will be very

115
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:07,959
interested in the legal argumentation of

116
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,519
the authorities how to deal with that

117
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:14,038
because the foot um uh Administration

118
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,839
Authority is presently refused cannabis

119
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:20,199
of course due to being a narcotic uh

120
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:22,799
their web page did not change yet and of

121
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,280
course the European side on cannabis is

122
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,520
very critical um we have still even

123
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:30,959
countries who did not approve medicinal

124
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,758
cannabis yet especially East countri so

125
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:36,279
this is where we are in discussion with

126
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:39,680
the governments um in Romania Etc to to

127
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:42,439
lift that ban um to train them on the

128
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,519
situation and also to give them

129
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:47,680
information from other authorities like

130
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:50,079
B Farm the survey was maybe statistical

131
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,639
uh not really excellent but I think it

132
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:55,159
brought a lot of information which maybe

133
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,720
one Authority can adopt from another

134
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,000
Authority the same was also for the

135
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,800
Spanish hearing which is now on going

136
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,560
where we commented as well so there is

137
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,598
things which are moving but it is

138
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,038
something what you have to consider to

139
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:13,199
be on a long run it is nothing which we

140
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:14,759
can solve I think in one or two years

141
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,639
and I think that's quite interesting

142
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,479
from a European perspective in the sense

143
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,639
of I mean for the audience and we're

144
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:24,240
both C and I European obviously I'm from

145
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,960
the UK so the continent Europe not part

146
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,918
of the EU uh I'm just lucky I've got two

147
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:32,079
passports but anyway the um for those

148
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:35,038
that are not part of Europe novel Foods

149
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,800
was has been around since 1997 so

150
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,680
basically if it's not been in your

151
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,918
dietary System since I think 15th of May

152
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,639
1997 if I'm correct it's seen as novel

153
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:47,079
so if we got water's not novel right

154
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:51,759
this has been in our dietary system

155
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:54,560
forever um in May I or February 2019 if

156
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,080
I'm not mistaken uh Europe or Brussels

157
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,680
decided that CBD was novel in an

158
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:03,000
extracted form not hemp seed oil

159
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,360
compressed but on CBD itself was novel

160
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,279
and that's why novel Foods is is

161
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,120
relevant for Europe and the UK cuz even

162
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:13,318
though the UK left uh with brexit we

163
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,079
adopted the same uh philosophy and so

164
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,720
basically anything with CBD had to go

165
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:19,399
through what your application process as

166
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,680
you said so in the UK we we basically

167
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:25,038
carbon copied um that approach however

168
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,959
there was a hybrid model the UK thought

169
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,598
that they'd be clever because of brexit

170
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,878
so whilst we were going through our

171
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:33,759
transitional period which was in back in

172
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:36,000
2020 what we said was and I think if I'm

173
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,120
not mistaken around about the 13th of

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,038
February 2020 the food standards agency

175
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,240
in the UK said look we adopt the

176
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:45,598
approach by Europe to say that CBD is

177
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,079
novel and you have to submit a novel

178
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,639
Foods application however if you're on

179
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,079
the market so basically if you've been

180
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,720
selling that you something that you

181
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:55,439
shouldn't have been selling at that time

182
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,879
you can continue selling but you've got

183
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:01,519
to submit an application once we open

184
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:03,400
our portal which was 1st of January

185
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,198
2021 and you've got to submit an

186
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,959
application and you've got to submit the

187
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,520
application before the 31st of March

188
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:12,318
2021 originally though they said they

189
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:14,478
would validate all applications by the

190
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,400
31st of March they then changed the

191
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,038
goalpost because there's someone here in

192
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,158
the audience a client of mine that was

193
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:21,759
involved in a couple of these

194
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:23,598
applications they had over 800

195
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,360
applications and obviously the food

196
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:27,240
standings agency had never dealt with a

197
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,960
novel Foods application because it was

198
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,519
all through epsa previously so they

199
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,918
thought oh Dar we're not going to be

200
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,240
able to validate all of these

201
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:37,120
applications so they changed the

202
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,959
goalpost it's said submission point so

203
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,679
if you'd submitted your applications by

204
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:46,599
the 31st March 2021 you could continue

205
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:47,879
selling then what happened was they said

206
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,720
we're going to have to validate

207
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:51,039
everybody and we have to be very careful

208
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,879
with the language and I think this is

209
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:55,159
where a lot of our friends from the

210
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,159
States and Canada and those that weren't

211
00:08:55,159 --> 00:09:00,719
part of the European discussions at the

212
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:02,480
time confuse words with validation and

213
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,560
for authorization because they're

214
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,000
completely different so validation and I

215
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:10,039
don't want to bore you guys with as I'm

216
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,919
a lawyer because no one's paying me for

217
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:13,519
this discussion so there you go I

218
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,599
usually charge for this but no I'm

219
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,759
joking but no what I don't want to bore

220
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,879
you on on on on the legal side of it but

221
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,319
basically validation is a tick boox

222
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:24,159
exercise so basically have you submitted

223
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,120
an application does it contain all the

224
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:29,078
relevant Parts have you submitted all

225
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,560
the information including testing and so

226
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:33,719
on so forth and how when when that data

227
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:36,838
is going to be readily available if so

228
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,519
that's a valid valid application so it's

229
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:42,120
validated right that's as basic as I can

230
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,959
get to then it goes through the

231
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:49,039
regulator checking it and seeing if it's

232
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:50,599
safe and all the various toxicology data

233
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,719
reviewing it and then you get

234
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,000
authorization and that's in Europe

235
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,959
that's the only time that you can sell

236
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,278
once you got authorization so now that's

237
00:09:55,958 --> 00:10:00,078
clear in the mind in the UK they said no

238
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:02,720
once you're validated you can carry on

239
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:04,679
selling and then once we authorize you

240
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,639
great you can continue if you're not

241
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:10,199
authorized then you're off the shelves

242
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:12,679
that created one a hybrid model but also

243
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,560
a monopoly for those that were already

244
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:17,278
selling illicitly and they shouldn't

245
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,119
have been which meant that investment or

246
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,000
other opportunities from the states or

247
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,560
or Canada couldn't bring in a product

248
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,759
where maybe they had the safety data

249
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,239
maybe they already had a product that

250
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,240
was selling that had no THC they could

251
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,278
know they could submit an application

252
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,399
but because they hadn't been sell

253
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,679
selling pre 13th February 2020 in the UK

254
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,679
they would have to wait until they were

255
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,278
fully authorized a bit like in Europe so

256
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,879
it created this Monopoly which I had

257
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:41,320
massive arguments with the food SS

258
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:43,360
agency because I said that's not your

259
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,320
role as a regulator your role as a

260
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,480
regulator is to ensure that consumers

261
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,079
are consuming something that is safe you

262
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,800
shouldn't be creating this infighting

263
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:56,359
between the industry so where are we now

264
00:10:53,799 --> 00:11:00,439
since all of that in the UK we've now

265
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:02,879
got a public list of those that are

266
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,720
I would say a few that have been given

267
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,278
that

268
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,680
validation the food standards agency is

269
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:11,320
still saying on their on public list

270
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:14,838
awaiting evidence I checked this morning

271
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,959
just as so we I gave you a proper proper

272
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:18,480
uh idea of of how many products on that

273
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:22,518
list

274
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,720
12,15 products on that list um of which

275
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,959
I don't know how many companies because

276
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,480
obviously as you can imagine some

277
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:30,399
companies have variety of SKS and

278
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,000
product lines and so on and so forth

279
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,879
in one

280
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,799
way it's a good thing I think for and

281
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,439
I'm not saying this cuz I'm a UK lawyer

282
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,919
I I'm I was completely against the

283
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,360
process so I just want to make that

284
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,919
clear but in one way it's been

285
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,560
beneficial because at least those

286
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:49,399
businesses can continue selling and

287
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:50,919
earning some money because they' had

288
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,480
invested so much money into their

289
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:55,000
product and the ones that probably still

290
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,920
there are probably the ones that are

291
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,679
going to continue still being there for

292
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:02,000
longevity subject to the regular giving

293
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,838
them that final certification that they

294
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,879
authorized to continue selling subject

295
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,839
to those products being safe um so

296
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:12,159
that's the that's the the screenshot of

297
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,959
where we are in the UK and I'd like now

298
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:17,319
to introduce constant again because

299
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:19,799
obviously you know he's he's a scientist

300
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,800
from the food industry and he can give

301
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:25,039
us some insight of where Canada is now

302
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:27,879
and maybe the journey that Canada's

303
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,919
taken because fundamentally us here in

304
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:32,120
Europe and the UK a are always looking

305
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,559
at Canada and the US saying your leap

306
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,879
years ahead but are you when it comes to

307
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:41,278
food uh just after hearing how you

308
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:45,919
described um the UK and the approach

309
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:48,600
that um the UK is taking on novel Foods

310
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:51,439
um I do draw some similarities but there

311
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,920
are there are Stark contrasts between

312
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:59,199
what the Canadians are doing versus um

313
00:12:53,919 --> 00:13:01,360
the UK so um you know Health Canada uh C

314
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:03,078
FIA they always get a bad rap in Canada

315
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,159
because they always seen as you know

316
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:09,078
overregulation and in some situations

317
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:11,439
that is correct um but I I think that

318
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:16,239
Health Canada and their approach for

319
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:19,680
Novo Foods or just Edibles in general um

320
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:23,000
sounds to be probably a very good middle

321
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:25,159
ground to ensuring really the ultimate

322
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,440
goal is the consumer safety uh making

323
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:29,519
sure that there's the food products that

324
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,160
is uh out in the marketplace is safe for

325
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,720
consumption there's no contaminants

326
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:36,600
there's no micro um and that your

327
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,839
consistent quality is is met uh for

328
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,800
every different batch that you produce

329
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:46,199
um so the approach that Health Canada um

330
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:50,039
takes for uh approving uh novel Foods is

331
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:52,159
that um for producers um let let's take

332
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:55,240
it from like a producer who's never done

333
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:57,480
Edibles before but they but they want to

334
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,759
uh so what they would need to do is they

335
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,480
need to establish their their food

336
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:05,600
safety program um prerequisites such as

337
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,800
your preventative control program to

338
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,000
ensuring that every step of your

339
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:12,000
manufacturing process controls and

340
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,480
mitigates the risks to an acceptable

341
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,399
level uh so that would be your chemical

342
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:23,399
contaminants heavy metals um apoxin you

343
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:26,240
name it um to to micro levels and health

344
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,440
Canada doesn't dictate which uh

345
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,440
pharmacopia you can use so there is

346
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:34,839
actually quite a bit wiggle room

347
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:38,800
between um between different testing

348
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:40,519
standards uh that might fit better for

349
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:44,758
your product category if that makes

350
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:48,198
sense so um for instance the EP

351
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:50,320
pharmacopia versus that of USP uh EP is

352
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:54,198
quite a bit more stringent in terms of

353
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,800
uh micro requirements uh so you'll see

354
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:59,519
uh a lot of Canadian producers actually

355
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:05,159
choose the the less sorry uh choose the

356
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:07,159
less uh stringent of the the pharmacopia

357
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:09,838
um when you're registering new products

358
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:13,519
as well uh it's actually on the burden

359
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:17,040
of The Producers to ensuring that their

360
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:20,240
products is safe um so through your

361
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:23,000
pcps uh once you've done that then you

362
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,519
do your final testing to make sure that

363
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,399
it's homogeneous so your cannabinoids uh

364
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:32,480
all that stuff is consistent B the batch

365
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,078
um once you've have that you just keep

366
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,199
it inh house you don't really need to

367
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:39,919
present it uh then you submit a new

368
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:42,679
cannabis sorry notice of new cannabis um

369
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:43,799
product to health Canada now this is

370
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:45,799
where we do things a little bit

371
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:47,879
differently in that Health Canada

372
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:50,318
doesn't technically have to put a rubber

373
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:52,120
stamp on your new product to say that

374
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:53,519
this is approved now you can sell they

375
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,639
give you a 60-day

376
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,679
window of the time that you submit um

377
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,839
for an

378
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:02,318
nncp uh and then after that 60 days

379
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,199
automatically you can you can start

380
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:08,078
selling so it's kind of good in a sense

381
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:11,318
that it leaves the responsibility and

382
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:12,799
the ownership of the safety the

383
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:15,078
commercial

384
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:18,559
commercialization and as as well as the

385
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:21,159
quality of the product up to the lp and

386
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:23,119
that uh sorry licensed producer and if

387
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:25,519
that licensed producer produces

388
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,919
fantastic product it's consistent it's

389
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,879
also safe uh we can pretty much

390
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:32,919
guarantee that it's it's going to have

391
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:36,240
no issues down the road um but we're

392
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:39,120
also seeing issues now where you know

393
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,759
people do these ncps they wait to 60

394
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,278
days they start selling but then Health

395
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,800
Canada comes in because they get a a uh

396
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:48,879
a market complaint saying that this

397
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:50,799
product may not be compliant to certain

398
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,720
regulations

399
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:56,198
um the

400
00:16:52,720 --> 00:17:00,240
most the most recent issue that came uh

401
00:16:56,198 --> 00:17:02,519
within Canada uh is the edible extracts

402
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,439
um I don't know if which one of you guys

403
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:06,279
here are Canadian or not um but

404
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,439
basically what happened was in Canada

405
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:14,199
you're only allowed to have 10

406
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:17,959
mgram um of uh THC within your finished

407
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:20,360
product retail product um whereas these

408
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:22,919
companies kind of found a loophole and

409
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:26,078
classified these as extracts as opposed

410
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:28,679
to Edibles uh and the xtrax requirement

411
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:31,119
is you're allowed to have way more THC

412
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:34,519
with in your finished product um so

413
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:38,000
unfortunately Health Canada

414
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:39,759
um stood fast on their determination

415
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,279
that these particular products uh which

416
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:45,400
are like lenes things that typically in

417
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:48,200
in the past when it's not infused with

418
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,919
cannabis uh is more seen as kind of like

419
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:55,319
over-the-counter

420
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:58,000
um like Health Products um like cold

421
00:17:55,319 --> 00:18:00,000
remedies that kind of stuff um there's

422
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,119
other products in the Marketplace as

423
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,519
well um that was caught with like the

424
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:08,719
mixture of melatonin with cannabinoids

425
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:10,679
you know the justification for smlp

426
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,919
saying that melatonin is a uh

427
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:15,960
stabilizing agent but really it's it's

428
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:17,440
an active ingredient and in the in the

429
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,240
eyes of Health Canada when you have an

430
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,440
active ingredient such as melatonin um

431
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,000
you must have um

432
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,159
uh a d number constant that's quite

433
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,480
interesting because obviously I don't

434
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:31,200
know if the audience has picked up on

435
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,400
this but you've been talking about

436
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,000
products that contain THD as food

437
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,000
Edibles right in the UK and Europe we've

438
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,400
only submitted applications that contain

439
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,319
CBD because recreational is not yet

440
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,519
legal obviously it is now in Germany I

441
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:50,279
don't think and I could be wrong here

442
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:51,960
maybe C just a side question here how's

443
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:54,158
the European food standards agency going

444
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,319
to look at an edible that contains THC

445
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:57,400
because that will still have to go

446
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:59,558
through a novel Foods application right

447
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,679
yeah I think for the for the fset would

448
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:04,079
be an easy one because of course the

449
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:07,320
German legislation does not apply for

450
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:09,319
the European regulation so for them it

451
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:12,399
will be still of course a narcotic and

452
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:14,798
will be uh seen as that and I think here

453
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,919
the the door will be closed very quickly

454
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:19,839
but in in similar

455
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:22,960
terms Germany if it's a food product

456
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:24,759
follows novel Foods so if it's an edible

457
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,400
that's THC it would still have to have

458
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:29,440
novel Foods authorization if it was

459
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,159
going to be sold as a food supp of some

460
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,919
sort yes and I think this is where you

461
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:37,400
know we we uh we have the difficulties

462
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:40,360
this that we do not have pharmacological

463
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,320
arguments what was put now in place but

464
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:44,079
political and of course FSA is not

465
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,879
listen to listening to political

466
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:49,519
arguments on that way so we have here

467
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,000
now of course a disruptive situation

468
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:54,359
with Germany and the European Community

469
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,519
this is why the legalization let me say

470
00:19:54,359 --> 00:20:00,558
is concentrated on clubs and not like an

471
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:03,519
uh commercial trade business um because

472
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:05,639
then we are still in the shenen and um

473
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,839
which is at the end uh replicating the

474
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,640
single convention word right and so and

475
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:12,199
the reason I raised that as a as a point

476
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,080
of discussion just for food for thought

477
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,480
using novel Foods Food For Thought for

478
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,359
the audience really is because you have

479
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,240
to think about this CU obviously I don't

480
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:22,439
know who's in the audience but I'm sure

481
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,079
there's entrepreneurs and and and people

482
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,038
that are looking to invest in businesses

483
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:29,918
or or maybe continue with their business

484
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:31,279
just because Germany's gone Recreation

485
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,038
doesn't mean that we're full-blown

486
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:36,319
recreational because again like all of

487
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:39,319
cannabis you've got variety of products

488
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:41,319
that you can create and what and I try

489
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:43,319
to read a lot of what's happened in

490
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:44,798
Canada the good and the bad stuff cuz

491
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:46,879
Europe doesn't really like Canada when

492
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:49,359
it comes to cannabis they've done not

493
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,960
done some great things uh obviously

494
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:56,319
present company excluded but when it

495
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,600
comes to where the recreational market

496
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,720
and and this may be something for you

497
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:02,158
just to just a tou

498
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,960
on we all see the news that everybody's

499
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,559
trying to ban smoking generally and

500
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,880
that's tobacco and nicotine and you know

501
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:10,678
what that looks like I've I've read and

502
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,600
I could be wrong so and you're from

503
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,278
Canada maybe you can explain that when

504
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:16,439
it comes to recreational Cannabis it's

505
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:17,558
the same thing a lot people want to get

506
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,759
high but they don't want to actually

507
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:22,038
smoke something to get high they want to

508
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:24,278
eat something right and or they want to

509
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:26,879
experience another way of getting high

510
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:29,159
so is that a general Trend in Canada as

511
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,840
well yeah there's a lot of restrictions

512
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:35,278
in Canada and it it varies provincial to

513
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:36,759
provincials um what the requirements are

514
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:39,200
and what you're what you are and you

515
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:42,119
aren't allowed but the general rule is

516
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,600
you're not allowed smoking uh anything

517
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:47,879
uh inside a building um a public

518
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:51,038
building um and within X number of feet

519
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:53,320
or meters from from an entrance um so

520
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:56,400
with that and there's also that stigma

521
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:59,278
to cannabis that you know even though

522
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,960
Canada has been full legal for for 5 6

523
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:03,599
years now um like full recreational uh

524
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,000
there's still that stigma that the

525
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:10,319
Canadians are still trying to overcome

526
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
um and Edibles and even Vape products um

527
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:14,759
it's a good alternative where you don't

528
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,278
need to have that cannabis smell uh the

529
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:20,879
pungent uh cannabis spell especially for

530
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:24,278
professionals um who you know like to

531
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,360
partake but they obviously don't want to

532
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:29,159
have any sort of negative um you know

533
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:31,158
thought process from from people EX if

534
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:34,039
they walk by them and they sell them

535
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:36,720
right um so yeah like to your point I I

536
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:39,200
think I think there is a push towards

537
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:43,319
more Edibles now you're seeing a ton

538
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:45,558
more Edibles launching every month um

539
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:47,240
there's uh so I I think there's a

540
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:50,038
there's a justification for that and

541
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,720
it's because people um more

542
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:55,759
professionals uh wouldn't want to you

543
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,839
know smell like and I I think it's a a

544
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:58,960
younger generation as well don't

545
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,439
associate

546
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,120
with smoking I mean I'm old enough to

547
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,240
remember watching movies where people

548
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,278
used to smoke on screen right or even

549
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:10,079
smoke on planes and that whole culture

550
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:12,480
is gone and I think that's also changed

551
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,519
for you know producers they are also

552
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,640
producing something that they know that

553
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:20,918
culturally it fits with their younger

554
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:23,038
Generations right so I mean it obviously

555
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:25,520
feels that Canada and something that

556
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:27,200
Europe still is far away from is food

557
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:29,480
products that contain THD cuz we're only

558
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,278
talking about food products contain the

559
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:35,599
can have you know CBD so we're still far

560
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:37,960
for from that process and I think you're

561
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:41,719
right it's until it's not seen as a

562
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,079
narcotic from the foods perspective then

563
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,519
it's hard to see how that's going to

564
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:46,678
happen any day soon I'm not sure how

565
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:48,960
much time we've got because there's no

566
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:51,880
timer on us so

567
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,640
um I could leave some questions now for

568
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,919
the audience before I can continue I

569
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,159
might have a few but if there's any

570
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,440
questions from the

571
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:00,440
audience um

572
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:06,400
uh there's no guys with mics they've

573
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:13,719
left we B we've bored we've bored the

574
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:16,158
organizers on food there we go they've

575
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,759
all left the building yeah do you have

576
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:22,000
an idea of uh how long this could take

577
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:24,359
to have the first uh novel food

578
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,720
authorization on CBD we have for example

579
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:29,278
some synthetic applications where you

580
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,640
have no risk of d they've returned to

581
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:34,839
the building the first

582
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:37,480
ones and the and the first yeah the

583
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:40,158
first ones uh are the assessment is

584
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,038
expiring this year so uh we were really

585
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:45,240
wondering if this year something will

586
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:46,759
come out or it will take longer thanks

587
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,798
thank you I think I can take that

588
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:50,919
because for I think this is the

589
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:54,319
complication of the FSA because epsa is

590
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:56,480
not one body but contains several

591
00:24:54,319 --> 00:25:00,398
subcommittees so to bring it through

592
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,880
this kind of let me say ODC of bodies is

593
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:04,519
this is why I'm taking and this is why I

594
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,080
mentioned the sample of the probiotics

595
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:08,679
you know which is so clear for us for

596
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:11,839
more than 25 years and still you know we

597
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:14,240
are not having valid claims um although

598
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:17,918
you know so many um even big companies

599
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,440
nestly supplied uh a lot of data so I

600
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,360
cannot predict anything as a good lawyer

601
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,000
I will not tell you uh give you any bad

602
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:27,240
promises no the situation is still open

603
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
and you all know that CBD was meanwhile

604
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:32,038
even under control substance uh which

605
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,079
then has been stopped fortunately

606
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:35,558
because there was also no

607
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:37,879
pharmacological reason for that so I

608
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:40,038
think the situation is Still Remains

609
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,480
unclear and we are delivered to the

610
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:45,158
mercy of the

611
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,440
authority okay I got it I got it get out

612
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:50,799

that hi thank you very much um my name

616
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:02,359
is Marine um I wanted to ask uh 2 years

617
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:05,879
ago was it 3 years ago there was a

618
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:09,759
Polish Court uh which decided that hemp

619
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:12,360
Leaf extracts are not novel food uh this

620
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:13,960
made quite some waves um but

621
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:17,798
unfortunately I haven't heard anything

622
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:19,880
is there a reply from the the FSA uh

623
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:22,200
rebuking it or yeah but hemp is not a

624
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,000
problem hemp never been a problem seed

625
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,200
is not a problem this everything is

626
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,599
allowed well it is a problem in Germany

627
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,200
we have a lot of cases where people are

628
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:32,199
not allowed to sell because they say

629
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,720
there's still novel food in application

630
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,798
it is they get they get they get the the

631
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,079
letter I can give you later the the page

632
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:42,558
of the um of the Authority for food and

633
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:45,119
there's clearly stated that seed that

634
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:47,720
hemp is not a problem SE I'm talking

635
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:50,319
about the leaves and the flowers okay

636
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:53,798
because the I don't know if everybody

637
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:56,158
get grinded there was a um um one of the

638
00:26:53,798 --> 00:26:58,759
biggest chocolate brands R sport has

639
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,520
created a cannabis chocolate which was

640
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:03,960
of course based based on on hemp they

641
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:06,639
had the the Cannabis Le in front they

642
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:09,880
made a kind of few batches but then it

643
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,640
disappeared I don't know why if it was

644
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,080
some kind of admonition because they

645
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:17,919
said um I don't know so uh just threeory

646
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:20,038
but they made some chocolate which was

647
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,679
of course with hemp and not with

648
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:24,480
cannabis so as one of the biggest

649
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:27,840
chocolate brands I don't they are not

650
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,759
very risk uh adaptive so I am sure that

651
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,119
um there was some clarification that

652
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:34,278
that this is possible and of course we

653
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:38,119
have hemp oil we have yeah I was just

654
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:41,200
going to add to that so the flour like

655
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:43,518
in most of European uh countries and in

656
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,159
the UK when it comes to food it's a

657
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:48,359
controlled substance so on that side of

658
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:51,200
things it's very difficult to say that

659
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:55,639
that's not novel as a food so I I

660
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:59,000
haven't seen the Polish um uh discussion

661
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:01,519
from 1997 stated from the

662
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,919
EU yeah okay look we've got to be

663
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:06,359
careful okay as I explained right at the

664
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,600
beginning if it's not been in there was

665
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:14,639
a big big case that went before Brussels

666
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:17,918
before uh 2019 that um tried to quash

667
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,679
the notion that CBD wasn't novel now I'm

668
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,200
not I'm not arguing for that or against

669
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:24,960
it I'm not a scientist that that

670
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,759
discussion happened that discussion

671
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,759
actually came from the uh UK it was

672
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:34,599
actually the CTA and I think um I

673
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:37,398
forgotten the European um counterpart

674
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:39,959
that put an application or or statement

675
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:42,319
to Brussels to say CBD is not novel it's

676
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,240
been in our dietry system uh and so on

677
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:46,038
and so forth hemp's been around for

678
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,079
hundreds if not thousands of years and

679
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:49,759
they lost I don't know why they lost I

680
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:51,519
wasn't there I didn't argue the points

681
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:54,158
but they lost on a technicality I

682
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,919
believe I could be wrong and it was it

683
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,760
was after that that they made the

684
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,679
announcements at CBD as an extracted

685
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:03,440
form was novel and if if it was going to

686
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,759
be contained in food it had to go

687
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,080
through this novel Foods process all

688
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:08,599
right I hate to have to cut you off but

689
