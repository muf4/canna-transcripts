1
00:00:01,338 --> 00:00:10,639
all right so our next panel deals with a

2
00:00:05,649 --> 00:00:14,149
very important cannabinoid CBD so the

3
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:16,608
ABCs of CBD CBD may not be as fun as THC

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:20,480
but it has great medicinal values and

5
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:22,519
there is a big and growing market for

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,149
CBD so I will introduce the moderator

7
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:28,640
who will then talk introduce the other

8
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:29,329
speakers he is the CEO of ciske you

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,699
sun-grown

10
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:34,189
vertically integrated cannabis and hip

11
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:37,750
producer and processor who last year had

12
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:40,309
a cannabis field and our adult use uh

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:43,070
don't use scanners filled in a hip field

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,240
side by side tongue twister there thank

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:57,019
you so give it up for mr. Michael

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:58,790
Johnson thanks everybody so I want to

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,290
thank Alex for having us here today and

18
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:02,659
doing this panel on CBD

19
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:04,129
I think the CBD opportunity here

20
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:06,530
nationally internationally but

21
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:09,320
especially here in Oregon is is a really

22
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,820
special thing we have right now we have

23
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:13,008
some great experts on the team today

24
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:13,779
we've got cedar gray CEO of Cisco

25
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:15,858
sun-grown

26
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,049
Cedars been a pioneer in the Oregon

27
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:20,748
cannabis industry and in the CBD market

28
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:23,359
for many years currently sits on the

29
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:26,179
Oregon cannabis commission and many

30
00:01:23,358 --> 00:01:28,818
other rules advisory committees next

31
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:32,240
we've got Justin Tom Bay with fight onyx

32
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:35,689
fight onyx specializes in CBD hemp seed

33
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:38,328
breeding genetics and their real pioneer

34
00:01:35,688 --> 00:01:40,669
in Southern Oregon who's been working to

35
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:43,129
sell genetics and cultivate genetics for

36
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:46,179
companies all around the country last

37
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:50,118
we've got Aaron Pelle with cultiva law

38
00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:52,969
Aaron's a hemp CBD cannabis specialist

39
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:55,728
lawyer litigator he's based out of

40
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:59,239
Seattle but grateful to have him here

41
00:01:55,728 --> 00:02:02,239
for the legal perspective on CBD as many

42
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:04,519
you know the opportunity with CBD is

43
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,079
massive but there's a lot of confusion

44
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:07,959
around

45
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:10,569
compound depends on what lawyer you ask

46
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:12,729
what expert you ask and often you get a

47
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:15,280
different answer based on what you can

48
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:16,989
do what's legal what's not how you can

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,120
do it where you can send it where you

50
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,460
can grow it so I'm hoping that we can

51
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,439
give you just you know a rough outline

52
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,870
of how to get into the market how to

53
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:30,909
approach it and some basic do's and

54
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:32,560
don'ts so first when I research CBD it's

55
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:36,039
clear that there's a lot of confusion

56
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,539
around is this even legal on a national

57
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:39,669
perspective and an international

58
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:41,500
perspective so Aaron I want to know if

59
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:43,989
you wanted to jump in and maybe answer

60
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:49,060
that question is is CBD legal on a

61
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:50,860
national level that question that's a

62
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,349
it's it's a it's an interesting question

63
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:56,230
and it's one that no real attorney wants

64
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:59,609
to put their their name on in its

65
00:02:56,229 --> 00:03:02,530
entirety so it's it's it's about it as

66
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:05,459
unclear as it could be we have competing

67
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,629
agencies including our Congress who's

68
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,530
essentially attacking the purse strings

69
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:13,810
to prevent the Department of Justice and

70
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,400
from from doing anything as it relates

71
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:19,180
to the farm bill Act but the farm bill

72
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:22,150
act itself was recently this was just a

73
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,219
few months ago and was went to the Ninth

74
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,569
Circuit where they were asking for some

75
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:28,359
clarity the same kind of clarity that

76
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:30,849
they asked for several years earlier and

77
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,860
got some clarity and what the Ninth

78
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:35,469
Circuit came back was a procedural

79
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:38,380
motion our procedural action that said

80
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:41,859
that they had lost on on their failure

81
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:43,539
to present this during the comments

82
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,680
period so they were barred from pretty

83
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:46,419
much bringing this action and getting

84
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,060
this clarity but they still threw some

85
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:53,589
clarity in there anyways saying that the

86
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:55,209
agricultural act did preempt the CSA

87
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,280
which is the controlled substance act so

88
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:58,900
that was really good news but then the

89
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,759
bad news was that it wasn't it was an

90
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,200
unpublished opinion it doesn't have the

91
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:03,518
force of law and they literally put in

92
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:06,849
asterisks next to it saying it was a

93
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,200
memorandum so there's there is there is

94
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:10,599
an opinion out there that says that it

95
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:12,259
is but we keep getting a lot of really

96
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:16,219
negative feedback from the D

97
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:19,969
and the FDA saying that it's not so it's

98
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:22,130
about as clear as mud thanks Aaron yeah

99
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,840
it's uh that's a similar answer I've

100
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:25,339
heard from other attorneys it's uh it's

101
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,009
frustrating that we don't have more

102
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:29,899
clarity but with what's clear with you

103
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:32,000
know with cedar and with Justin and many

104
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:34,519
other companies here in Oregon they are

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,029
having a lot of success with CBD grown

106
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:40,849
in state legal hemp programs one

107
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:43,549
question I get asked a lot is what's the

108
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:46,100
difference between hemp and cannabis and

109
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,770
when CBDs involved like what's going on

110
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,939
here where's that line drawn didn't know

111
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:54,500
cedar do you want to give us just a

112
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:57,350
little historical background yeah

113
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,430
okay so there's multiple definitions of

114
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:02,120
hemp

115
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:05,569
it's very confusing right now for the

116
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:08,629
consumer in the marketplace I think and

117
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:11,029
that's because we've got a botanical

118
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:12,850
definition a historical definition and a

119
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:18,228
legal definition

120
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:22,340
botanically speaking well hemp Falls

121
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:27,219
with all other cannabis in the cannabis

122
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:29,869
family one of two families and the

123
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:34,580
excuse me in the cannabis genus one of

124
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:41,689
two geniuses in the cannabis EA family

125
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:44,079
hops being the other there's fierce

126
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:47,598
debate going on right now in the

127
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:53,560
botanical scientific community about the

128
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:59,089
exact subdivisions of the cannabis genus

129
00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:01,819
whether indica ruderalis and sativa are

130
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:05,448
different subspecies are different

131
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:08,750
species all belong to one species so

132
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:12,379
that's a current debate but what's clear

133
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:16,848
is hemp and all other forms of cannabis

134
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:20,740
fall within the cannabis family and most

135
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:23,099
of the variation that we see

136
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:27,840
in cannabis plants throughout the world

137
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:31,350
is due to thousands of years of human

138
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:36,339
cultivation local natural selection

139
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:37,689
pressures combined with humans choosing

140
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:42,039
the cultivars that they wanted to

141
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:46,740
propagate and so over the centuries

142
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:51,790
that's given us a vast array of

143
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:54,040
diversity within the cannabis family so

144
00:06:51,790 --> 00:07:00,419
that comes to the historical definition

145
00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:06,870
historically hemp most recently has come

146
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:11,139
to refer to the cultivars of cannabis

147
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:16,149
that were chosen for fiber for fiber

148
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:18,790
production and those cultivars had

149
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:24,429
specific physical characteristics

150
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:27,250
now however all of that has been muddied

151
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,079
by the legal definition here in the

152
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,788
United States it was started by federal

153
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:35,490
regulation it's been mirrored by most

154
00:07:30,788 --> 00:07:39,550
states where hemp is a cannabis plant

155
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:43,389
that's certified to be less than 0.3

156
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:47,050
percent THC and is grown under the

157
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:49,769
proper regulatory framework so it has

158
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:53,110
nothing to do with historical use or

159
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:56,799
botanical definitions in fact the exact

160
00:07:53,110 --> 00:08:00,660
same plant grown under the ODA oregon

161
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:04,090
department of agriculture or the olcc

162
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,740
would be hemp or not just because it

163
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:10,959
grew under a different regulatory

164
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:14,650
framework so that is the somewhat murky

165
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,909
answer to what is him interesting

166
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:17,560
interesting

167
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:20,289
you know we know there's a huge market

168
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,970
for CBD products within the medical

169
00:08:20,288 --> 00:08:24,519
cannabis systems of different states

170
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:27,190
within the recreational system here in

171
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:29,649
oregon we at Siskiyou sun-grown sell a

172
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:31,810
lot of CBD products in the recreational

173
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:33,870
cannabis system but now we have this

174
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,969
national marketplace and international

175
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,360
marketplace that's starting to explode

176
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:41,550
with CBD products everything from you

177
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,560
know vape pens and capsules to putting

178
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:45,569
it in two different food products and I

179
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,759
think the the trends are really

180
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,260
interesting I think Justin I know you've

181
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,259
got some insights you were just at a

182
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:53,700
show down in Anaheim and I'm just

183
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:55,528
curious what your thoughts are and like

184
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,970
the evolving trends moving forward with

185
00:08:55,528 --> 00:09:03,838
the CBD marketplace sure this is a

186
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:07,139
really vibrant market that's it's not

187
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,720
going away it's going to grow rapidly

188
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:11,789
I think sales this year were estimated

189
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,490
somewhere in the neighborhood of six

190
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:18,990
hundred million dollars and with the

191
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:20,250
introduction of the 2018 farm act even

192
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,490
though that's not out of committee yet

193
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:26,039
it is in fact changing the projections

194
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,549
for market size just a couple of years

195
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:31,769
ago in 2016 folks who are looking at the

196
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:33,929
the CBD market and that's only a part of

197
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:35,699
hemp right and a part of the cannabis

198
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:38,189
world but the CBD market has been worth

199
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,440
something like two billion dollars two

200
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,330
point one in 2020 well now that's

201
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,900
revised to be twenty two billion dollars

202
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:47,190
by 2022 so there's the market

203
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,299
forecasters are looking they're seeing

204
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,850
the trends they're seeing that

205
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:52,528
governments here both state and

206
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:56,790
federally in the US and internationally

207
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:59,039
our making room for this and you know

208
00:09:56,789 --> 00:10:00,569
the cannabis industry has as you all

209
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,299
know operated in the gray zone and the

210
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:06,330
margins for a long time the people here

211
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:08,669
are entrepreneurs and and risk takers

212
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:11,190
and so the industry is it's pushing

213
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:14,458
forward to sort of make the changes that

214
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,779
the regulatory regulatory bodies are

215
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:18,509
catching up to you in a lot of instances

216
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:20,458
so I sit on the Oregon industrial hemp

217
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:22,830
farmers association here in Oregon and

218
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:24,869
we advise a lot of times the ODA in the

219
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,600
state about what they need to consider

220
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:31,379
and how to approach regulating the

221
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:35,300
cultivation of hemp and the aspects of

222
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:37,830
the byproducts that come out of it so

223
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:40,679
back to the question sort of is it legal

224
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:42,810
or not you have a federal authorized

225
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:45,239
program that lets States set certain

226
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,199
regulatory frameworks here in Oregon you

227
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,990
know we work

228
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,270
under the auspices of this pilot or

229
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,860
research program under the Department of

230
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:54,629
Agriculture and that's what the the

231
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,039
template is out there for folks so

232
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:58,529
there's a big distinction right there

233
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:01,099
suddenly we're able to cultivate a kind

234
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:05,159
of cannabis that's legally defined as

235
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:07,009
0.3 percent THC or less and even that

236
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:11,610
there's multiple interpretations of that

237
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:14,220
as an agricultural product so here an

238
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,960
organ that means that we can have kids

239
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,540
on the farm we don't have to have

240
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:21,570
cameras everywhere watching where the

241
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:24,620
hemp is being grown processed stored etc

242
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:27,000
right so that already creates sort of a

243
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:30,509
more streamlined process and a broader

244
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,980
access and you're seeing a ramp up of

245
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:39,059
production in these high CBD hemp

246
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:42,870
strains that is is feeding this market

247
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:46,619
and is going to is literally exploding

248
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:49,049
in front of our eyes so I do understand

249
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:52,350
that there's there's a lot of unanswered

250
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:56,339
questions and a gray area as to the

251
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:59,070
exact legality and exact mechanisms that

252
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:01,259
we are supposed to follow in order to be

253
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:04,560
compliant but it will also say that the

254
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:07,830
market is is active that the businesses

255
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:11,039
are operating in at minimum 38 states

256
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:14,330
right now and that CBD products are

257
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:18,019
being sold in all 50 states and

258
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:21,960
internationally we went to Europe last

259
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:27,299
well earlier this year in the spring and

260
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:29,820
and hemp cultivation therefore CBD is

261
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:31,769
just starting to kind of catch up

262
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,270
cannabis cultivation for CBD is just

263
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:35,759
starting to catch up they've been doing

264
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:37,829
it for fiber and seed for a long time

265
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,409
same thing in Canada and just went over

266
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:43,879
to British Columbia for the Pacific Rim

267
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:46,740
hemp conference there and they have had

268
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:48,649
something in the neighborhood of 130 140

269
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:52,169
thousand acres of hemp under cultivation

270
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:54,809
in the previous year again mostly for

271
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:56,219
hemp part seeds and some parts for fiber

272
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:59,669
they're all trying to figure out how to

273
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:01,230
pivot to CBD production because this is

274
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:07,860
the lucrative part of the market is

275
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:11,220
right now and so you know the the market

276
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:13,740
for even just CBD flower as an

277
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,560
alternative substitute or supplement to

278
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,149
tobacco smoking products in Europe is

279
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:21,719
huge

280
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:25,620
so it's a it's a big market there's a

281
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,240
lot of different ways that that you can

282
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:31,259
participate in the market if you're

283
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:35,100
involved in in the whole value chain

284
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:37,649
right and and I think we're just gonna

285
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,680
see a lot of diversification from beauty

286
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:46,379
and health care products to edibles and

287
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:51,000
meta bulls and adjustables to to again a

288
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:54,419
more standard smoking market that is all

289
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,480
happening parallel to the existing

290
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:59,000
cannabis markets and and infrastructure

291
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,680
that were familiar with

292
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,379
awesome awesome yeah I mean the the

293
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,239
potential is just it's it's amazing it's

294
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:07,529
really exciting to see all the myriad of

295
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,379
products that are happening all the

296
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:12,569
markets that are opening up it's it's

297
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:14,240
clear though that we need support from

298
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:17,040
our governments both state and federal

299
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,409
to be able to expand this market and

300
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:22,620
there's a lot of rumblings right now in

301
00:14:19,409 --> 00:14:24,419
the CBD industry about the hemp bill or

302
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:28,259
the sari the farm bill that's coming up

303
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:29,959
here in 2018 that's a huge bill I don't

304
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:32,639
even know how large it is it encompasses

305
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,710
all sorts of agricultural issues in the

306
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,279
United States but I know it's going to

307
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:39,600
affect the CBD market significantly

308
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,399
Aaron are you able to give us a little

309
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,320
update on the farm bill and where it's

310
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:47,309
at and how that might affect the CBD

311
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:49,379
hemp market I made a joke by looking at

312
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:50,669
my watch earlier because we do it seems

313
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:53,549
like we do have a kind of a pending

314
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:56,849
deadline in terms of that coming out

315
00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:59,039
soon by the end of this month mitch

316
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:01,590
mcconnell's behind it on one side in

317
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,870
legislature so most people believe it's

318
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:05,009
going to go through whether that's a

319
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,950
good thing or a bad thing kind of

320
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:09,569
remains to be seen one of the one of the

321
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:12,080
versions of the bill on one side of the

322
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,649
legislature doesn't allow felons

323
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,170
previous felons to be

324
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:19,198
involved which really the best growers

325
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:20,849
of most cannabis if they if they aren't

326
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:22,378
felons it's a practically a badge of

327
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,670
honor it means you might have been

328
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:26,278
better at your job than others but

329
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:28,259
honestly excluding entire groups of

330
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:31,230
people based on what I consider very

331
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:34,318
unfair new Jim Crow laws in the first

332
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,639
place are wildly inappropriate when

333
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:38,009
you're when you're excluding an entire

334
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,769
group of people from being involved in

335
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:41,970
this market so I I see a lot of problems

336
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:43,499
with it but the big problem that

337
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:46,800
everybody should be scared of it also is

338
00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:48,689
is not just consolidation but the

339
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,149
coca-cola announcement like these guys

340
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:53,458
are telegraphing a whole change in the

341
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:55,678
market that doesn't include you any of

342
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:58,888
you unless somebody's from coca-cola

343
00:15:55,678 --> 00:16:00,659
here they're these are gigantic

344
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:03,169
companies that are coming in that can

345
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:06,088
deal with the FDA that can deal with

346
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:08,789
making claims about whether this has

347
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:11,970
some sort of medical benefit or not and

348
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:14,428
so every day in some ways I look at this

349
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,980
similar to what I saw in Washington when

350
00:16:14,428 --> 00:16:18,480
we add medical marijuana and that we

351
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,759
have this diversity of people that are

352
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,170
involved in the CBD market that think

353
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,419
that it should be free there's people

354
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:26,188
that think that it should that are

355
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:28,378
activists that are involved in it there

356
00:16:26,188 --> 00:16:30,419
are people that are capitalists that are

357
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:33,600
involved in it but but that that

358
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:35,428
diversity of opinion means nothing to

359
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,230
the people that would move this forward

360
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:39,688
because they worship one God and that's

361
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,129
money and so we all have something to

362
00:16:39,688 --> 00:16:42,990
kind of be afraid of because we have

363
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:45,149
this mom-and-pop sort of effect going on

364
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:47,308
that it that is questionable whether it

365
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:49,438
will survive something that's going to

366
00:16:47,308 --> 00:16:50,759
be consolidated under the federal

367
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:52,740
government one of the versions of the

368
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,600
farm bill act requires that the federal

369
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,928
government does approve any state

370
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,220
program before we're involved before we

371
00:16:57,928 --> 00:17:02,039
can actually implement that state

372
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,509
program so again another fear could be

373
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:04,769
similar to something that the government

374
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:06,328
does all the time which is they create a

375
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:08,639
bill they write something and then they

376
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:11,068
don't fund it I don't know that that

377
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,049
will happen or not there's a lot of I

378
00:17:11,068 --> 00:17:14,639
consider heavy hitters involved in this

379
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:16,439
industry that want to see that bill go

380
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,288
through and push forward and see it

381
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,390
funded so but like I say I look at it

382
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:24,109
with some at least a measure of

383
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:27,240
skepticism for what happens next

384
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:30,419
yeah interesting interesting

385
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,220
you know CBD is just it's a compound

386
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:35,580
right it's it's a cannabinoid so you can

387
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:37,410
grow it in many systems cedar was one of

388
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:40,109
the the very first people that I knew

389
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:42,269
that was growing CBD rich cultivars and

390
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:44,549
making CBD products in the Oregon

391
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:46,500
Medical Marijuana Program and then

392
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:49,289
transitioned and began doing that in the

393
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,779
recreational cannabis program and is now

394
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:53,879
doing so in the hemp program

395
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,700
I'm curious cedar maybe you want to talk

396
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,559
about what would be the advantages of

397
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,630
going forward with your CBD products in

398
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,819
the Oregon Department of Agriculture

399
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:04,350
hemp program rather than in those other

400
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:08,909
state license programs so you have

401
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:12,539
experience and yeah there are multiple

402
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:17,330
distinct advantages let's start with

403
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:19,740
regulatory the regulatory framework of

404
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:23,279
hemp production under the Oregon

405
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:28,470
Department of Agriculture is infinitely

406
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:35,160
less complex than farming under the olcc

407
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:41,130
requirements that you know reduced

408
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:48,660
complexity translates to well profits

409
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:53,490
and happiness and so yeah that's that's

410
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:56,460
a I mean that that's a huge benefit

411
00:18:53,490 --> 00:19:01,259
right there it ties right into another

412
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:05,910
great benefit and that's the IRS tax

413
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:09,859
code 280e horse consult with your CPA

414
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:12,170
about this but most hemp businesses

415
00:19:09,859 --> 00:19:18,949
considered themselves to be exempt from

416
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:22,580
280e 280e is a tax code which denies

417
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:25,740
cannabis businesses most write-offs

418
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:27,480
resulting in a very hostile business

419
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:30,339
environment in which its

420
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:33,659
challenging to turn a profit because

421
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:36,730
most of the profit is taken by the IRS

422
00:19:33,659 --> 00:19:40,059
comparatively speaking a typical

423
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:45,849
business run exactly the same way that's

424
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:50,829
not subject to 280 II might have four or

425
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:51,969
five times the profit and let's move to

426
00:19:50,829 --> 00:19:55,918
the market place

427
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:58,450
here in the Oregon cannabis market it's

428
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,538
not news to anybody here that the

429
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:05,319
markets flooded and prices are at an

430
00:20:01,538 --> 00:20:08,500
all-time low you know that's good news

431
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:10,778
for consumers consumers and patients so

432
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,849
I don't want to deny that fact I think

433
00:20:10,778 --> 00:20:14,648
cannabis and hemp products should be

434
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:19,209
cheaper and cheaper forever for

435
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:24,519
everybody so that is a benefit however

436
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:30,009
it's a sudden shift the downward price

437
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:33,548
pressure has been extreme and it's it's

438
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:38,679
a difficult time in the Oregon cannabis

439
00:20:33,548 --> 00:20:40,990
industry export which has been discussed

440
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:44,528
on other panels is the Silver Bullet

441
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,899
which will cure those woes but we don't

442
00:20:44,528 --> 00:20:50,648
deal with that at all on the hemp side

443
00:20:45,898 --> 00:20:55,298
hemp is a worldwide market you know hemp

444
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:57,729
can be well individual jurisdictions are

445
00:20:55,298 --> 00:21:00,308
shifting their regulations regarding

446
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:03,460
hemp on a daily basis but more or less

447
00:21:00,308 --> 00:21:07,678
hemp can be mail are shipped to every

448
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:10,000
state and in the United States and

449
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,419
potentially to most countries around the

450
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,599
world so we've got 7 billion people who

451
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:20,259
can benefit from CBD that we produce

452
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:21,819
here in Oregon compared to you know 4

453
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:26,500
million people plus the tourists who

454
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:29,019
come to Oregon on the cannabis side and

455
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:34,558
I think the final benefit that I want to

456
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:34,558
highlight is all of these combined

457
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:40,990
to create the opportunity to offer

458
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:43,149
cannabis medicine at a vastly reduced

459
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:46,690
price to the national and worldwide

460
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:49,710
market through CBD in some ways I think

461
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:52,269
CBD is a gateway cannabinoid for humans

462
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:55,900
because it's not psychoactive people

463
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:58,329
aren't afraid of it like they are THC so

464
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:01,019
it's introducing the entire world to the

465
00:21:58,329 --> 00:22:05,199
incredible benefit of cannabis medicine

466
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:08,379
in a safe and affordable way so that's a

467
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,440
great benefit thank you yeah absolutely

468
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:13,600
thank you cedar it's it's exciting to

469
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,460
see cannabis medicine like you say

470
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:18,099
having some barriers pulled down and

471
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:21,340
allowing entrepreneurs to start to to

472
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:23,109
tackle these larger markets but Justin I

473
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:25,179
know you know you've experienced some of

474
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:28,179
the challenges getting into the CBD hemp

475
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:30,610
industry firsthand you know it's it

476
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,740
seems so much easier than being a

477
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:34,929
recreational cannabis entrepreneur or a

478
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,870
medical cannabis entrepreneur but it's

479
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:39,070
not without its its pitfalls so maybe

480
00:22:37,869 --> 00:22:40,629
you could detail just some of the

481
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:42,490
challenges that you've experienced or

482
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:48,430
that people should be ready for if they

483
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:50,410
plan to enter this market sure I think I

484
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,789
have to you know preface that with this

485
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:54,250
definitely comes from the perspective

486
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:56,769
that I'm approaching it from participant

487
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:59,230
in the the hemp cultivation side of

488
00:22:56,769 --> 00:23:00,549
things CBD is also present in other

489
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:03,940
forms of cannabis and people are

490
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:05,889
bringing different strains that can be

491
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,809
one-to-one races or whatnot inside of

492
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:09,490
medical programs in the state so I'm

493
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:11,829
coming from the perspective of again

494
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:14,170
agriculture so now we're dealing with

495
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:16,869
things that tens of acres or hundreds of

496
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,860
acres or even thousands of acres there

497
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:19,629
were several thousand acres under

498
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:23,649
cultivation in Oregon

499
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:27,130
this year and of hemp almost entirely

500
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:30,160
for its high CBD content and that is

501
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:31,690
then targeted for extraction into some

502
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:36,070
kind of a concentrate that's going to be

503
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:39,190
used in an end products right so when

504
00:23:36,069 --> 00:23:41,139
you scale up activities like that you

505
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,120
know there's there's all the attendant

506
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,929
capital investments you have to make you

507
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:45,518
have to

508
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:46,570
your logistics your cost how you're

509
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:48,519
gonna get through to the end but there

510
00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:51,428
are certain parts of an infrastructure

511
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:53,859
you know for this to be a real industry

512
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:55,360
either statewide or nationally that are

513
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:58,449
just not there at all yet

514
00:23:55,359 --> 00:24:00,758
and so choices are being made in a

515
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:03,669
vacuum of clear guidance about the best

516
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:05,950
way to develop that infrastructure and

517
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:07,450
and this is in partly the fact that you

518
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:09,788
know at the federal level our government

519
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:11,319
is dragging its feet about providing

520
00:24:09,788 --> 00:24:11,829
clarity they're trying to hold on to

521
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:14,408
this

522
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:15,970
this bastion of this being a controlled

523
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:17,820
substance and it needs to be really

524
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:20,769
firmly regulated for as long as possible

525
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:25,509
so what does that mean that means if I

526
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:27,368
want to cure my hemp right or any of our

527
00:24:25,509 --> 00:24:30,788
farmers who gorge a next one cure our

528
00:24:27,368 --> 00:24:32,709
hemp in order to then be able to extract

529
00:24:30,788 --> 00:24:34,359
it they can't go to the the old

530
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:37,119
tried-and-true methods that cannabis

531
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:39,668
growers have been using for you know

532
00:24:37,118 --> 00:24:42,628
four decades at this scale it just

533
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:47,019
doesn't work you can't hang you know

534
00:24:42,628 --> 00:24:49,298
fifty thousand pounds of dry weight hemp

535
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:51,490
in in a little space and expect that

536
00:24:49,298 --> 00:24:53,710
you're gonna be able to to handle that

537
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:57,240
on a logistical level so whether it's

538
00:24:53,710 --> 00:25:01,990
from you know the the front side end of

539
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:03,490
planting irrigating you know cultivating

540
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:05,470
to the back side end of harvesting

541
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:07,240
whether to do that you know mechanically

542
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,038
and what kind of equipment is available

543
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,829
out there and then how you're going to

544
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:14,200
dry cure process to transport all of

545
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:17,168
that infrastructure is still really in

546
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,298
nascent forms of development so a lot of

547
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:23,080
people have put hemp in the ground and

548
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:24,970
then had no clue what to do when it

549
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:26,618
comes to fall and the rains are starting

550
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,548
to fall and they're trying to figure out

551
00:25:26,618 --> 00:25:32,408
how to get there

552
00:25:27,548 --> 00:25:34,720
their crop off the field and so it does

553
00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:36,580
take a lot of forethought and careful

554
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,909
planning the other thing that you know

555
00:25:36,579 --> 00:25:42,788
we're involved directly if I Thomas with

556
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:45,249
with breeding and so in order to meet

557
00:25:42,788 --> 00:25:46,839
the federal regulations and grow

558
00:25:45,249 --> 00:25:51,368
something is hemp you have to be

559
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:54,878
qualified with a variety that is

560
00:25:51,368 --> 00:25:57,909
supposed to mature at less than 0.3 THC

561
00:25:54,878 --> 00:26:00,939
the federal language is Delta 9 THC

562
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:03,940
which makes our job easier because much

563
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:07,960
of the THC content at harvest is teal

564
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:09,789
still THC a but difference which means

565
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,779
that it hasn't been decarboxylated to

566
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:16,480
become Delta 9 THC but there are some

567
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:19,359
states Kentucky for example which is

568
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,279
another you know center of a lot of hemp

569
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:26,409
cultivation right now they apply a

570
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:29,379
conversion ratio to your THC a and they

571
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:33,000
say you know 0.87 7 % of that is gonna

572
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:35,590
be Delta 9 JC so if you harvest too late

573
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,650
in Kentucky

574
00:26:35,589 --> 00:26:40,029
your THC levels will be out of

575
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:43,090
compliance and by the law you're

576
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:45,129
supposed to destroy your crop so that

577
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:46,589
kind of lack of clarity of state to

578
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:49,000
state to state about Uniform Standards

579
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:50,349
can leave folks in Tennessee and

580
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,750
Kentucky in North Carolina where we've

581
00:26:50,349 --> 00:26:54,069
been out we've sold our seeds we've

582
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:56,049
we've been consulting with old tobacco

583
00:26:54,069 --> 00:26:57,669
farmers you know who are trying to make

584
00:26:56,049 --> 00:27:01,240
this transition can leave them really up

585
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:05,529
in the air and really uncertain as to

586
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:08,410
how to best proceed lastly I would say

587
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:11,859
that getting good genetics or good seed

588
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:15,269
stock to start with can be really

589
00:27:11,859 --> 00:27:17,558
challenging in this and this current

590
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:21,400
unregulated kind of Wild West state of

591
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:25,058
the industry I know personally you know

592
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:27,790
here in Oregon and in multiple states

593
00:27:25,058 --> 00:27:29,940
folks who on good faith bought seeds

594
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:32,470
that were represented to them as a

595
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:36,370
feminized hemp strain that would be

596
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:39,339
compliant and the the aspect of having

597
00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:41,289
feminized seed is important to cannabis

598
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:44,199
cultivators all around who don't want to

599
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:45,549
have their fields pollinated by the hemp

600
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,279
field it's two miles down the road

601
00:27:45,549 --> 00:27:50,200
that's 40 acres and just you know went

602
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:51,970
seed and threw a bunch of pollen into

603
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:56,170
the wind and and now everybody else's

604
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:58,089
crop is is seated as a result and in

605
00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:01,330
fact then found out that those seeds

606
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:03,220
either weren't feminized or weren't

607
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:05,079
actually compliant hemp or didn't

608
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,000
germinate there are horror stories upon

609
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:08,960
horror stories upon horror stories out

610
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
there so

611
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,679
building relationships doing proper

612
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,169
diligence don't just rely on the word of

613
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:17,179
a broker just because somebody tells you

614
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:18,860
something you know you if you're gonna

615
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:21,200
be involved in this you're gonna have to

616
00:28:18,859 --> 00:28:22,668
dig deeper and you're gonna have to take

617
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,080
the time to do your diligence to make

618
00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:26,299
sure that your fundamental building

619
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,259
blocks that you're working with are good

620
00:28:26,298 --> 00:28:30,710
ones

621
00:28:27,259 --> 00:28:35,179
otherwise you're again gonna have a real

622
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:38,390
hard time come harvest time yeah

623
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:40,100
absolutely thanks Justin yeah in any

624
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:42,200
maturing industry like this there's

625
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:44,359
there's there's pitfalls left and right

626
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,429
there snake oil salesmen there's

627
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:48,349
hucksters and I think the due diligence

628
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:50,149
piece that you pointed out is incredibly

629
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:52,099
important if you're trying to enter the

630
00:28:50,148 --> 00:28:54,158
market and make you know

631
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:57,918
business-to-business partners by seeds

632
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:59,210
all of it is incredibly important so I

633
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,340
think we've we've given a good little

634
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:02,870
overview but we have these experts up

635
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:05,720
here and I'm curious if anybody has any

636
00:29:02,869 --> 00:29:08,989
questions out in the in the audience in

637
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:11,380
Gayo you back there all right man it's

638
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,380
time to work

639
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:20,589
[Music]

640
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:20,589
[Applause]

641
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:27,620
hi I was I was wondering I I assumed

642
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:34,019
that you guys heard about the DEA

643
00:29:27,619 --> 00:29:36,359
rescheduling 0.1% THC CBD products so

644
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:40,168
long as they have FDA approval that just

645
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:42,240
took place yesterday and I was wondering

646
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:45,770
if you could speak to what effect that

647
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:49,278
has how hard is it to get FDA approval

648
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:52,230
what does that look like do mom-and-pop

649
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:54,390
growers have a chance at making that

650
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:58,200
happen that's a doozy

651
00:29:54,390 --> 00:30:00,270
who wants to tackle that one well I'd

652
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,519
only say that well I guess it depends on

653
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:03,778
what kind of mom-and-pop you are so for

654
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:05,609
example I have a client that's in the

655
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:09,119
tobacco industry and one of the things

656
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:11,969
they do is there they get cigars through

657
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:13,648
and so if you want to do a cigar that

658
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:17,610
this tall and go through that entire

659
00:30:13,648 --> 00:30:19,048
process with the FDA it's $15,000 and if

660
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:21,148
you want to do a cigar that's exactly

661
00:30:19,048 --> 00:30:25,619
the same but it's just slightly shorter

662
00:30:21,148 --> 00:30:27,449
it's still $15,000 and up to about 45 so

663
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:29,129
and then just dealing with the FDA

664
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,980
itself and the attorneys that deal with

665
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:34,770
it I mean III can't speak to that and

666
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:36,380
it's uh joyed that it's like asking your

667
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:38,579
mechanic to take out your appendix

668
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,649
probably not the right guy to do it but

669
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:43,319
I can't tell you that it's expensive

670
00:30:40,648 --> 00:30:44,729
it's arduous and it does it's going to

671
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:47,609
take a lot of people out of the market

672
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:48,778
if that's what they have to do strangely

673
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:51,569
I mean most people don't really care

674
00:30:48,778 --> 00:30:53,220
what the DEA says and that has a lot to

675
00:30:51,569 --> 00:30:56,069
do with the Appropriations Act which has

676
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:58,140
been kind of mirrors what's been going

677
00:30:56,069 --> 00:31:01,109
on with marijuana itself which is we've

678
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:03,149
got the Congress legislature

679
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,319
collectively saying you can't do

680
00:31:03,148 --> 00:31:05,849
anything to any of these people because

681
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:07,528
we have a hold of your purse strings and

682
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:10,109
so long as these people are compliant

683
00:31:07,528 --> 00:31:12,089
with the farm bill act and and and the

684
00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:14,639
provisions within and their state laws

685
00:31:12,089 --> 00:31:17,389
you can't touch them and so you have

686
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:22,980
that at least for a couple more days so

687
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:27,120
hang in there did you want to maybe just

688
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:29,460
in the sense that you know this is not

689
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,319
meant to obviously encourage

690
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:34,048
access or make it easier for the

691
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:35,250
mom-and-pops operators right in the same

692
00:31:34,048 --> 00:31:38,058
sense that aaron was talking about

693
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:40,440
consolidation is coming to this industry

694
00:31:38,058 --> 00:31:43,609
the FDA and the DEA are sort of

695
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,528
gatekeepers to try and keep the reins on

696
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:49,019
as long as possible so this is my

697
00:31:46,528 --> 00:31:50,819
opinion so that the the the Giants and

698
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:55,349
agribusiness and and Big Pharma

699
00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:57,178
can be positioned to capitalize when the

700
00:31:55,349 --> 00:32:00,329
regulatory framework allows right so the

701
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:02,669
DEA research licenses are typically with

702
00:32:00,329 --> 00:32:05,579
the universities there they're very

703
00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:07,500
difficult to get so they want you to

704
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:10,740
partner with an existing University and

705
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,659
then the IP rights that often the that

706
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,909
are part of those deals the university

707
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:16,649
wants to have a piece of that so that's

708
00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:20,130
one way that they they sort of keep a

709
00:32:16,648 --> 00:32:24,778
clamp on and again yeah this is a very

710
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:26,510
expensive processes that typically you

711
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:30,179
have to be a really well capitalized

712
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:33,058
business to be able to go through to get

713
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:36,750
these kind of approvals but I would say

714
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:40,230
that you know on at least an initial

715
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:44,159
reading of the the versions of the farm

716
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:45,960
bill 2018 farm act that we see that

717
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,590
there is language that really does

718
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:52,048
provide some clarification in terms of

719
00:32:49,589 --> 00:32:56,389
you know our ability to access take

720
00:32:52,048 --> 00:33:00,168
things to market derivatives of hemp

721
00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:03,419
beyond just seed and stalk and fiber now

722
00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:05,190
clearly not you know no longer being

723
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:07,590
part of the controlled substance act I

724
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:09,090
think this is gonna effectively open the

725
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:10,589
doors more and I'd say there's a window

726
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:12,569
of time here there's a there's a few

727
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:16,648
years whatever that that period of time

728
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:20,548
is where you know entrepreneurial

729
00:33:16,648 --> 00:33:22,319
startup businesses have you know have a

730
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:24,329
chance to really make hay and I would

731
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:26,158
suggest that if you are in that position

732
00:33:24,329 --> 00:33:29,269
leverage the best you can during this

733
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,270
this window of opportunity

734
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:36,480
yeah hi thanks guys what uh what are the

735
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:39,000
current barriers to say a CBD edible

736
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:43,250
being able to sell and transport that

737
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,250
over state lines also internationally

738
00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:57,119
export across state lines regulations

739
00:33:53,009 --> 00:33:59,190
are evolving rapidly but currently it's

740
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:01,469
pretty much a green light to export

741
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:04,680
across state lines but that depends on

742
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:09,199
the jurisdiction that you're exporting

743
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:13,530
into all of the hemp has to be certified

744
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:18,299
as approved by the originating states

745
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:20,640
hemp program and because regulations are

746
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:29,400
always changing for example California

747
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:32,730
just banned CBD and food products so you

748
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:35,099
know it was all of a sudden it's a you

749
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:36,449
know tremendous hit to all those

750
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:40,170
companies who were depending upon that

751
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:43,079
supply chain but so individual

752
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:45,800
jurisdictions are changing the

753
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:49,529
regulations rapidly but in general

754
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:52,350
interstate commerce is open in the

755
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:54,900
United States for CBD for high CBD

756
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:57,380
products or CBD only products

757
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:59,460
yeah and just just to hop in there

758
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:02,250
speaking is from an Oregon

759
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:04,139
entrepreneurial standpoint you need to

760
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:06,239
have a permit from the ODA

761
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:08,579
if you're if you're just talking about

762
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:10,859
making that edible you'd want your Oda

763
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:12,840
hemp handler's permit and then also

764
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:15,450
you'd want a commercial kitchen license

765
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:18,289
if you had those two things and if your

766
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:21,089
end product was below 0.3 percent THC

767
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:24,000
and and tested by a certified Oregon

768
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:27,990
laboratory that would be a legal CBD

769
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:32,219
hemp edible just just to add how goofy

770
00:35:27,989 --> 00:35:34,439
that is in in Washington if you if you

771
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:38,099
want to put hemp into a product of any

772
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,570
type and you've grown that hemp in

773
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:41,190
Washington State you have to be licensed

774
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,780
in Washington State but if you brought

775
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:44,880
some CBDs or hemp from

776
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,320
out of the state and put it into a

777
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,030
product there's no restrictions

778
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,600
whatsoever because we removed it from

779
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:52,769
Schedule one so under state law so I and

780
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,029
I get that's one to illustrate that

781
00:35:52,769 --> 00:35:56,550
legislators trying to catch up with

782
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:58,500
their own rules and so there's these

783
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,640
these swinging gates like it like you

784
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,079
were talking about with California where

785
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:02,219
it's like they were letting everything

786
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:04,289
in and then there's this knee-jerk

787
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:05,219
reaction of going the other way and so

788
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:07,199
we have to be a part of that

789
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:08,789
conversation and kind of good citizens

790
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:10,619
if you're in this market you kind of

791
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:12,420
have a duty to be down there and salem

792
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:13,829
and at those meetings and at those

793
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,869
discussions about what's going to happen

794
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:17,489
with these things and be responsible for

795
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:18,900
for being a part of that there's things

796
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:21,269
going on with CBD nobody wants to talk

797
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:23,940
about like when you make a concentrate

798
00:36:21,269 --> 00:36:25,500
what happens with the THC people don't

799
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,210
talk about it cuz there there's other

800
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:30,059
things going on but the truth is is that

801
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:32,010
if you sit and continuously concentrate

802
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:33,900
something there's a concentration of THC

803
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:36,060
as well and nobody's talking about what

804
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,710
we're doing with that and so if we don't

805
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:39,750
want this knee-jerk reaction because

806
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,550
some legislature starts up with what

807
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:45,750
about the children then you need to be

808
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:47,010
involved to avoid it alright one more

809
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:50,159
question I think and then we're gonna

810
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:53,070
break for lunch yeah hi my question

811
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:56,069
builds on that a bit further a bit

812
00:36:53,070 --> 00:37:01,050
further I extract oil now and have had a

813
00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:03,450
lot of market demand from growing sizes

814
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:06,420
bulk level people commercial you know

815
00:37:03,449 --> 00:37:08,129
operations wanting to put it in their

816
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:12,269
micro breweries or what have you and so

817
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:14,640
I'm curious how you see when they ask me

818
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:15,539
a say if I'm going to Ohio or something

819
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:17,549
like that and they asked me that

820
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:19,800
question they're like okay so we're

821
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:21,630
gonna put this in our product what are

822
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,000
the legalities of us putting this into

823
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:26,849
our product and distribute it locally

824
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,079
within our population I know I don't

825
00:37:26,849 --> 00:37:30,719
know if there's an answer for that but I

826
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,429
get asked that all the time so you don't

827
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:33,989
take that Erin I would only say it's

828
00:37:32,429 --> 00:37:35,789
it's really up to your lawyer and their

829
00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:37,229
lawyer to figure that out and they're

830
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:39,360
right the memo and they'll charge you

831
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:41,219
accordingly I mean it's really and it's

832
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,320
the problem what it is is is as I was

833
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:46,500
saying earlier it's a state to state it

834
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:48,120
berries we've got 38 states that have

835
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,920
rules on this and a bunch of others that

836
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:51,630
don't as these guys pointed out it's in

837
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,099
every state no matter where we go

838
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:55,920
where are they getting it from how are

839
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:58,078
they doing it but lawyers write memos I

840
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,400
I think that kind of give them and their

841
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,260
clients the kind of coverage that they

842
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:12,030
need so that they can move forward and

843
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:15,020
do these things yeah that's the joy

844
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:17,849
being on the tip of the spear baby yeah

845
00:38:15,019 --> 00:38:21,568
brick-and-mortar establishments are

846
00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:27,059
under higher risk because of their

847
00:38:21,568 --> 00:38:29,250
physical location online commerce you

848
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:32,730
know check with your lawyer it appears

849
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:35,429
to be pretty safe but I think in

850
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:38,039
Nebraska and North Dakota if I recall

851
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:39,750
correctly a couple of small

852
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:43,710
brick-and-mortar establishments have

853
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:46,858
been raided for their CBD products you

854
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:48,630
know it's a goin 2003 and the cheong

855
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:50,639
story with the bongs it's like nobody's

856
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:51,809
kidding I get calls regularly now still

857
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:53,940
where people are like can I just sell

858
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:55,859
paraphernalia online it's like well no

859
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:57,480
it's federally illegal I mean this whole

860
00:38:55,858 --> 00:38:59,639
conference is federally illegal this is

861
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:03,030
all a big RICO conspiracy to violate

862
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:04,769
federal law you know so it's it's a

863
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:06,780
question of where your risk levels are

864
00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:08,670
in doing this and then like you were

865
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:11,490
saying it's be the change you want to

866
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:14,010
see so you know I always say only break

867
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:15,029
one law at a time but really more to the

868
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:16,290
point it's like if we're going to do

869
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:18,660
this one thing and this is what we're

870
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:20,639
doing then show the world how to do it

871
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:22,108
right and you know that's that's the

872
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:24,420
figure that's the best I can do with

873
00:39:22,108 --> 00:39:25,889
that okay thank you so much one last

874
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,059
question for real this time because he

875
00:39:25,889 --> 00:39:28,558
was very patient so we're gonna do one

876
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:31,470
more question and then we're gonna break

877
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:33,329
for lunch here we go hey guys I think

878
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:38,608
I've probably met all of you at some

879
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:40,798
point in time I'm have cascade high

880
00:39:38,608 --> 00:39:43,500
we're a cannabis company here in Oregon

881
00:39:40,798 --> 00:39:46,710
we're obviously looking at CBD market

882
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:48,719
expansion nationally two major issues

883
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:51,869
that we've kind of already segue it on

884
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:53,730
which is are you guys mostly doing CBD

885
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:56,760
isolate distillate to be able to keep

886
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:58,318
that THC out or are you just comfortable

887
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,079
when you're doing your processing and in

888
00:39:58,318 --> 00:40:03,358
an extraction if you're moving you know

889
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:07,050
full-spectrum oil

890
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:10,529
I assume it's got THC levels in the 3%

891
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:13,860
area way above the 0.3 and then second

892
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:17,330
question probably cedar for you more

893
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:22,079
than anything else do you or actually

894
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:25,619
Aaron from cultiva do you advise setting

895
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:29,489
up a secondary company to be moving

896
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:32,130
those CVE products because of the risk

897
00:40:29,489 --> 00:40:37,759
confusion there with the olcc cannabis

898
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:37,760
business and any feelings about that

899
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:41,130
okay so I'll handle the first question

900
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:45,950
the second one was a legal question so I

901
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:48,210
won't handle it but okay so for

902
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:52,169
extraction ciske sun-grown

903
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:55,139
we base all of our products on ethanol

904
00:40:52,170 --> 00:41:01,050
extracted oil so we're making a crude

905
00:40:55,139 --> 00:41:04,920
oil and there is an in inter that crude

906
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:08,030
oil will always be above 0.3% THC so

907
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:12,150
it's not a commercial product for us

908
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:14,640
there's that's one of the many gray

909
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:17,460
areas of the law is this intermediate

910
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:19,049
step where the concentration occurs and

911
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,000
then it's formulated into another

912
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:23,100
product and diluted below point three

913
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,980
that's a gray area so there's no

914
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:29,940
concrete answer then it's check with

915
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:33,510
your lawyer but yeah so so the short

916
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:35,700
answer is that we you know our crude oil

917
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:40,440
is not a commercial product except in

918
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:43,319
the olcc system and all of our

919
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:46,679
commercial products are reformulated so

920
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:51,390
that the dilution brings THC below point

921
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:52,799
three thanks thank you thank you very

922
00:41:51,389 --> 00:41:53,879
very much let's hear it again for the

923
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,729
panel

924
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,729
[Applause]
