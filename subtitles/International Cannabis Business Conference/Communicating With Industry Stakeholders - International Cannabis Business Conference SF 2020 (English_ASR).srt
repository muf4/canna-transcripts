1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,669
I would like to run down our panel here

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:12,990
and do a little quick introduction to my

3
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:17,550

6
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:23,850
is my maiden voyage here as a panel

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,410
moderator and I was told my first

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,080
question was terrible so I'm gonna cross

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,518
that one out but I would like to sort of

10
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,589
go just go down the row and have

11
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,509
everyone have a chance to sort of give

12
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:34,950
their background where they're from and

13
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:37,469
and how long they've been involved in

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:41,250
the industry awesome can you guys all

15
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:43,320
hear me thank you Alex and I'm excited

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,090
to be up here with the three of you um

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,530
hi my name is Tara Carver I'm the

18
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,379
executive director of the Humboldt

19
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,629
County Growers Alliance we represent 250

20
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:54,988
plant touching members the vast majority

21
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:56,939
of them are cultivators or farmers but

22
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:59,788
we also have manufacturers retailers

23
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:03,209
distributors testing labs in our ranks

24
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,969
as well I come from the industry I'm a

25
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,290
cannabis farmer by trade became a policy

26
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:10,319
wonk by necessity

27
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,659
legalization kind of blew through

28
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:15,449
Humboldt and we all had to really step

29
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,009
up but when we think about communication

30
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,250
we didn't think about communication

31
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,618
honestly like I I was brought up in an

32
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,469
era of the less communication the better

33
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:27,859
because you stayed safe and so we've

34
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:29,548
swung the pendulum on this whole

35
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:31,409
legalization thing and having to

36
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,170
actually talk about what we do and what

37
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,930
regulation does and how it impacts us

38
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,759
and so I I probably have the least

39
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,890
amount of experience in communication

40
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,438
but I've found that if you have fun with

41
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,879
it it actually works and so far we've

42
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,989
been pretty successful in Humboldt so

43
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:50,219
I'm here to say thank you thanks Sarah

44
00:01:47,989 --> 00:01:52,169
Jared Kyle oh and the president of the

45
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,629
United canvass Business Association we

46
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,670
are a trade organization comprised

47
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:59,519
mostly of retailers but you know like a

48
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,439
lot of retailers there are quite a lot

49
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,118
of other points inside the supply chain

50
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:06,508
that they take on but we definitely

51
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:08,939
prioritize and wear the hat of retailers

52
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,250
most of the work that I've done when I

53
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:13,469
started here in San Francisco about 18

54
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,539
years ago so it's nice to still

55
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:17,580
in my hometown and still doing this but

56
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:20,159
I I do operate in Los Angeles quite a

57
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,710
bit which I enjoy but I definitely enjoy

58
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,629
coming home and also being a part of

59
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,730
this industry you know Communications

60
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:29,099
has been the biggest part of a retailer

61
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:31,500
because we had a Green Cross on us tree

62
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:33,599
for quite a few years you don't get the

63
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,189
opportunity to hide I mean I sat on the

64
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,590
medical marijuana task force here under

65
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:39,120
Gavin Newsom years ago it was awesome to

66
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,400
have someone who believed in us enough

67
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,680
to give us a space inside of City Hall

68
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,599
to actually have communication have

69
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,069
public hearings and really try to go

70
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,479
through really good standard operating

71
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:50,639
procedures and give best business

72
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,859
practices so that was a way that we got

73
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,809
to communicate to our you know to our

74
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,460
regulators and we got to tell them what

75
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,599
was needed and what the best business

76
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,090
practices were gonna be and having

77
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,489
subcommittees that communication has

78
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:05,580
been you know pivotal in being able to

79
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:07,890
run a trade organization because now I

80
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,380
had the foundation of how you can

81
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:12,569
communicate with a with a kind of a

82
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:15,299
legislator that really wants to listen

83
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:16,829
and it seems like ever since then we've

84
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,290
kind of been pushing an agenda to try to

85
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,180
make sure people listen and this is now

86
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:23,429
an opportunity where everyone is here

87
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,439
trying to find out what the stakeholders

88
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,239
and legacy operators have done over

89
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,489
years and how do we protect that legacy

90
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,709
so I just appreciate the opportunity to

91
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:32,969
continue to communicate to people and

92
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:34,050
trying to get our message across so

93
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:39,509
thank you for the opportunity of this

94
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:40,980
panel hi I'm Rebecca 4a I'm the

95
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:42,509
communications manager for the

96
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:45,449
California Department of Food and

97
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:51,030
Agriculture z-- Cal cannabis cultivation

98
00:03:45,449 --> 00:04:05,219
licensing division it's quite a business

99
00:03:51,030 --> 00:04:06,389
card and the cannabis farmers that's our

100
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:08,400
job

101
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:10,469
we are here to help them get through the

102
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,900
licensing process we know it's not easy

103
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:15,569
as Laurie mentioned earlier it's a

104
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,850
process for constantly reviewing and

105
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:20,599
trying to improve and the stakeholder

106
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:22,710
feedback we get is so helpful to that

107
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,770
this morning I just thought I would

108
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:29,250
share that we have licensed 5214

109
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:32,490
cannabis cultivators in the state and we

110
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:35,850
are down to about 600 pending

111
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:38,430
applications so we we've made a lot of

112
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,470
progress before I came to Cal cannabis I

113
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,959
worked in the Senate as their

114
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,690
communications director in public policy

115
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,359
on many areas including agriculture and

116
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:49,310
I've worked at the Sierra Club and

117
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,410
communications director of companies

118
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,519
divisions of amazon.com and book

119
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,950
publishing so I have a long

120
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,469
communications background but this has

121
00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:01,288
been one of the most exciting constantly

122
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:03,539
changing communications positions I

123
00:05:01,288 --> 00:05:05,579
think that Alex and I have probably been

124
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:07,409
in because it's just that the ground is

125
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:10,109
always moving and the laws are changing

126
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:14,120
and we're trying to keep up just as much

127
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:16,650
as as everybody else is so thank you

128
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,189
good morning everybody my name is Ruben

129
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:22,409
Hoenig I am a co-founder of Cirrus

130
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:25,110
strategies it's a consulting firm that

131
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,419
has been around since 2016 I have been

132
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,910
in the industry for five years

133
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:32,549
originally moving I'm from Massachusetts

134
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,770
originally but moving from Florida

135
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,620
five six years ago is actually five

136
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:40,189
years of this past December for actually

137
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,389
safe access as a medical patient so

138
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:46,860
originally got into the industry you

139
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:49,019
know with extreme concerns that people

140
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,180
weren't getting in other states or

141
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:53,310
California you know moving as I moved to

142
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:57,090
California where they have had a very

143
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:58,530
long-standing medical program I kind of

144
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:00,509
stepped into that but then looking at

145
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:02,069
other states seeing that you know there

146
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:06,538
wasn't that that kind of access and

147
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:08,339
people you know really needing to figure

148
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:09,659
that out you know and I remember you

149
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:13,589
know going to dispensaries when I just

150
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,880
showed up in in Los Angeles and I know

151
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:16,139
Jarrod spoke about this about

152
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,519
dispensaries you know kind of being the

153
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:19,168
frontline and communicating with

154
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,538
patients but I was interesting and I

155
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:22,918
would start started to see you know how

156
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:24,389
but tenders how people were actually

157
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:25,829
communicating with people you know it

158
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:27,360
was wild the people I would see would

159
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:30,209
come into a dispensary and say this was

160
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,100
my my wife had stage four cancer this is

161
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:32,370
our last opportunity this is the last

162
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,490
thing

163
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,530
you know that we can do and what do you

164
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,449
do and what do we do and then there was

165
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:41,519
kind of this you know depending on who

166
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:43,319
you speak to depending on who you do who

167
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:44,279
you who you're getting advice from it

168
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,699
was kind of you know it wasn't

169
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:51,259
standardized right um I do more work on

170
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:53,340
local licensing policy work at the state

171
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:56,360
locally in the city of Los Angeles um

172
00:06:53,339 --> 00:07:00,149
I'm based in LA I've done a lot of trade

173
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:02,639
associated associated is key

174
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:04,620
communicating with policymakers

175
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,788
communicating internally with membership

176
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:11,310
and you know I appreciate this

177
00:07:08,788 --> 00:07:15,990
conference and our moderator Alex

178
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:19,379
traverse' so so I was given the sort of

179
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:20,759
the the leeway to select what the panel

180
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:22,889
was gonna be who was gonna be on this

181
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,860
panel and so obviously I picked the

182
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:27,360
people that I am a fan of their work and

183
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:30,720
so and I think that they all represent

184
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,310
sort of an interesting and they all come

185
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,289
from interesting backgrounds and they

186
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,810
all have to communicate with with

187
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:39,620
different audiences and so as I think a

188
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:44,310
lot of us know the way you reach a

189
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:45,598
grower versus a retailer versus you know

190
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,399
just a general stakeholder there's

191
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:51,329
there's many different tactics many

192
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:53,219
different ways of communication and so

193
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:55,379
I'm really interested in just kind of

194
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,270
hearing some of the different challenges

195
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:59,550
that we all sort of face in our

196
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:01,799
day-to-day lives and trying to

197
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,960
communicate with folks so I mean I think

198
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,639
you know as much as I want this to be

199
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:07,198
sort of freewheeling and everyone jump

200
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,210
in where they can I think I think I want

201
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,220
to start with with Jared on this one

202
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:13,138
just because he's not only a business

203
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,460
owner but he does represent a trade

204
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,900
association and I think there are

205
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:19,109
different challenges that come with that

206
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:21,810
so and I'll let you take the take it

207
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:23,580
away well I mean when we're trying to

208
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:26,310
deal with a market that is now

209
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:28,319
transitioning you went from absolutely

210
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,360
no regulations and in the attempt to

211
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,490
hide and now when you transition to

212
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,250
probably the most regulated product that

213
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:38,219
we can think of now in California trying

214
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:40,320
to get those people to transition has

215
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,940
been one of the most parts because

216
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,680
they're trying to keep their business

217
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,720
going they're trying to understand OSHA

218
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,149
certifications they're trying to make

219
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,070
sure that

220
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:50,500
they did the sexual harassment you know

221
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,270
like studies I mean like we've got all

222
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,879
of these things to think about and then

223
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:56,799
I come in as a as the president of this

224
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,289
organization talking about regulations

225
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:00,669
possible labor unions what labor peace

226
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:03,039
agreements are there and it is

227
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:04,929
overwhelming for most to even try to

228
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,990
hear all the things that we have to

229
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:09,719
trans transition to them and so when you

230
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:12,490
try to give them a safe place to say

231
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,320
okay how can i boil this down to what

232
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,539
your biggest needs are and how do you

233
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,640
create priorities now our organization

234
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:20,379
has done a good job of keeping three or

235
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,360
four priorities at the top of our list

236
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:24,279
saying we have to deal with these first

237
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,110
before we move on and that's been a

238
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:28,329
great way of communicating to people who

239
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:30,190
feel like they're frazzled by all the

240
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,750
information they need to absorb and then

241
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,330
they start to look at how much they're

242
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:37,120
spending on legal legal counsel and on

243
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,860
consulting fees and so trying to be a

244
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,929
trade organization that funnels all that

245
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,240
information lowers those costs and

246
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:45,339
reduces those barriers because I'm

247
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,980
sitting in a seat that says I have the

248
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:50,230
exact same issues you do as a retailer I

249
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,420
also have to survive and here's the

250
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,100
things I'm doing as a retailer and when

251
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:56,979
you sit in a room of everyone having the

252
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:59,500
same needs a lot of conversations from

253
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,149
that is what really builds up kind of

254
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,980
kind of a community and that's what I

255
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:05,259
really wanted in Los Angeles now being

256
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,420
in Northern California community was

257
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:09,519
just was just how you lived I mean you

258
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:11,169
didn't you didn't have people come and

259
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,309
trim at your grow-op unless you knew

260
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:15,939
them or they were a friend of a friend

261
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:17,889
and so trying to establish that Northern

262
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,510
California style of community in

263
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:21,460
Southern California was a little

264
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:23,319
difficult everyone's like what are you

265
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,509
doing here like why are you in Los

266
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,140
Angeles I'm sorry but we usually fight

267
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:28,059
with each other

268
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:29,620
how are we gonna love each other and I

269
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:32,769
realize that that may sound a little bit

270
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:35,110
soft and like you know but the point is

271
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:37,210
we all want to feel comfort with each

272
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,680
other and so being in a group and

273
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:41,440
allowing each other to express each

274
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:44,109
other's needs and then offering possible

275
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,150
solutions has been what this group is

276
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,159
why we've stayed together I mean we

277
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:49,419
spent millions of dollars passing an

278
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,850
ordinance in the city of Los Angeles

279
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:53,559
measure em and like as a trade

280
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,090
organization trying to get people to

281
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:56,949
pull millions of dollars out of their

282
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:59,649
pockets telling them that this is the

283
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:02,139
pathway to their future success is

284
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:03,639
not an easy conversation explaining how

285
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:05,860
to get a hundred nine thousand

286
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:07,990
signatures to qualify an ordinance in

287
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,360
the city of La is not something that

288
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:12,278
most people understand and so that's

289
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,730
been the hardest part about running an

290
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:19,058
organization of of transitional business

291
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:21,610
owners was how do I prioritize what is

292
00:11:19,058 --> 00:11:23,558
most important to them how do i allocate

293
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:26,259
their resources and funds to the most

294
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:27,698
important parts and really transition

295
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:30,039
them into a space where they feel

296
00:11:27,698 --> 00:11:32,740
comfortable and putting that kind of you

297
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:34,778
know publicity out most of my members

298
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,178
wanted to hide for the first five and

299
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:38,828
six years of being in this organization

300
00:11:37,178 --> 00:11:41,139
and how do you get them to come out of

301
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:42,248
the shadows and really stand up for

302
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:44,049
their business stand up for their

303
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:46,058
industry and also stand up for their

304
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:48,039
community that we built and now that we

305
00:11:46,058 --> 00:11:48,999
have this nice community we feel there's

306
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:51,818
a sense of comfort

307
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:53,860
once that comforts there now we try to

308
00:11:51,818 --> 00:11:55,838
go okay here's the hard questions we

309
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,519
have to answer again today like what

310
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,050
labor unions do you really want to work

311
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,808
with which ones do you think you're

312
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:03,008
gonna represent your needs the best and

313
00:12:00,808 --> 00:12:05,078
you know it's not easy to talk about

314
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:06,909
politics in front of a group of people

315
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:09,068
who have never voted and that's that's

316
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:11,350
sometimes a problem too because we

317
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:14,198
stayed out of the limelight for so many

318
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:17,110
years then to expects to expect all of

319
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:19,659
these people to engage fully it's been a

320
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:21,459
really difficult process but you know I

321
00:12:19,659 --> 00:12:23,740
think we're in a place now where people

322
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:25,599
are proud of the work they do they're

323
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,579
proud to like tell their parents and

324
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,110
everyone that they own a dispensary we

325
00:12:27,578 --> 00:12:30,549
don't have to hide anymore remember when

326
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,499
people used to ask me what I did I used

327
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:35,078
to tell them everything else but

328
00:12:32,499 --> 00:12:36,220
cannabis and now it's like the first

329
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:38,229
thing I say when some people say what do

330
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,120
you do is like I'm proud of the cannabis

331
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,249
work I do I'm proud to be in this

332
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,649
industry and I think what happened now

333
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:47,769
is that communication of pride is what's

334
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:50,078
really pushing a lot of my members to be

335
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:51,159
out there to go hit the streets and make

336
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:53,349
sure their neighborhood councils

337
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:55,838
understand the good work they do that is

338
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:58,298
truly what did this pride an ownership

339
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,709
of a legal industry and feeling like you

340
00:12:58,298 --> 00:13:01,119
don't have to look over your shoulders

341
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:03,998
wondering when the police are gonna come

342
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:06,249
back that has changed the view of a lot

343
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:09,459
of people inside inside the retail space

344
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:11,259
we we've been the front lines for a lot

345
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:13,489
because you know in Humboldt it was

346
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:16,120
helicopters in Los Angeles

347
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:18,379
it was anytime a police officer drove by

348
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,839
everyone clenched up because you never

349
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:22,549
knew if you were gonna be subjective to

350
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:24,709
them coming into your shop whether you

351
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:27,109
thought you were legal or not prop D in

352
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:28,689
Los Angeles was a mess and left everyone

353
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:31,759
in this gray area for such a long time

354
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:33,620
so now to feel like we're supported by

355
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,629
our city to feel like we're supported by

356
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,789
our state and also to see the country

357
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:39,439
move that communication has become so

358
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:41,360
much easier because I don't have to

359
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,279
convince people that we have something

360
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,778
good to build from it's being built

361
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:46,939
right now and these regulations have

362
00:13:44,778 --> 00:13:48,500
really helped so that's probably the

363
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,360
best thing I can say about like the

364
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,028
communications now right now so I have

365
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,980
so I have a question specific to two

366
00:13:53,028 --> 00:13:56,389
growers that I want to ask but I took

367
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,950
cold medicine before I came here and I

368
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:59,509
have a question that I want to ask Ruben

369
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,670
that I'm gonna forget if I don't ask him

370
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:04,220
really quickly here so the question is

371
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:05,629
really more about if you're if you have

372
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,420
clients that you're representing

373
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:09,528
sometimes I think based on the state of

374
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:11,360
the industry and where we're at right

375
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:12,830
now that the things that things are a

376
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,110
little difficult communication can

377
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:17,300
sometimes be a nice-to-have so I'm

378
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:18,740
wondering if you what do you tell a

379
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:21,229
client who maybe doesn't have the

380
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,089
resources to bring on communication

381
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:25,579
strategy or a communicator and how do

382
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:28,220
you how do you advise them to sort of do

383
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:29,359
that work on their own did you take

384
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,600
dayquil or nyquil

385
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:40,610
I believe it's daytime so I took they're

386
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:41,300
very good it's it is it's very

387
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,950
complicated

388
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:46,750
I mean I don't know any other way to say

389
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:50,690
that we're dealing with a unprecedented

390
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:54,259
landscape where well when it comes on to

391
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:59,270
the communications side I don't

392
00:14:54,259 --> 00:15:02,059
necessarily see the value right now for

393
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:04,100
for businesses on the business side

394
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:07,009
there are so many things that businesses

395
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:10,159
you know as we're seeing the industry is

396
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:11,720
kind of contracted we're seeing a lot of

397
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:15,199
layoffs in the industry we're seeing a

398
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,639
lot of a lot of issues going on now and

399
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,950
we're seeing a lot of successes at the

400
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,528
same time I think it's it's easy to to

401
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:23,270
lament and really pile on right and and

402
00:15:21,528 --> 00:15:24,740
say oh everything is horrible it's a

403
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:26,629
crisis it's the worst we're all gonna

404
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,100
die and everything is you know what

405
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:30,439
you know going going out there and

406
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,610
talking to people um there's a lot of

407
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,120
stories out there there's a lot of

408
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:36,500
people you know that aren't putting out

409
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,970
press releases when they raise a bunch

410
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,309
of money right they're not putting

411
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,629
saying oh I have $100,000,000 oh I have

412
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:43,489
two hundred million dollars you know

413
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:45,289
they're there quietly you know building

414
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:47,019
their businesses one two three steps at

415
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:50,569
a time and not you know necessarily

416
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:53,049
getting ahead of things you know

417
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:57,200
communicating with local governments

418
00:15:53,049 --> 00:16:00,229
complicated again you know as we

419
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:03,710
probably all know here there are there

420
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:06,350
are there is a is a shortage of license

421
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:07,879
dispensaries across the state there are

422
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:10,300
areas that don't have them you know we

423
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:15,049
do see a lot of dispensaries in

424
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:17,629
municipal bigger - municipal areas but

425
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:19,279
also you know on the other side of that

426
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:21,769
coin we're seeing that that those stores

427
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:26,059
you know depending on levels of

428
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:27,769
enforcement and levels of Taxation and

429
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:31,689
different inputs we're seeing you know

430
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:36,699
stores barely touch the the the outer

431
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:40,450
realm of their ability of their capacity

432
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:43,040
it's it's unfortunate to see people not

433
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:45,259
wanting to go to stores I think Los

434
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,959
Angeles has a great opportunity to

435
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:49,580
communicate with the public through

436
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,430
public education we have seen we'd wise

437
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,570
at the state the city of Los Angeles

438
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:55,069
still has seven hundred fifty thousand

439
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:58,730
dollars sitting inside of some sort of

440
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:02,510
thank you for that campaign plug every

441
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:06,439
day you know they're you know when are

442
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:08,568
we going to communicate more and more

443
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,610
effectively with the consumer with the

444
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:12,199
public eye you know maybe I'm on my own

445
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:13,849
Island over all the way over here but I

446
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,740
think that there's a large majority of

447
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:18,469
people that think since prop 64 passed

448
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:20,390
everything is legal right and I think

449
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,039
and I think that segues into the

450
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:24,199
question for how to communicate with

451
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:26,420
with growers - and I want to get terra's

452
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:27,890
thought on that and then I want to talk

453
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,960
to Rebecca a little bit that about that

454
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:32,930
as well because Cal cannabis has its own

455
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,870
PR campaign that is focused on on

456
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:37,460
reaching cultivators and it's it's not

457
00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:39,199
as easy as potentially the one that

458
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,640
we're talking about with weed wise and

459
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,900
and reaching you know

460
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,310
retailers because there's so much more

461
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,730
out in the forefront of things so

462
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:48,710
speaking to growers I think the Humboldt

463
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:51,079
County growers Alliance does a great job

464
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:53,779
and their communications member

465
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:59,029
appreciation posts are always fun so you

466
00:17:53,779 --> 00:18:02,210
know so Humboldt County is has a long

467
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:04,759
history sixty plus years of rebel

468
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:08,329
outrageous outlaw cannabis farmers and

469
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:10,849
we're very prideful of our work but

470
00:18:08,329 --> 00:18:13,460
being a rebel outrageous loud cannabis

471
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:14,779
farmer now I have found like we've have

472
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,549
to kind of tone it back a little bit

473
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:18,379
when we're talking to the policy makers

474
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:21,289
and so my struggle sometimes with

475
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,760
communication is is taking my amazing

476
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:24,710
membership and all their outrageous

477
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:26,059
stories and asking them to be very

478
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,100
professional when you go in and talk to

479
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:30,559
you to your local government about taxes

480
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:32,179
instead of coming in with protest signs

481
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,149
and you know banging down the door and

482
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:36,680
locking yourself to to the chair it's

483
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:41,269
we've had to rearrange a bit of our

484
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:43,759
strategy but I guess when when I think

485
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:45,980
about growers and communicating with

486
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:50,000
growers from heritage regions in

487
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:52,480
California humor is the best way to get

488
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,890
across a message across in my opinion I

489
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,750
again because we can be so serious and

490
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:58,130
outrageous and loud if you can tone it

491
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:01,069
down with a little bit of humor it

492
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:04,760
really makes it the communication style

493
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:06,349
very personal and I like to kind of

494
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:08,450
think of our members there they're very

495
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:11,240
passionate they're artists and so if you

496
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:13,580
can communicate to them on a level of

497
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,950
basic humanity they respond really well

498
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:17,480
so that's that's been my mic trick and I

499
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,830
think that that that's great because

500
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,140
that's that's ordinarily what I would

501
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:22,730
shoot for as well at the bureau is sort

502
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,530
of a fun conversational style

503
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,029
unfortunately that the state kind of

504
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:27,619
frowns upon that sometimes you can't

505
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:30,470
have too much fun because that that's

506
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:32,629
it's not approved so in that and that

507
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,370
I'd like to hear Rebecca's perspective

508
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,830
because she I know she feels my pain on

509
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:39,799
a regular basis as well so getting her

510
00:19:36,829 --> 00:19:41,629
perspective on their the regulator side

511
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:43,039
of things and maybe talking a little bit

512
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:46,360
about the campaign that you guys have

513
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,359
with with food nag

514
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:52,089
can we have an industry awareness

515
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:54,820
campaign that is going to unroll very

516
00:19:52,089 --> 00:19:57,490
soon there'll be an announcement in a

517
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:59,409
few weeks where we're going to talk

518
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,779
about the merits of being a licensed

519
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:03,790
cannabis farmer in the state and talking

520
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:06,549
to other farmers who are licensed who

521
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:09,609
will share their stories up and down the

522
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:11,289
state and we are been working very hard

523
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:15,339
on that and we're looking forward to

524
00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:17,289
launching that soon I wanted to add that

525
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:19,539
and Alex and I are always on the front

526
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:21,490
lines of breaking with the reporters who

527
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:23,079
do a really good job of keeping on top

528
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:26,799
of everything it's it's a it's a

529
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:29,259
demanding beat covering cannabis but as

530
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:31,029
as former journalists and reporters we

531
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:33,129
also know the importance of getting back

532
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:34,720
to people really quickly finding the

533
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:37,270
information that's needed so that

534
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,769
everybody out there can get the latest

535
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:43,329
breaking news we've also had surveys at

536
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:45,519
the department food and AG asking

537
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:47,710
farmers how do you want to get your

538
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:50,440
information what's the best way to get

539
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:54,789
it to you and social media has been very

540
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:57,549
popular we have now at food and AG we

541
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:58,990
have an Instagram channel which food and

542
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:01,690
Agri celebrated its 100th anniversary

543
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:04,569
last year they never had an Instagram

544
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:06,400
channel but the cannabis farmers said

545
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:09,099
they love to look at the beautiful

546
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:13,030
photographs of their their plants and so

547
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:14,769
we added Instagram to that collection of

548
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:17,200
social media channels and then we also

549
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:20,529
recently added a twitter espanol channel

550
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,150
and we have bilingual person on staff to

551
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,279
reach out to some of the spanish farmers

552
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:27,400
and we've been doing more with mom

553
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:29,170
farmers as well and again that's from

554
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,910
the stakeholder feedback that we've been

555
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:34,390
getting so we really do listen to the

556
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:36,460
feedback that we get from you there's a

557
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:41,140
lot of material we put out for people to

558
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:43,390
read fa Q's fact sheets and but not

559
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,460
everybody is a reader so we're also

560
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:50,800
doing more short videos we're doing

561
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:54,430
podcasts we're doing more photo essays

562
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:56,440
and things like that so we do listen to

563
00:21:54,430 --> 00:22:00,190
how people want their information

564
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:03,759
and we do radio talk shows we do news

565
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:06,940
shows on television and we just try all

566
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:10,779
avenues to get out there and get the

567
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:14,529
message so this so and speaking about

568
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:17,139
sort of feedback and in your in your

569
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:18,849
communications and maybe some some

570
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,460
things that you know I would like to

571
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:24,099
mention in our in our in our realm at

572
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,450
the BCC so we started out and this is

573
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:26,289
I've been at this for a little over

574
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,900
three years now

575
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:30,549
and so we set up our social media

576
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,290
channels and I think initially when we

577
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,940
started out I think there was sort of a

578
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:36,099
the general feeling was we're gonna

579
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,960
we're getting the benefit of the doubt

580
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:39,909
alright let's wait and see how this how

581
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,170
this thing rolls out and over the course

582
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,900
of three years I think the tide is

583
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:46,150
turned a little bit on us and so so so

584
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,740
in terms of speaking about challenges

585
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:50,110
and some of the feedback you receive in

586
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:51,490
your communications I think one thing

587
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:53,049
that stuck out to me the other day and I

588
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:54,490
read everything so I see I see

589
00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:56,349
everything that people comment on our

590
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,210
posts and things we put out there and

591
00:22:56,349 --> 00:23:00,009
somebody just said you know you've got

592
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,539
to hand it to the BCC they continue to

593
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:02,920
put this [ __ ] out even though they're

594
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:04,180
everyone's killing them right like

595
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,710
they're just we're getting lit up on a

596
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,029
regular basis everything we put out

597
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:09,100
there you're terrible people all this

598
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:10,629
stuff those are those are the challenges

599
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:11,859
we deal with on a regular basis because

600
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:14,050
you have to continue to put information

601
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:15,609
out there you can't just go dark because

602
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:17,710
you're getting this negative feedback so

603
00:23:15,609 --> 00:23:19,119
I'd like to just sort of run down the

604
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,500
panel and talk about some of the

605
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:21,849
feedback you've received some of the

606
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,799
feedback good or bad that you've

607
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:27,609
received in your communications programs

608
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:29,250
and maybe some some of the challenges

609
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:33,159
that you just based on a regular basis

610
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:34,720
sure so I think I'm just gonna say it we

611
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,310
can all agree that the input of

612
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,259
information that we have to turn around

613
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:40,659
and turn out is a lot and so whether

614
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:43,390
it's the BCC Cal Canibus other trade

615
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:46,769
associations news articles it is a

616
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:49,000
constant move for us we're a scrappy

617
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:51,099
grassroots organization like we don't

618
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,369
have a hundred billion dollar million

619
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:56,709
trillion zero budget like there's three

620
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:58,779
of us and one of our biggest challenges

621
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:02,049
has actually come down to finding a

622
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:04,809
graphic designer who will who's not in

623
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:06,730
house and so meaning that we can't get a

624
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:09,339
graphic designer to be able to be on

625
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:10,210
call and we've been doing this for three

626
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:12,669
three and a half year

627
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:14,890
and we started local and then the

628
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:17,140
outsource to San Francisco and then we

629
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:19,420
outsource to New York we literally have

630
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,400
a gentleman in Serbia right now turning

631
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:24,300
over our graphic design work because I

632
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,990
can't find one in the United States

633
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:28,480
we'll talk later

634
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:31,059
I've got some things to say on this

635
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,620
issue that I have this is great we're

636
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:35,589
making connections right now I like this

637
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:39,129
I mean Alexia's gonna be really bummed

638
00:24:35,589 --> 00:24:41,079
he's great and but nonetheless so

639
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:42,970
turning over that information and so if

640
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:44,230
I if I can't get the Instagram post

641
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,759
because that's how our rural farmers

642
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:47,500
communicate and thank you so much for

643
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:49,990
hearing us on that it's been such such a

644
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,329
big deal for us if I can't get that

645
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:54,549
Instagram post out with within 48 hours

646
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:57,369
sometimes the policy will change and now

647
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:58,990
I've paid for it it's not relevant

648
00:24:57,369 --> 00:25:02,049
anymore and I have to go pay for it

649
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:03,940
again and then I've had issues that have

650
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:07,139
changed so rapidly that I've had three

651
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:10,870
posts that are that are all worthless so

652
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:13,210
that's that's our biggest issue yeah I

653
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:15,069
think it was interesting because we

654
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:17,470
stood out really quickly in Los Angeles

655
00:25:15,069 --> 00:25:19,960
and trying to make regulations like

656
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:22,120
legal dealing with that gray area for

657
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,620
such a few years quite a few years we

658
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:26,289
kind of went like okay we're gonna jump

659
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:28,539
out and make this happen so we wrote an

660
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:30,279
ordinance and immediately as soon as we

661
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:32,589
wrote an ordinance we were the target of

662
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:34,509
just about everyone we were called

663
00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:35,829
monopolistic we were called deeply

664
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:37,990
entrenched and trying to make sure that

665
00:25:35,829 --> 00:25:39,549
no one else could enter the market what

666
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:41,500
happens is when you stick your neck out

667
00:25:39,549 --> 00:25:43,089
everyone loves to point a finger that

668
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,950
you're the bad guy you're the bad girl

669
00:25:43,089 --> 00:25:46,359
you're the one who's come out here and

670
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:48,819
trying to take over the industry with

671
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:50,949
your words and your ballot measures and

672
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:53,439
so that was initially how we got started

673
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:55,600
the first thing was like wow here's a 53

674
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,890
page ballot initiative in the city of

675
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:58,569
Los Angeles and we're being called

676
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:00,370
monopolistic we're like we're just

677
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:02,639
trying to make sure that the legal part

678
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:05,500
of this industry continues to grow and

679
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,930
even to the even to today even when we

680
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,670
have you know a retail expansion bill

681
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:11,650
that we've been we've been trying to run

682
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:13,330
this whole you know this year we're

683
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:15,310
still being called monopolistic as an

684
00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:18,669
organization because because we

685
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:20,740
represent a small section of license

686
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:22,300
holders inside the retail segment and

687
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,130
the thought is is that we're in

688
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:26,740
trying to grow this industry because we

689
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:28,390
want it all for ourselves which is it's

690
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,370
a difficult part to have to try to

691
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:31,960
communicate to people like it's hard to

692
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:34,239
be monopolistic when you have a

693
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,769
dispensary in Los Angeles am i really

694
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,950
taking over the Northern California

695
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:41,349
market with my dispensary in LA and it's

696
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:43,809
like I think the communication is like I

697
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:45,909
really only have reach about five or six

698
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:48,369
miles from the center of my dispensary

699
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:50,380
so how can I be monopolistic and I think

700
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:52,869
the thing is with with this kind of

701
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:55,060
communication style people love to break

702
00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:57,189
you down and say that you're bad so they

703
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:59,109
can elevate themselves and trying to

704
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:01,870
kind of elevate yourself above that

705
00:26:59,109 --> 00:27:04,389
chatter because in the positions we're

706
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:06,279
in elevating yourself over people who

707
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,660
are trying to just hate on the work that

708
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:10,119
you're doing

709
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,650
you can't just dive into that every time

710
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:13,629
and lose sleep or the fact that people

711
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:15,850
don't like you you have to stay focused

712
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:17,590
you have to keep your group focused and

713
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:19,659
whenever someone says something negative

714
00:27:17,589 --> 00:27:21,399
about you you need to take it in and see

715
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:23,230
if that's true and if it doesn't feel

716
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,610
true to you you have to shed it off and

717
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,950
not feel like you have to continue to

718
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:29,139
answer that same negative feedback so

719
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:32,200
that's been the biggest like challenge

720
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:33,880
for us especially in Los Angeles is to

721
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,799
really take that negative feedback and

722
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:41,740
push it out and really just try to be

723
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:43,419
productive Tara I wanted to let you know

724
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,150
that we have a lot of free graphic

725
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:47,320
artists responding on our Instagram page

726
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:51,519
they're getting very creative with

727
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:54,069
emojis and they communicate very well

728
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:58,150
what they're not happy about with with

729
00:27:54,069 --> 00:28:00,909
sometimes r-rated emojis and a lot of

730
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:02,800
fun looking at those but we we want to

731
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:05,170
hear the good and the bad we want to get

732
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,779
all the feedback because we do go back

733
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:09,370
and figure out okay a lot of you aren't

734
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:12,190
liking this how can we make it better

735
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:14,529
how can we change it and the change

736
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:16,240
takes a while sometimes but we are we

737
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:18,129
are listening and we always welcome the

738
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,730
feedback whether it's on social media or

739
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:26,440
calling food nag we have a toll-free 183

740
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:28,210
3 Cal grow phone number we we do invite

742
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:32,019
stakeholders and I just want to throw

743
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:33,759
also some people just like to have

744
00:28:32,019 --> 00:28:35,650
one-on-one conversations with the

745
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:38,589
experts and licensing

746
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:40,540
and thanks to my partners at Fish and

747
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:44,399
Wildlife who were here today and the

748
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:47,859
water board's we are doing about a dozen

749
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:50,320
free cultivation licensing workshops

750
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:52,479
across the state just for the first half

751
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:54,609
of the year we will have more

752
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,200
we've tried doing online workshops we

753
00:28:54,609 --> 00:29:00,939
did one we're gonna do another one on

754
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:03,250
February 21st and that allows people in

755
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:05,170
remote areas to also look at maybe they

756
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:07,059
can't make it to LA or San Francisco or

757
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:09,610
or some parts of Humboldt

758
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:11,710
wherever we might be so we're trying

759
00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:14,229
this and it was very effective the first

760
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:16,180
time so we're doing it again and all of

761
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:19,269
this is posted on our social media and

762
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:23,080
it's on our online calendars so you can

763
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:25,150
plan accordingly but we do welcome the

764
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:30,189
feedback you know good and bad so thank

765
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:33,730
you for everybody's comments left me at

766
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:35,799
the end didn't you all right so I think

767
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:39,490
that one thing I wanted to bring up is

768
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:41,680
and this actually was interesting you

769
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:43,210
know in in another trade association the

770
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,930
LA cannabis taskforce that I helped

771
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:48,519
found and you know really kind of got to

772
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,930
know the ins and outs of cannabis got to

773
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:54,579
know the ins and outs of LA local

774
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:57,549
policies some state policy but what I

775
00:29:54,579 --> 00:29:59,859
learned you know many years ago which is

776
00:29:57,549 --> 00:30:05,259
in cannabis years not in human years but

777
00:29:59,859 --> 00:30:06,369
they it you need to communicate with the

778
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:07,450
state you know the way that you

779
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:08,709
communicate what the state is different

780
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:10,000
than the way you communicate with the

781
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:11,230
city of Los Angeles is different than

782
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,940
you communicate with the city of San

783
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:15,339
Diego they need to communicate with San

784
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:17,920
Jose you know you know we got into a

785
00:30:15,339 --> 00:30:19,449
position where you know we we placed an

786
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,769
article or had some quotes that were you

787
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,809
know a little bit inflammatory in the

788
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:24,069
city of Los Angeles and you know when

789
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:25,809
you do stuff like that then the

790
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:26,710
councilmember just cuts you off we're

791
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:29,919
not talking to you anymore

792
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:31,390
and that's it at the state you know you

793
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,769
know we were with my former business

794
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,630
partner she came from the state and she

795
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:35,980
was you know more aggressive with with

796
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:37,600
kind of her positioning and it was

797
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:40,000
almost like oh come on these people are

798
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:41,709
being babies but at the same time you

799
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,079
know the you have to be very conscious

800
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:45,819
of your audience and you have to you it

801
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:48,199
is very very easy to make a

802
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:50,480
communication snafu

803
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,600
and you know people are sensitive people

804
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,990
are emotional you know the cannabis

805
00:30:53,599 --> 00:31:00,379
industry I think it's it's tough right

806
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:02,690
now because when you're in it every

807
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:06,049
single day and you're working in the

808
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:11,298
industry be it you know ancillary

809
00:31:06,048 --> 00:31:13,879
licensees it's just it's hard to to kind

810
00:31:11,298 --> 00:31:16,970
of take a step back in NC perspective of

811
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,070
you know well if I care so much about

812
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:22,069
this to the people to stay care as much

813
00:31:19,069 --> 00:31:23,808
as I do and I think to your to your

814
00:31:22,069 --> 00:31:26,119
point I think all of us on a regular

815
00:31:23,808 --> 00:31:28,038
basis are so sort of entrenched in what

816
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:29,479
we're doing that sometimes there may be

817
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:31,638
are there opportunities out there for

818
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,259
different different tactics or different

819
00:31:31,638 --> 00:31:37,609
ways of doing things that we may not be

820
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:40,190
able to capitalize on utilize whatever

821
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:42,109
it is and case in point a couple weeks

822
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,669
ago we're at a different event and there

823
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:45,229
was a regulator from Oregon there and

824
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:49,820
they were talking about their they have

825
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:51,860
a podcast and and so my my boss

826
00:31:49,819 --> 00:31:53,418
afterward comes to me and says what do

827
00:31:51,859 --> 00:31:55,069
you think should we do what we had a

828
00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:56,750
California podcast and I was like are

829
00:31:55,069 --> 00:31:58,730
you are you serious when that thing goes

830
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,380
through the editing and the review

831
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,659
process it'd be like a valium at the end

832
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:04,220
of the day right it put people to sleep

833
00:32:01,659 --> 00:32:06,200
so so maybe but these are things that

834
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,159
you think about as possibilities right

835
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,889
these are some of these are things that

836
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:11,269
are out there so this will be the next

837
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:12,648
couple questions are just gonna sort of

838
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:15,349
serve as the lightening round here

839
00:32:12,648 --> 00:32:17,388
before we before we wrap up so in terms

840
00:32:15,349 --> 00:32:19,278
of opportunities are there opportunities

841
00:32:17,388 --> 00:32:21,908
that that you would like to explore and

842
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:24,380
what might they be going forward

843
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:29,059
sumo-wrestling at the state capitol for

844
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:30,710
stakeholders on issues I think it's a

845
00:32:29,058 --> 00:32:33,470
great idea we can fundraise off of it

846
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:36,649
and donate to charities the this

847
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:39,798
industry is extremely emotional reactive

848
00:32:36,648 --> 00:32:42,768
and hyper engaged which is good it's not

849
00:32:39,798 --> 00:32:44,599
a bad thing so as far as state

850
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:47,509
regulators yeah I think you should host

851
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:52,548
those those sumo wrestling matches done

852
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:54,379
cool I think it's tough to have

853
00:32:52,548 --> 00:32:56,269
everyone's voice be heard it would be

854
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,370
really nice if we could kind of do some

855
00:32:56,269 --> 00:33:00,829
more like video conference calls so that

856
00:32:58,369 --> 00:33:01,709
the BCC and people can ask questions

857
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:04,199
directly

858
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:06,058
laterz in kind of a digital format so

859
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:09,210
that we don't have to come to you know

860
00:33:06,058 --> 00:33:11,668
drive find parking get a hotel room to

861
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:13,470
ask you know our regulator questions and

862
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:15,450
I think sometimes in the group setting

863
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:17,460
it is nice to hear other people ask

864
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:18,899
questions you probably were fearful of

865
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,730
asking because you think it's stupid but

866
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:22,558
then all of a sudden that question gets

867
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:24,480
asked so I think that kind of larger

868
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:26,609
group video conference would be really

869
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,470
nice for for people to ask questions

870
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:30,359
just calling someone on a phone you

871
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,190
don't get to see facial expressions or

872
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:33,869
or anything so you don't know how to

873
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:36,090
judge if your question is well received

874
00:33:33,869 --> 00:33:40,079
or heard so I think I think some video

875
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:41,939
stuff would be really nice for us and

876
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:43,798
we're actually going to be doing more

877
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,909
videos short videos on social media

878
00:33:43,798 --> 00:33:47,220
because we found that they're very

879
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:49,409
effective people are really busy they

880
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,970
don't have a lot of time so we really

881
00:33:49,409 --> 00:33:54,179
analyze what are the questions that are

882
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:55,740
most often asked and we can get those

883
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:57,840
out there like the top three and the

884
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:00,028
answers and if you need more information

885
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:02,519
where to go trying to make we just

886
00:34:00,028 --> 00:34:05,250
redesign our website recently trying to

887
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:06,960
make it easier to navigate where to find

888
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:09,480
what you need

889
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,119
absent making a call or sending an email

890
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,440
which of course you can also do but that

891
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:16,919
that's something that we work on very

892
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:20,000
hard at the food now I do want to vote

893
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:24,480
for sumo wrestling first though honestly

894
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,128
every issue we just throw down I heard

895
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,510
the question then Tara said sumo

896
00:34:26,128 --> 00:34:32,338
wrestling and then I lost the question I

897
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:34,919
don't think it matters anymore really

898
00:34:32,338 --> 00:34:37,289
fine it does not matter I would like to

899
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:38,878
see more collaboration that's I think I

900
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:40,289
think that you know between trade

901
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:44,539
associations between you know

902
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:48,960
stakeholders and the state you know BCC

903
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:50,039
CDFA CD pH the consolidated version of

904
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,030
whatever we're gonna see next year

905
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:56,929
potentially yes I think that who knows

906
00:34:54,030 --> 00:35:00,000
who knows work and even like like give

907
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:01,919
you know there's there's just it's it's

908
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,960
it's very complicated there's a lot of

909
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,059
regulations there's a lot of compliance

910
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,588
issues there's a big drop off right now

911
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:09,989
with metric you know people are having

912
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:11,789
you know the state is politely you know

913
00:35:09,989 --> 00:35:12,899
being a little bit lenient with it but

914
00:35:11,789 --> 00:35:15,239
at the same time

915
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:17,660
it's fair to say you know that there is

916
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:19,649
all these different things that are just

917
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:21,298
complicate just run a business so I

918
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:23,519
think that more collaboration between

919
00:35:21,298 --> 00:35:24,778
the state and stakeholders to put more

920
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:27,449
information now so people can have a

921
00:35:24,778 --> 00:35:29,068
baseline understanding of of things so

922
00:35:27,449 --> 00:35:31,439
they don't have to necessarily hire a

923
00:35:29,068 --> 00:35:33,329
high-priced or mid-priced or local price

924
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,548
consultant or they don't have to you

925
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:36,839
know you know deal with their you know

926
00:35:35,548 --> 00:35:38,429
their lawyers and I understand people

927
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:39,869
have to run their businesses too with

928
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:42,088
ancillary businesses or people that uh

929
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:43,769
you know or not licensees but you know

930
00:35:42,088 --> 00:35:45,778
there should be a you know a level of

931
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:48,298
just a baseline of this information that

932
00:35:45,778 --> 00:35:49,889
people can get and and it can actually

933
00:35:48,298 --> 00:35:51,630
you know they don't have to hire

934
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:53,699
multiple people and just this is all

935
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:55,650
good feedback thank you asking the

936
00:35:53,699 --> 00:36:00,028
critiques come in keep them coming like

937
00:35:55,650 --> 00:36:03,150
collaborate so so obviously with this

938
00:36:00,028 --> 00:36:05,039
particular panel I'm fans of all the

939
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:08,548
work of these folks on the panel but I

940
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:10,589
want to also give everyone the

941
00:36:08,548 --> 00:36:13,818
opportunity to to talk a little bit

942
00:36:10,588 --> 00:36:15,900
about like who who's who's doing a

943
00:36:13,818 --> 00:36:17,759
communications program that you actually

944
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,010
pay attention to and think is doing a

945
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,240
good job and not everyone needs to say

946
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:23,730
the Bureau of cannabis control at the

947
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:25,949
same time so it's fine but who do you

948
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:27,929
think I mean who whose communications do

949
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:29,939
you follow and say like these people are

950
00:36:27,929 --> 00:36:31,710
actually doing a great job and this is

951
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:35,608
if I was telling someone or if I was

952
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:37,048
advising someone on you know how to how

953
00:36:35,608 --> 00:36:42,900
to run an effective communications

954
00:36:37,048 --> 00:36:45,630
program who would I point them to you

955
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,250
start this time that's fine fine I have

956
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,778
actually no one to give you that's doing

957
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:51,088
it and not in a bad way but it's like

958
00:36:48,778 --> 00:36:55,380
what were I think that what we're seeing

959
00:36:51,088 --> 00:36:57,119
now is with businesses that are not

960
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,680
doing well laying off employees you know

961
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,690
they're signalling to their investors

962
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:02,608
signaling to the Canadian stock market

963
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:04,440
signaling to whoever you know they're

964
00:37:02,608 --> 00:37:08,608
there all their businesses their

965
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,900
employees that you know they you know

966
00:37:08,608 --> 00:37:12,778
they're it's nuanced and I think that

967
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,700
crisis communications actually is is a

968
00:37:12,778 --> 00:37:16,889
in you know I use that term loosely but

969
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:19,618
you know the way that you message you

970
00:37:16,889 --> 00:37:21,598
know be at ease or be it weed maps or be

971
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:23,579
it you know whatever it is or whatever a

972
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,650
company there's a you know in a nuanced

973
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:27,318
way to commute

974
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:28,970
okay and there are ways to you know to

975
00:37:27,318 --> 00:37:30,650
put the truth out there and not kind of

976
00:37:28,969 --> 00:37:33,588
skirt around it but at the same time you

977
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:37,930
know be be savvy about it so I think

978
00:37:33,588 --> 00:37:40,460
that that's you know that's that is I'm

979
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:41,629
not not to judge anything that's out

980
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,639
there right now but it's just it's it's

981
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:45,619
an important part I think of businesses

982
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:47,358
right now in this downturn to be able to

983
00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:50,869
communicate with the public

984
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:53,659
effectively and not necessarily you know

985
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:57,289
say oh we're in the gutter sorry that

986
00:37:53,659 --> 00:38:03,108
sucks you know that's Rebecca what do

987
00:37:57,289 --> 00:38:05,299
you think I look a lot at the New York

988
00:38:03,108 --> 00:38:08,719
Times I love the New York Times

989
00:38:05,298 --> 00:38:10,759
briefings this is what you need to know

990
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:13,068
right now and if you want a really deep

991
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,109
dive click here we're doing more of that

992
00:38:13,068 --> 00:38:16,818
we're giving you that bite-sized bit of

993
00:38:15,108 --> 00:38:18,920
information and then if you want to know

994
00:38:16,818 --> 00:38:20,869
all the nuts and bolts we'll have a link

995
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,430
that takes you there and we're doing

996
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:24,079
that on social media we're doing that on

997
00:38:22,429 --> 00:38:25,759
our website we're doing them with email

998
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,380
alerts we work with the bureau and

999
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,109
Department of Health and doing that as

1000
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:32,358
well but they just do such a great job

1001
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:34,338
of that and so that's something that I

1002
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:39,259
look at constantly we don't have their

1003
00:38:34,338 --> 00:38:41,210
budget but we still aim high honestly I

1004
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:43,220
think David downs and Leafly are killing

1005
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:46,608
it right now for all the investigative

1006
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:48,528
reporting agreed and so honestly I mean

1007
00:38:46,608 --> 00:38:50,598
I can't even tell you how many times I

1008
00:38:48,528 --> 00:38:53,269
quote Leafly and David Downs is like

1009
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:55,160
articles it's very helpful when I go

1010
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:56,000
into regulators we all have some of the

1011
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:58,909
same information

1012
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,409
it's a trusted source they have they

1013
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:04,159
have taken all the illegals off their

1014
00:39:00,409 --> 00:39:06,199
site March and 2018 really leading the

1015
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:07,909
kind of advertisers so I have my hat's

1016
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:10,939
off to Leafly and David downs I really

1017
00:39:07,909 --> 00:39:15,199
appreciate your work yeah I would second

1018
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:16,940
that I mean just even outside of

1019
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:18,739
cannabis like there's so much

1020
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:20,269
information being thrown up all of us

1021
00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:22,219
I'm looking out here right now and it's

1022
00:39:20,269 --> 00:39:24,199
you know each and every one of you who's

1023
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:26,149
got a cell phone you're in your your

1024
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:29,269
downloading information and the

1025
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:31,548
platforms are so vast and they it's just

1026
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:35,389
overwhelming and so credible journalism

1027
00:39:31,548 --> 00:39:38,469
is what I have found to be the savior so

1028
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:41,059
far of keeping our mental

1029
00:39:38,469 --> 00:39:43,309
okay in this space because there's so

1030
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:44,690
much misinformation so much and there's

1031
00:39:43,309 --> 00:39:46,369
so much opportunity to have

1032
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:48,590
misinformation and that can make or

1033
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:50,119
break a business a trade association or

1034
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:52,309
the reputation of a government agency

1035
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:54,950
and so credible journalism all the way

1036
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:57,079
so on that point and I want to sort of

1037
00:39:54,949 --> 00:39:58,429
maybe maybe we conclude with this but in

1038
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:01,639
terms of I mean the whole the whole

1039
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:03,529
point of this panel and discussing the

1040
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:05,150
fact that words do matter right and and

1041
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:06,380
the level of information that's coming

1042
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:10,190
out and things are changing and

1043
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:12,050
happening so quickly that there is you

1044
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:13,220
know you have to be hyper focused on on

1045
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:14,810
what you're putting out there because

1046
00:40:13,219 --> 00:40:17,959
things can mean different things to

1047
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:19,429
different people so if there anything

1048
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,320
that any of us right now would like to

1049
00:40:19,429 --> 00:40:23,599
sort of misconception that we would like

1050
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:25,369
to clear up in front of this fine cast

1051
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,420
of characters in the crowd starting with

1052
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:28,610
miss Carver

1053
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:30,590
I don't hate hemp there's a

1054
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:32,869
misconception that I hate him

1055
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:35,230
I don't not at all I didn't raise her

1056
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:37,670
taxes either been doing I didn't do that

1057
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:39,889
no you didn't and I've been trying to

1058
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:40,220
tell people that they they don't want to

1059
00:40:39,889 --> 00:40:43,789
hear it

1060
00:40:40,219 --> 00:40:46,368
they still believe I come from humble

1061
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:48,500
County we strongly believe in hemp

1062
00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:50,119
production we truly believe it can solve

1063
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,820
a lot of the world's climate crisis

1064
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:54,289
issues right now we just absolutely do

1065
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:56,359
not want it grown in Humboldt County

1066
00:40:54,289 --> 00:40:58,340
we will not cross pollinate our genetics

1067
00:40:56,358 --> 00:41:00,650
so there's a misconception that we hate

1068
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,809
I hate specifically me too I'm hearing

1069
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:05,599
it out in the ether but no I love hemp

1070
00:41:02,809 --> 00:41:07,670
just not humble well I'd love to build

1071
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:10,159
on the hemp conversation because a bee

1072
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:12,200
2:28 was something that we stopped last

1073
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:14,239
year because they would not give testing

1074
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:16,099
parity to cannabis I was not gonna allow

1075
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:18,559
a product to sit on my shelf that was

1076
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:20,118
untested like the product right next to

1077
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,219
it you know I'm trying to build for my

1078
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:25,010
for my consumers health and safety was a

1079
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:27,289
big deal and so I hope this year Aguilar

1080
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:29,210
curry takes a bee 228 and looks at it

1081
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:31,608
and do it gets parody for testing

1082
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:33,559
because I don't I would love low-cost

1083
00:41:31,608 --> 00:41:35,480
CBDs to be available to every single

1084
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:38,090
patient that wants them and needs them

1085
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,710
we need higher production of it but we

1086
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:41,480
can't let it slip into the state of

1087
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:43,369
California into the ruse that is just

1088
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,320
gonna be safe for human consumption it

1089
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:47,030
needs to be tested the same as as

1090
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,609
cannabis I think it's the right thing to

1091
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:51,620
do and I think we need it here so and I

1092
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:53,900
hope we I mean that's a misconception

1093
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:55,759
- it's like I I'm trying to keep hemp

1094
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,500
and CBDs out of the market I'm just

1095
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,240
trying to provide for my consumers in a

1096
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,590
safe and effective way and since I've

1097
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:02,839
been doing that for 18 years for

1098
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:04,760
cannabis I I would hate for someone to

1099
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,559
just slip in and in a couple of months

1100
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,510
be able to get underneath all the

1101
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:10,759
testing regulations so that's that's

1102
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:16,430
another misconception I think that I'd

1103
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:18,550
like to kind of get out there one of the

1104
00:42:16,429 --> 00:42:20,980
questions we get asked the most often is

1105
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:23,240
for those who have a provisional

1106
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:24,949
cannabis cultivation license do they

1107
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:27,529
need to get credentialed into and learn

1108
00:42:24,949 --> 00:42:30,559
how to use the California cannabis track

1109
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:31,880
and trace metric system and I think

1110
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:34,369
there was some confusion early on

1111
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:36,650
because with temporary licenses that

1112
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:39,710
wasn't the requirement but now with all

1113
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:41,570
provisional and annual licenses you do

1114
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:43,519
need to get credentialed into the metric

1115
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:46,480
system this is a program that is managed

1116
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,480
by the Department of Food and

1117
00:42:59,429 --> 00:43:02,609
[Music]

1118
00:43:02,949 --> 00:43:10,699
Agriculture comment' live on as

1119
00:43:07,579 --> 00:43:13,909
scheduled on January 2nd 2018 but I keep

1120
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:17,480
seeing 2019 I keep seeing January 2020

1121
00:43:13,909 --> 00:43:20,509
it just went live and it was January

1122
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:23,030
2018 and the team that killed themselves

1123
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:25,070
to get it live was very very proud of

1124
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:26,360
that fact but it is an area where we

1125
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:31,670
have a lot of questions so we're

1126
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:35,630
focusing on that quite a bit I think

1127
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:37,389
that misconception is that medical

1128
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:40,910
cannabis is dead

1129
00:43:37,389 --> 00:43:42,980
the there are some amazing and I'm you

1130
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:44,809
know I'm not biased but my sample is Los

1131
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,039
Angeles more I know I know lost Los

1132
00:43:44,809 --> 00:43:48,559
Angeles market more than I know the

1133
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:50,210
Northern California market but there are

1134
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:53,179
some amazing dispensaries there that are

1135
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:56,030
actually aggregating data studying

1136
00:43:53,179 --> 00:43:58,789
talking to people doing intakes and

1137
00:43:56,030 --> 00:44:00,800
actually putting their hearts and their

1138
00:43:58,789 --> 00:44:02,989
souls into helping people I know that

1139
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,700
you know it has been tough for this

1140
00:44:02,989 --> 00:44:06,679
small operator and the medicine

1141
00:44:04,699 --> 00:44:09,500
Aker to get those products into stores

1142
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:12,289
and I I urge you know us to figure out a

1143
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:14,929
way to strengthen the medical market and

1144
00:44:12,289 --> 00:44:18,679
bring it back to to true medicine and

1145
00:44:14,929 --> 00:44:20,659
you know you know we need to have a safe

1146
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:22,368
place where somebody can come to

1147
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:24,769
California and they can get make

1148
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:26,150
informed decisions about you know the

1149
00:44:24,769 --> 00:44:28,519
best they can do for their for their

1150
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:30,470
medical condition you know how would I

1151
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:31,759
know that care by design would put my

1152
00:44:30,469 --> 00:44:33,649
Crohn's disease into remission

1153
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,380
I was living in Florida and I just heard

1154
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:37,639
CBD in the wind and suddenly Los Angeles

1155
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,108
this is where was happening a company

1156
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:41,750
like canna Kraft was putting making this

1157
00:44:39,108 --> 00:44:44,750
medicine for such a long time so I you

1158
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:46,369
know I urge us not to go down that that

1159
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:48,289
pipeline of oh it's all recreation

1160
00:44:46,369 --> 00:44:50,269
that's all adult use you know let's

1161
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:52,250
start being more conscious of of the

1162
00:44:50,269 --> 00:44:53,630
medical market and you know I think we

1163
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:55,880
should we should praise and honor the

1164
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:57,470
the true medicine makers you know not

1165
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,430
these monopolistic crazy people in Los

1166
00:44:57,469 --> 00:45:01,779
Angeles about the people they were

1167
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:04,969
actually providing medicine to patients

1168
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:07,010
all right well I think I'm sure I forgot

1169
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:08,449
to ask something awesome but we've long

1170
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:10,280
outstripped the cold medicine at this

1171
00:45:08,449 --> 00:45:11,568
point so I think what I would like to

1172
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:14,420
say is I would like to thank everybody

1173
00:45:11,568 --> 00:45:16,279
for listening I'm not sure if anything

1174
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:19,338
was to be learned here but I just wanted

1175
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,650
to have sort of a fun discussion and and

1176
00:45:19,338 --> 00:45:23,299
I thank you all for sticking around for

1177
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:24,110
it and I want to thank our esteemed

1178
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:27,209
panel

1179
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:27,209
