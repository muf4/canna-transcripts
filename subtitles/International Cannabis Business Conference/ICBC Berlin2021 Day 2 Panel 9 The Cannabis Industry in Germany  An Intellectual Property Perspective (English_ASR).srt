1
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:11,599
so i'm thrilled to be here and talk

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:16,120
about intellectual property perspective

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,120
for the cannabis industry today

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,600
right

5
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,679
so i'm gonna

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,000
share some insights about advertising

7
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:27,198
cannabis and cbd products in germany and

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,399
i also will talk about brand protection

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,920
in europe which is really important for

10
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:36,159
you

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,160
let's start with the advertising

12
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:43,119
i will focus on i think the most

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,120
important products which are medicinal

14
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,479
products cosmetics

15
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,479
and food

16
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,479
let's start with the medicinal products

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,840
cannabis or cbd containing drug is

18
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:59,039
subject to prescription in germany

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,359
as you surely know so medicinal products

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,079
subject to prescription may

21
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,320
be advertised only among healthcare

22
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,879
professionals so

23
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,039
it may not be advertised among

24
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:14,079
consumers and consumers

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,000
however if you do advertise it among

26
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,400
healthcare professionals you have to

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,719
observe some

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,320
there are also some limits of course

29
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:27,280
misleading advertising is not permitted

30
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,239
i give you some examples um

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,478
where to

32
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,879
under which it would be misleading for

33
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,679
example if therapotic

34
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,839
efficacy or effects are attributed

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,680
which the medical products do not have

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,920
that would be not allowed

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,159
if the impression is falsely created

38
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,879
that success can be expected with

39
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,359
certainty of course illegal

40
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:52,478
if false or deceptive statements are

41
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:54,959
made about the composition

42
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,718
also not allowed if you use expert

43
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:01,039
opinions

44
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:03,519
which is often done or testimonials

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,360
this must be scientific and properly

46
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,599
cited

47
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,719
if you do not comply with these rules

48
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,719
you

49
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,639
face jail time

50
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:16,159
or at least you get a fine and of course

51
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,359
your material will be confiscated

52
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,318
so

53
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,680
i think more

54
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:26,000
more problematic is the food food and

55
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,719
dietary supplements

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,120
these are some examples i made

57
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,800
screenshots of over the weekend when i

58
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,480
did this presentation

59
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,719
these are all claims from german

60
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,719
websites

61
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,199
there to cbd

62
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:44,479
it says cbd has been shown to inhibit

63
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,359
the appetite cravings or cbd helps with

64
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,159
pain

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,280
stress sleep disorders or

66
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,479
migraine

67
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,919
so the question is if these examples are

68
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,919
allowed under german law

69
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:59,919
again

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
you have to observe the again the act

71
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,679
against unfair competition

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,039
so in general of course unfair

73
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,360
commercial practices are illegal

74
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:12,239
um a commercial practice shall be

75
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,360
regarded as misleading if it content if

76
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,759
it contains false statements regarding

77
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,319
the main characteristics now what does

78
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,878
that mean unfortunately we do not have

79
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:25,598
that much case law in germany

80
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:28,158
on advertisement claims yet we do have a

81
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:30,399
lot of about regulatory questions

82
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:33,519
however i found one

83
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,319
example a recent example from the court

84
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,319
in munich thereto it is unfair to

85
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:41,518
advertise with a statement in a

86
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:44,318
prominent place where two cbd

87
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,080
content is 10

88
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,839
and it is only explained in the small

89
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,959
print that the product actually only

90
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,519
contains contains 10 percent

91
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,680
cbd liquid there's a big difference

92
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,840
between that and there the chord held

93
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,879
that would be a misleading and false

94
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,239
statement

95
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,239
just to give you one example

96
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,840
talk about food and dietary supplements

97
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:10,878
of course you have to observe the eu

98
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,640
health claim regulation

99
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:15,438
there to the use of nutrition health

100
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,439
claims shall not be false ambiguous or

101
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,120
misleading

102
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,839
nutrition and health claims shall be

103
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,439
based on and substantiated by generally

104
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:27,439
accepted scientific data

105
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,160
and at last health claims shall be

106
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,560
permitted unless they are included in a

107
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,320
special list which is part of that

108
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:40,079
regulation and unfortunately until today

109
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,120
cbd is not included in that list

110
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,478
therefore

111
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,800
specific claims linked to cbd

112
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:49,439
linking cbd to health

113
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,759
is not permitted for food

114
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,759
so avoid these health claims i'm sorry

115
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,439
to be a party pooper here but at the

116
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,560
moment this is

117
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,560
the law

118
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,319
so if your product is not a drug you're

119
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,199
not allowed to claim that it's

120
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,918
beneficial for your health

121
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,160
just to give you an example

122
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:08,159
how

123
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,360
or which lar to which large extent the

124
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:18,399
german courts say what um a health claim

125
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,439
is so these are all examples from german

126
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,079
cases

127
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,038
so if you claim your food keeps you

128
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,959
young

129
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,759
that would be

130
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:30,079
not allowed if your food contains cbd or

131
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,560
if you if you only say it it has a

132
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,439
health benefit or it is good for the

133
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,800
body

134
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,759
it's good for

135
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,280
my organism it strengthens the body's

136
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,560
defenses

137
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,000
helps to overcome phases of weakness

138
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,959
so this is

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,560
actually

140
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,879
not so bad but

141
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,038
under german case law this would be a

142
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,038
health claim so the health claim

143
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:53,839
regulation applies

144
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:55,599
and

145
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:58,000
cbd products are not in the list of the

146
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,000
health claims that would be forbidden

147
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,160
or a slim and fit

148
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,800
there's another example

149
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,000
facilitate sleep calm and gentle sleep

150
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,120
or body comes to rest

151
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,120
would be problematic

152
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,918
right

153
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,919
my last

154
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,799
the last thing i would like to share

155
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,719
with you about food and that's um

156
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,400
specifically important for the german

157
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,720
market

158
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,959
so you are manufacturing a manufacturer

159
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,120
and you you claim that you this is not a

160
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:34,239
drug it's it's only a dietary supplement

161
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,038
let's say still you advertise it as a

162
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,519
drug so from the overall get up the

163
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:42,318
claims and the advertising you use it

164
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:44,240
looks like a medicinal product

165
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,120
in these cases

166
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,800
the courts would say that it is a drug

167
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,680
and then you have a problem because you

168
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,879
didn't get drug approval in advance

169
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,759
so whenever yeah yeah just watch out not

170
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,598
to to make the presentation of your

171
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,360
product to

172
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:02,800
look like too much as a medicinal

173
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,199
product because then

174
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,840
it could be helped that it is actually a

175
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,000
drug even though you did not plan that

176
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,239
and this is specifically important for

177
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,399
the german market

178
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,720
right um

179
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,879
the last uh thing is the cosmetic

180
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,599
products

181
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:24,800
again i made some um here are some

182
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,399
examples from german websites i found

183
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,478
there too

184
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:32,560
it was claimed that cbd products

185
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,279
are particularly good against skin

186
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,680
diseases

187
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:40,879
scientists have investigated

188
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,560
cbd fights the cause of acne at its

189
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,639
roots

190
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,598
well the question is whether this would

191
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,759
be allowed under german law

192
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:50,719
so

193
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,120
under

194
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,360
the cosmetic regulations whatever you

195
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,759
say it has to be true of course

196
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,160
so if it is claimed on the product that

197
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:04,080
it contains a specific ingredient the

198
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,199
ingredient shall be deliberately present

199
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,918
or

200
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,759
marketing communications shall not imply

201
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,079
that expressions of opinions are

202
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,360
verified claims unless the opinion

203
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,878
reflects

204
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,960
verifiable evidence so you always need

205
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,720
verifiable evidence when you make a

206
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:26,638
cross claim for your cosmetic product

207
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,960
further you need evidential support

208
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,280
so claims for cosmetic products shall be

209
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,519
supported by adequate and again

210
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:36,000
verifiable evidence

211
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,839
evidence for claim substantiation shall

212
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,679
take into account state of the art

213
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,480
practices and at last where studies are

214
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:47,599
being used as evidence

215
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,720
they shall be relevant to that product

216
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,879
so just not using any any

217
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,480
evidence it always have to be exactly

218
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:58,958
for your product then you can use it

219
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,080
okay so that was uh in the limited

220
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:04,639
amount of time a really narrow insights

221
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,839
about the strict rules of advertising in

222
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:10,080
the cannabis field until

223
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,440
today and at last i would like to share

224
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,759
some

225
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,800
thoughts about brand protection i'm

226
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:19,519
handling trademarks for

227
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,359
the cannabis industry since 2017

228
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,200
obviously in germany

229
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,759
and i brought you some

230
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,800
recent case law about

231
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,519
cannabis trademark so that that one is

232
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,679
um a quite important one from the

233
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,080
european court of justice

234
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:40,639
the cannabis store amsterdam

235
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,959
unfortunately it was rejected

236
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:46,000
the european court stated that this

237
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:50,399
would be contrary to public policy or to

238
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,639
accepted principles of morality

239
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,720
yeah i find it quite astonishing i think

240
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,199
it's a beautiful trademark but somehow

241
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,120
the courts saw it differently

242
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,480
they acknowledge that the cannabis

243
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,320
consumption is

244
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,519
generally legal in the netherlands

245
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,920
however

246
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,159
a violation of the public order in other

247
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:10,639
eu countries would be sufficient for the

248
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:13,519
rejection of the mark

249
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,958
so and that was a starting point for

250
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,039
many more

251
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:20,319
trademark decisions we had afterwards

252
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,679
with

253
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,440
terms of

254
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,838
yeah some

255
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,240
for cannabis products like this one it's

256
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,000
quite recent a decision from the board

257
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,278
of the appeal of the european trademark

258
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,278
office

259
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:36,559
again it says it

260
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:38,799
is contrary to the public policy

261
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:41,439
the marks conveyed a message related to

262
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:44,159
the consumption of prohibited and

263
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,399
harmful substances and therefore were

264
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,559
rejected

265
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,440
also this one which is

266
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:55,838
i think not so drastic but still it was

267
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,839
um rejected the well weed

268
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,278
here this is in quite interesting

269
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,600
because the applicant cited the

270
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,360
ruling of the european of um

271
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,200
the european court of justice from

272
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,360
november last year

273
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:15,519
there too as you probably all know the

274
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:17,839
cannabinoid was held is legal for um

275
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,000
yeah for bringing over the over from

276
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,320
france i think to germany it was held

277
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,278
that this cannot be stopped it may be

278
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,000
freely marketed so they held that um

279
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:30,078
hemp is actually legal so the applicant

280
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,720
argued how can you are how can you say

281
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:36,000
this infringes public policy

282
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,200
well um the opinion of the board was not

283
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,839
changed so they they uh the the mark got

284
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,839
rejected unfortunately

285
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:47,039
all these on the left side

286
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
are

287
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:52,319
certain types of cannabis all these were

288
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,559
rejected because again

289
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,800
contrary to the public policy and the

290
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,078
principles of morality

291
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,559
also

292
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:03,919
bavaria wheat

293
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:03,919
and the hemp fest

294
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,839
right so

295
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,759
yeah you see despite the greater

296
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,000
tolerance toward the consumption of

297
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:15,120
mariana within the eu

298
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,519
it uh still it's still problematic so

299
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,399
until today i would advise my clients

300
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:23,278
not to use words like mariana cannabis

301
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,399
hemp grass pot wheat hush or anything

302
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,600
like that so

303
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,120
because you probably get a rejection

304
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,480
um

305
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,720
right and at last we also have

306
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,639
purely descriptive trademarks

307
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,879
these are some examples

308
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,519
cheese is also a type of cannabis no you

309
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,278
cannabis the court said well that only

310
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,600
says well you know what is in your

311
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:47,360
product so it's purely descriptive and

312
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,278
whenever you have a purely descriptive

313
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,240
trademark you cannot monopolize it and

314
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:56,480
you cannot register it the same happened

315
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,399
to just cbd cannot farm midi hemp

316
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,440
ease

317
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,679
was also one i handled and lost

318
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,279
unfortunately because the court said

319
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:06,479
well it was not the court it was the

320
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:07,759
board of appeal of the european

321
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,480
trademark office

322
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:13,360
they held well this only tells the

323
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,360
consumer what the cbd in the product

324
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,278
makes to your body

325
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,560
it releases and so it's purely

326
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:22,639
descriptive and not legible for

327
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,078
trademark protection

328
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,639
right thank you so much for your

329
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:26,638
attention

330
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,000
okay sure

331
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:38,000
all right you can be first

332
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,079
um may i go back to the the the

333
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,720
trademark you for the dutch for the

334
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:45,519
dutch one the cannabis

335
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,759
um could it be a solution that you first

336
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,919
put it in the benelux

337
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:53,360
how you could trademarks and then maybe

338
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:56,000
afterwards go to the european

339
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,639
i remember that that was like a trick

340
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,958
many many years ago if whenever you

341
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,959
because i'm from germany and the german

342
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,439
patent office was really strict so what

343
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,278
we did we advise our clients go to the

344
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,360
benelux and then you file an

345
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,278
international trademark and then nobody

346
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,039
really looks anymore what happened there

347
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,759
but i don't think this

348
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,719
still works actually because when you

349
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,639
your

350
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,199
your idea is we go to the banner looks

351
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,360
you probably get it because they're very

352
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:24,319
easy to get trademarks still what i

353
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,240
heard

354
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,519
then you file an international trademark

355
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,720
based on the on that mark but then

356
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,519
this

357
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,759
application goes to the specific

358
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,919
trademark offices where you apply for

359
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,159
let's say germany us

360
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:43,120
or the european union

361
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:45,198
and there is an examiner and he or she

362
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,720
will examine the trademark under their

363
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:49,278
law

364
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,560
so i don't think that this will help you

365
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:52,639
just because you have the banner looks

366
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,078
mark the german examiner will still say

367
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,480
well here in germany you don't get the

368
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:59,120
trademark protection

369
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,000
did i answer your question okay

370
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,240
sorry yeah thank you uh madam

371
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,120
hello i have a question related to

372
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,799
cosmetics cbd cosmetics so if you're in

373
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,839
a brochure or whatever which you hand

374
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,958
out

375
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,519
maybe not to the patients but to the

376
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:19,198
pharmacist so if you

377
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:23,120
for example state an oil a cream which

378
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:25,599
you put on your term is poisy or can

379
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,879
be anti-inflammatory as a khan and

380
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,278
sundung semen work and how about that

381
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:33,679
yeah that's a born-a-line case

382
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:35,639
you just have to whenever you make

383
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,439
claims like that can be

384
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,159
anti-inflammatory you actually need

385
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,839
evidence for that you cannot just say

386
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:44,799
something it's just saying no evidence

387
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,320
it may be anti-inflammatory people have

388
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,639
reported

389
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,079
that it's a some people say

390
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,639
i get it and you know what what is

391
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,879
possible and i see that on websites i

392
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,759
see that at like they say

393
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,278
there

394
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,199
are a lot of

395
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,838
research done yet

396
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:03,278
still we are at the beginning we cannot

397
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,839
say 400

398
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:07,600
sure but we see the trend goes there so

399
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,720
that would be possible

400
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:14,399
you know just to be honest to say where

401
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:17,120
we are right now and i think actually

402
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,759
me as a consumer from a consumer side i

403
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,278
would feel more confident with that

404
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,360
just you know

405
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,439
promise something which you don't really

406
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,600
maybe cannot answer now in america

407
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,000
there's always a little asterisk and

408
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,639
then very small print this has not been

409
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,958
proven by the fda or

410
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:39,919
we're probably lying but we're doing our

411
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:42,479
best okay yeah that's a good solution

412
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:44,799
so many thanks for the nice insights and

413
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,480
i have them to elaborate with the topic

414
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,958
claims so

415
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,879
you can make claims as soon as they are

416
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,799
supported by verifiable data you

417
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:55,439
mentioned that but how does the law

418
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:57,198
define verifiable data as a scientist i

419
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,959
guess that's scientific data but even

420
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:01,439
within scientific literature there are

421
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:05,119
different levels of evidence for example

422
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:08,240
the use of cbd as anti-agnet is is

423
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:10,558
published in the cell model so this

424
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,359
pre-clinical data it's still and we know

425
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:12,959
which

426
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,198
biochemical mechanism makes this

427
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,600
possible so it is a fact in science

428
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,798
can you use this claim or do they the

429
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:23,119
law means uh randomized clinical trial

430
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:25,439
placebo control so this pre-clinical

431
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:28,239
data double blind

432
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,519
randomized study okay because for that

433
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,120
there are only four applications of

434
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,759
cannabis which are actually have this

435
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,519
kind of study so if you go beyond this

436
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,279
for applications you cannot use spray

437
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,679
clinical data i mean if it's published

438
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,038
in nature or science or why not yeah

439
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,038
it's um

440
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:46,640
yeah there's a great risk

441
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,640
that it would be illegal absolutely

442
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:53,599
you just have to make clear that this is

443
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,839
not randomized double etc

444
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,918
okay so you could use it and be clear

445
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:00,000
that this is based on this level of

446
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,080
evidence in science okay because it

447
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,160
brings me to my second question which is

448
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,639
i mean you give many examples regarding

449
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,519
food for instance what you cannot write

450
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,000
so

451
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:12,798
health claims yeah so what will be an

452
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,119
example of what you can actually write

453
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:16,798
if you at least one example

454
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,399
used to have the context i mean it's

455
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:21,759
very clear what you cannot write but

456
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:25,038
what we have like um

457
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:27,200
probably but this is you know

458
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:29,200
this is very specific and of course but

459
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,080
uh but that we do have case law where

460
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,600
the courts say that might be okay to say

461
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:37,519
become lich

462
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:39,519
which is in in english good for your uh

463
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:40,798
what is it in english like

464
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,119
regards

465
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:45,440
digestive so so there are some

466
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:48,639
expressions where they say well actually

467
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,798
this doesn't really refer to the health

468
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,799
so it's always about if you if you say

469
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:54,960
you feel really better it makes an

470
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,400
influence on your body then it's a

471
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,200
health claim

472
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,519
but

473
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,720
yeah as i said this is um a very

474
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:05,038
difficult question a difficult matter

475
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,960
and it's from um

476
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,679
case to case we have to

477
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,558
to evaluate it all right right it's not

478
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:15,919
an easy one to just offer so if i if my

479
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:17,678
anti-acne cream cbd cream says okay this

480
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,559
can help you address acne with the

481
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:23,200
asterisk based on preclinical data that

482
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:26,319
you can find in this scientific journal

483
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,120
i might get away with that or

484
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:28,720
yeah

485
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:31,119
sorry

486
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,200
why don't we have a chat outside and we

487
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:34,798
make her

488
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,000
a special deal

489
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:39,000
we have one more over here

490
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,880
hi

491
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,798
let's say my wettest dream comes true

492
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,360
and cannabis becomes

493
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:49,839
fully legalized and we have a regulated

494
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:52,558
market here in germany on the eu member

495
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:54,798
state level what does it mean for this

496
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,879
topic on the eu level

497
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:58,480
yeah it would be a big change for

498
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,679
i mean

499
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,079
then

500
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,720
it would i guess it would not take long

501
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:08,000
until it's included in the list of for

502
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,400
the um admitted health claims

503
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,640
and then you can actually

504
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,798
claim that your food is beneficial for

505
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,520
your health which you until now i mean

506
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,960
you

507
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:18,158
you're not even allowed in germany to

508
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,240
bring it on the market in the first

509
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,679
place and not we're not talking about

510
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,000
advertisement but

511
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,720
if we as you said if we

512
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,759
in if we're in the future and we can do

513
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,159
that

514
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:32,000
and then i guess we you have to wait

515
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,000
until it's also in the list of the

516
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,440
health claims and then you can use

517
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,960
beneficial health claims for the food

518
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,720
so that would make a difference

519
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,240
i'd like to expand on the question

520
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,798
before that

521
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,200
so would you think that

522
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:53,279
for health claims it would

523
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,279
need to test the product specifically

524
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:59,200
for health benefits

525
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:01,519
instead of the isolated compound

526
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,640
you mean what is the procedure to get

527
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:07,440
accepted in that list yes uh can you can

528
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,400
you take results from uh science and

529
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,360
look at the isolated uh product or would

530
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,320
you need to take your uh your product

531
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:18,959
that contains cbd to test for these

532
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:18,960
health claims

533
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,879
i'm i'm an appeal lawyer not so much

534
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,399
regulatory i don't i don't really with

535
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,720
the regulatory issues that there's a

536
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,360
colleagues of me so i don't know how you

537
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,919
actually get the how the procedure works

538
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,158
to get uh registered at the health claim

539
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,880
as an admitted health claim

540
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,480
so

541
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,480
i don't want to answer that because i

542
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,319
don't really know how what exactly you

543
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,960
need to do if it's the ingredient or the

544
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,759
product i guess it's the ingredient

545
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,200
yeah that was wonderful and perfect and

546
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,558

547
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,080
