1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,009
unless you've been really living under a

2
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:06,719
rock and you're involved in the

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,250
following not involved and fall in the

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,320
international scene you may not know

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,048
what blockchain is but the next speaker

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,388
is an expert on the matter she is an

7
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:17,129
ex-marine expatriate who's stationed

8
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:19,710
here in Germany who writes about

9
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:22,910
cannabis and business news and breaks

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,740
stories here in Germany and her company

11
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,969
medpay Rx is an innovative blockchain

12
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:28,679
company and she'll tell you what that

13
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:31,259
entails so please give a warm welcome

14
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:38,238
for ms Marguerite Arnold

15
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:39,750
[Applause]

16
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,939
thank you all

17
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,950
I mean I'm after lunch from the act but

18
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:46,619
thank you all for making it back thank

19
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,629
you also thank you very much to Alex and

20
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:49,558
team for making the sophomore year of

21
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:51,149
the ICBC

22
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:52,468
what it is right can we have a round of

23
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:58,109
applause they have worked their butts

24
00:00:52,469 --> 00:01:00,239
off right so yes my name is Marguerite

25
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,329
Arnold and I'm here to give you a very

26
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:05,908
quick easy deep dive in 15 minutes on a

27
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,769
new technology called blockchain and how

28
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:10,229
it is going to disrupt our already

29
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:13,590
disruptive business and it is going to

30
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:16,408
it's gonna be big there are lots of ways

31
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,659
to think about this right but one of the

32
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,580
easiest ways to begin to understand how

33
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,820
this technology works and how you can

34
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:26,219
apply it in what you do is to understand

35
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:28,828
that it is a protocol so the geeks in

36
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:30,319
the audience who know what tcp/ip is for

37
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:32,819
voice it's what makes your handiwork

38
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:35,279
right or those people who understand

39
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:37,199
what HTTPS is which really allows you to

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,820
type in google.com as opposed to a

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,070
string of numbers in your browser and

42
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:43,438
have that website come back those are

43
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:45,359
protocols this is what blockchain is

44
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,099
it's just a little bit more geeky and

45
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,989
it's coming out of the banking industry

46
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:53,069
in particular and it functions along a

47
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:54,899
pretty simple idea kyc now for the

48
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:56,789
uninitiated and audience and the people

49
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,280
who are still asleep this is not a new

50
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:04,380
brand of cannabis flavored sex jell-o

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,790
they maybe you should it actually comes

52
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:08,038
out of banking geek speek and it means

53
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,659
know your client in other words you need

54
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,829
to know everything about your clients so

55
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:12,909
they're not a terrorist and where they

56
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,280
live and what their bank account is at

57
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:17,568
but within the context of what

58
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,090
blockchain really is going to be beyond

59
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:22,519
banking it really means being able to

60
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:25,159
understand and verify if not

61
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,950
authenticate many many different points

62
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:29,449
of data in a complex ecosystem without

63
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:31,068
necessarily having all of the knowledge

64
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:33,349
that you would traditionally have or

65
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:35,208
think that you need and if that sounds

66
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:36,379
like the cannabis business in general

67
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:41,949
yes

68
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:45,650
and that is exactly where its eyes face

69
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:47,119
but again this is kind of abstract so

70
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:50,330
I'm going to give you a little bit of a

71
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,340
fun example about how to understand this

72
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:54,680
kind of verification in this kind of

73
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:59,239
environment so I've already told you my

74
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:01,550
name and you can both hear and see me

75
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,319
whether you think about that or not

76
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,390
those are three different independent

77
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:07,039
verification points that tells your

78
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:09,169
brain you're here in Berlin and not on

79
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,349
Mars and if you're on Mars we'll check

80
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:14,238
in with you later

81
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:16,068
some of you yes also know me as an

82
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,900
industry journalist and if you don't you

83
00:03:16,068 --> 00:03:22,609
can google me that's another kind of

84
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:26,180
independent verification I'm also a

85
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:28,850
blockchain enthusiast if not expert but

86
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,200
where does that come from so let me give

87
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:32,479
you a little bit more information that

88
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:35,780
you can also verify via very different

89
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,909
ideas and channels as I say to all of my

90
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,430
German friends yes ich bin ein

91
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:45,069
amerikaner in flew clear of on Trump I'm

92
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:48,590
an American refugee I'm actually the

93
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:50,389
very very old German family that I can

94
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,859
trace back close to a thousand years to

95
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:57,099
actually come back here to live and

96
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:57,100
that's really cool but I did grow up

97
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:03,699
I did grow up in an unusual family no

98
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,280
that's not me in the picture that was a

99
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:08,259
good friend of my dad's my two paternal

100
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,150
uncles were people you probably know or

101
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:12,310
heard heard of one of them was a guy

102
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,020
named Peter Drucker you know the father

103
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,939
of business and the information worker

104
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:19,209
and the other one deciphered the Dead

105
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:21,250
Sea Scrolls so it was interesting and

106
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:23,439
and this was a little fella that I met

107
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,689
at the age of eight the father of that

108
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:28,870
is a guy named gray Walter he was one of

109
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:31,930
the early early pioneers really in in

110
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:35,230
robotics and cyber kinetics and where a

111
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,850
lot of this has come from and turtle I

112
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,560
met this guy when I was eight years old

113
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,900
he would scuttle around on the floor

114
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,009
came in order to go to like plug himself

115
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:44,560
back in the wall when he ran out of

116
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:46,300
juice and I met this guy at the age of

117
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,180
eight when the world was just meeting

118
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:52,120
r2d2 for the first time so I think that

119
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,100
this was love at first sight but beyond

120
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,810
that that's kind of where I've worked

121
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,910
and I've taken elements of this from

122
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,949
banking and technology that I've worked

123
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,410
on and and and the kinds of industries

124
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:04,420
that I've pulled together of my life to

125
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,580
try and bring together what I'm doing

126
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,100
now but if you want to think about what

127
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:11,949
blockchain is at its fundamental level

128
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:15,100
it is a language that allows robots and

129
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:17,168
computers to alt and occasionally humans

130
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,030
while they still let us to all talk to

131
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:22,479
one another in a new and different way

132
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:24,489
and they also it also allows people to

133
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,640
connect very different sources of data

134
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:32,168
and people and enterprises in a new kind

135
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:35,649
of ecosystem all blockchains also use

136
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:37,629
coins or tokens or smart contracts these

137
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:39,579
terms are used interchangeably and

138
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:41,319
increasingly it's not up to you to

139
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:43,060
define what those are it's other

140
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:45,159
compliance systems and i'ma get it to

141
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,160
that in a second but this make no

142
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,780
mistake about it is the backbone

143
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,210
infrastructure technology between behind

144
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:53,829
IOT which is the Internet of Things it's

145
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:55,930
going to be interacting with with AI

146
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:58,509
it's going to be responsible for all

147
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,090
sorts of automation drones I joke about

148
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:06,519
that one's coming soon it's a wild stuff

149
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:07,529
but how do you use it and as cannabis

150
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:09,189
executives

151
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:12,759
OMG and

152
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:15,160
thing to deal with right so so which

153
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:17,170
blockchain do you use as their a couple

154
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,330
right there's Bitcoin which was a block

155
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:22,030
team before it was a coin there's a

156
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:24,550
theorem there is ether they're all

157
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:27,189
different and which cyber currency

158
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:29,889
because they're all tied to those I'm

159
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:32,500
gonna make it easy for you cost speed

160
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,969
and energy efficiency are the three

161
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,610
things that you should immediately be

162
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:38,770
looking for because ultimately all block

163
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,240
chains also use electricity so at every

164
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:42,519
hop of the node they're using

165
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,550
electricity to do something so you're

166
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:47,169
looking for that as well

167
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,790
but what you're really looking for right

168
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,379
now because the block chains that are

169
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:54,640
out there are pretty impressive already

170
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:56,500
is what are called taps now this is just

171
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,750
you know short term for distributed

172
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,399
application if you've taken a look at

173
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,670
the pretty front end it looks like a

174
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:05,409
regular app the difference is that we

175
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,150
are not tying into any sort of

176
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,010
centralized system this is all

177
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:10,629
decentralized from the back and I'm

178
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:12,629
going to show you a little bit about the

179
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:14,649
engineering but beyond the technology

180
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:16,540
you've got to look for what that gap

181
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:19,179
actually does does it do something that

182
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:24,280
solves your business problem and if it

183
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:26,560
doesn't keep moving this is the back end

184
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:30,250
a very artistic representation of what

185
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:33,250
our system looks like the doctor here we

186
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,959
never issue a coin as medpay rx we never

187
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,540
issue a coin we never sell it it's never

188
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:39,279
going to be available on any exchange it

189
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,950
cannot be stolen because it's not worth

190
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:45,149
anything in the traditional idea we have

191
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:48,370
taken the idea of what a prescription is

192
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:50,409
it's a contract between multiple parties

193
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,540
and two payers and we've set up a

194
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,730
banking system to allow that to happen

195
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,860
we never transfer medical data on this

196
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,850
what happens is that the doctor is the

197
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,470
issuing bank

198
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,629
they're the ones who issue the coin and

199
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:03,820
it goes first to the insurer who

200
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:06,279
hopefully not only underwrites it but

201
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:08,529
approves it it then goes to the patient

202
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:10,659
who is able to copay and forward that to

203
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:12,759
the bank while pushing well sending a

204
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,620
push notification to the distributor to

205
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:16,329
tell you guys you know the real-time

206
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,069
information about where your product is

207
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,659
in play and where is it going we deal

208
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:21,250
with rebates as well and I can give you

209
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,110
more information if you want to stop by

210
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,149
the booth the idea was not to promote

211
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,840
medpay but i want to show you the

212
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:30,879
difference between what we're doing and

213
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,949
an ICO because I'm sure you guys have

214
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,429
all heard about this too so what is an

215
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,120
ICO

216
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:40,899
an ICO is just Geek Speak for an initial

217
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,700
coining sometimes they're called TG tte

218
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:45,250
events token generation events it's

219
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,590
basically the same idea a private entity

220
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,350
or even a nonprofit or a government if

221
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:52,269
she's a coin it could be for term a

222
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:55,360
raise of money it could be for a

223
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:58,059
community etc but the moment that you're

224
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,259
charging a customer for that coin for

225
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:00,959
whatever it is that you're doing it

226
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:03,309
you're in the financial space and

227
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:06,280
everywhere now no matter where you are

228
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:08,319
that is federal banking law that you

229
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:10,899
have to be in compliance with so I'm

230
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,670
gonna back up here second this has to be

231
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:15,100
in compliance if we rolled out correctly

232
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:17,319
with German banking Jeremy banking

233
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,210
privacy and medical privacy law this is

234
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,629
prescriptions that's the idea where

235
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:24,639
we're putting a digital focus in process

236
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:27,909
on a system that has already been

237
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:30,100
established under compliance this is

238
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:32,379
something that for the financial geeks

239
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,180
in the room looks very much like a stock

240
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:37,779
issuance right because that's what it is

241
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:40,029
and that is why this is also so

242
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:42,579
incredibly dangerous right now for this

243
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:44,620
industry especially in the United States

244
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,540
for reasons that include everything

245
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,820
about you cannot have a bank account and

246
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:51,459
in other places you have to make sure

247
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,580
that this model is also in compliance

248
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:56,500
with everything else that you're doing

249
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:58,720
so there's nothing wrong with this and

250
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,850
in fact this is a very smart way to

251
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,350
raise money for things like drones I

252
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:05,019
mean I joke about this all the time

253
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:07,029
right drones are going to be paid for by

254
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:08,919
cyber currency a lot of the top

255
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:11,230
companies are raising money for them and

256
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:13,149
all airspace is going to be controlled

257
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:15,070
low-lying air spaces can be controlled

258
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:17,139
by blockchain systems which are going to

259
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:19,629
be paid for by rent with cyber currency

260
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:22,149
and airspace does in fact have a value

261
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:24,220
however crazy that may sound in that

262
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:25,329
particular kind of instance great but

263
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,730
then what are you going to be carrying

264
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:29,620
so in other words all of the steps that

265
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,129
you have to go through for a successful

266
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,019
IC o----

267
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:34,149
you're going to have to go through to

268
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:36,429
raise money successfully via other ways

269
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:38,110
anyway so if you do and I

270
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:40,088
see oh you better be in compliance you

271
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,850
better have a good lawyer you better be

272
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:43,930
working closely with a bank everywhere

273
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,820
so those are the those are the issues

274
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:47,349
it's not that they're necessarily all

275
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,580
bad it's just that they're very

276
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:52,870
dangerous if you don't know what you're

277
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:54,339
doing so the takeaways because I'd like

278
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,950
to end this early because I know there

279
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:59,080
are some questions if you're looking at

280
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:01,810
this in trying to evaluate blockchain

281
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:04,570
for your business I would stay away from

282
00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:05,889
the hottest greatest cannabis blockchain

283
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,020
out there and there are a couple out

284
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:13,838
there they could be great they could not

285
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:15,699
be right look for what the gaps do on

286
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,279
that existing blockchain do they solve

287
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,620
your problem do they not are they

288
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:22,419
compliance are they in compliance and

289
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,950
are they in compliance in all the

290
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:25,809
different industry verticals that they

291
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:28,990
are acquired to be in compliance with I

292
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:31,809
use a banking app that allows you to buy

293
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,889
cannabis for example in Canada you're

294
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:35,139
gonna have to make sure that your users

295
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:40,240
are over 21 those are kinds of ideas

296
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:43,208
right as my late uncle Peter used to say

297
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,940
technology is just a tool and it doesn't

298
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:49,389
solve your problem why bother with it so

299
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:51,940
look for that too and icos and token

300
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:52,919
generation have their place but just be

301
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,720
careful

302
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:57,939
so on that note I think I'm going to end

303
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:05,019
this and open it up for any questions

304
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:09,070
there might be and go from there do we

305
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:11,740
have a question or to anyone who just

306
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:15,370
raised your hand I can see you have a

307
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:17,379
question about the bit chain of the

308
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,129
blockchain what kind of see where oh

309
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:23,200
there he is over there

310
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:25,828
okay I'm coming I've eaten a lot of

311
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:31,509
bread I think I have gained some weight

312
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:34,899
lots of cake thanks a lot for that very

313
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:38,230
informative presentation would you maybe

314
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:40,629
in regards to the ico have any source or

315
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:44,440
credible good information that you could

316
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:46,028
recommend about about what like where

317
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:50,140
you can find out if you're doing it and

318
00:12:46,028 --> 00:12:52,509
are you doing it in Germany swiss-based

319
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:54,909
Swiss bass okay so the Swiss actually I

320
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:57,338
mean again there that's wit Switzerland

321
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:59,620
and a couple of countries in the Far

322
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:01,570
East are actually good places to

323
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,179
actually do icos but here's the next

324
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:07,240
problem so the rumor in Frankfurt last

325
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:09,969
month was that no German bank would be

326
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,528
accepting ICO funds no matter where

327
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,990
those funds were raised and for what a

328
00:13:11,528 --> 00:13:16,990
purpose why because even if they knew

329
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:18,789
the identity of your of you and all the

330
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:21,329
people you were getting money from they

331
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:23,349
could not trace the source of the coin

332
00:13:21,328 --> 00:13:25,000
remember these all of these are

333
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,379
anonymous coins they couldn't appear out

334
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,089
with the coins are so the German

335
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:29,110
authorities are not really hip to this

336
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:31,600
and if you're going to be doing business

337
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,980
in Germany raising money by an IC o----

338
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,360
is that's one of the things you have to

339
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,100
consider if you're going to be doing

340
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,450
business in Switzerland if you're gonna

341
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,639
have one of these things happening in

342
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,350
Russia with the funds or maybe Singapore

343
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:43,449
or etc but the banks are a lot more

344
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,560
interested in this kind of activity then

345
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,149
where are you going to spend those funds

346
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,669
and that's one of the problems

347
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:50,019
downstream with us so that's just an

348
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:51,909
issue just mean there are people who are

349
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:58,799
doing it successfully but you just have

350
00:13:51,909 --> 00:14:00,909
to be aware like how secure are

351
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,109
blockchains or bitcoins or whatever

352
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:03,429
they're called from like government

353
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,839
intrusion like what's to stop some

354
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:07,389
government from just shutting everything

355
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:09,490
down and then everybody's out well I

356
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:11,139
mean that's that that's actually a

357
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:13,360
couple of questions but let me just

358
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:15,129
answer this first one on government

359
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,990
interference in cyber currency the

360
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:19,720
Chinese government actually has just

361
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:22,209
moved in to stop exchanges and they

362
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,889
don't like ICS very much either if you

363
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,778
think that this is out there and not

364
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:28,028
regulated and they can't do it yeah they

365
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:29,889
can just cut the switch off they can do

366
00:14:28,028 --> 00:14:31,328
a lot of tracing all of the cyber

367
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:33,370
currency that is traded in the United

368
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:35,679
States right now has got to be listed on

369
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,990
these exchanges and the IRS when you

370
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:40,859
sell them looks at this you know as a

371
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:43,980
capital gain I did

372
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:46,680
it's changing quickly so again be

373
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,028
careful alright thank you very much it's

374
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:49,379
