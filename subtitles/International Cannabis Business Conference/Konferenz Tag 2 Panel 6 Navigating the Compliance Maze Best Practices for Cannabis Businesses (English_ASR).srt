here from North America who have been

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,679

21
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:45,479
legal cannabis industry

22
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,100

primarily a medical device company for

61
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,098
where FDA cleared for blood and we got

62
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:28,378
into cannabis about five years ago so uh

63
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:28,979

Australia

77
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,200
Chile

78
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:06,539
Central America North America and of

79
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:09,179
course here in Europe

80
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:12,658
all right so

81
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:16,680
let's talk about how you've grown your

82
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:19,378
respective businesses in this uh very

83
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,680
rapidly evolving regulatory landscape

84
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:24,658
and this very Dynamic industry have you

85
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,980
grown your businesses throughout all of

86
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:31,919
that and what opportunities excite you

87
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:33,598
outside of North America Beyond where

88
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,919
wherever you're targeting and the rest

89
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,158
of the world let's start with you Jill

90
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:37,158
okay

91
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,140
States cannabis were based on of Denver

92
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,878
Colorado and that was really the first

93
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:51,000
moment that the state started

94
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:53,939
contemplating testing for total yeast

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,639
and mold and other types of pathogens so

96
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:59,280
I know Arthur and I can debate who came

97
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:02,339
to Market first I think we both kind of

98
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,439
started in the fall of 2015. but you

99
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,840
know what was interesting is that there

100
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,359
was no pathway there was no groundwork

101
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,120
for what a kill step for what

102
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,340
decontamination looked like at that time

103
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:18,120
and it's been interesting to see the

104
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:20,699
evolution but back in 2015 I mean I had

105
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:25,139
to go to the state of Colorado and say

106
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:27,840
listen this is necessary for cultivators

107
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:30,660
to operate in you know a regulated

108
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,819
market but then also that we're

109
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,100
protecting consumer safety I mean they

110
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:36,418
hadn't even contemplated that if a

111
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,820
cultivator was presented with

112
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:41,579
contamination based on the the test

113
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:42,540
results they had required there's no

114
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:45,300
solution

115
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,520
and so we really had to give them

116
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,918
suggestions we had to lay the groundwork

117
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,839
for them and let them know here's what

118
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,939
you need to do and here's why you need

119
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,819
to consider you know food safety

120
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:58,439
standards coming into cannabis

121
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:00,060
um so we really helped the state of

122
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:01,978
Colorado understand what that looked

123
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,680
like and we also helped them move

124
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:05,418
towards coining this phrase

125
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,579
decontamination

126
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:10,439
as other states started to legalize I

127
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:13,859
mean it's just been this kind of like

128
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:16,620
siled mess of regulations no state has

129
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,199
the same testing requirements so we've

130
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,319
kind of had to rinse and repeat the same

131
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,060
process with all the other states

132
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:26,038
letting The Regulators understand that

133
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,319
there needs to be a pathway towards

134
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:31,079
treating product to ensuring that the

135
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:34,079
product does not have microbial

136
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:35,939
contamination you know looking at the

137
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,639
international market I mean these

138
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:40,500
standards are set and so I feel like

139
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,079
it's a much better pathway for

140
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:47,399
cultivators to have best practice to

141
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:50,099
best practices but the US is it's been a

142
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:52,500
huge challenge

143
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,840
yeah from my perspective uh you know we

144
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,819
since we're a global company as well not

145
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,459
only in blood but we've even got a unit

146
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:01,319
here in Berlin that does the vaccine

147
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:03,538
they're working on the vaccine for Ebola

148
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,759
but the the regulations are different

149
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:09,180
for a cannabis as it applies to your

150
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,379
Market in the European Union

151
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,418
um not only do you have the federal

152
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:14,579
European

153
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:16,740
um uh regulations to deal with but you

154
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:18,359
also have Regional ones so even within

155
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,879
Germany you know you have 28 different

156
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,979
regions or I believe that there are some

157
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,199
of them are broken down even further so

158
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:27,360
just understanding

159
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,639
um the regulations within your region

160
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,259
and and partnering with the right people

161
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,740
in order to make sure that you're

162
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:36,538
actually solving a problem remember you

163
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,538
guys are out there you're thinking oh I

164
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:42,060
want to make money right but being there

165
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:43,439
to be to solve a problem because that's

166
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,180
when The Regulators are going to really

167
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,120
work with you and you're going to be

168
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,519
able to partner with them better

169
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,280
by solving a problem that they have

170
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:54,839
generally around Public Safety but also

171
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,698
um remember they're funded by the people

172
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:59,000
as well so you want to Serve the People

173
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,000
well

174
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:04,620
I'm going to give a shout out to GMP

175
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,418
incorporating GMP into a cannabis

176
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,120
regulatory framework

177
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:10,099
leads to more predictable outcomes it's

178
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,079
generally

179
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:15,840
you know a safer approach more

180
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,939
predictable repeatable results

181
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,399
and

182
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:22,560
you know in a previous life I was a

183
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,978
country manager for ashrazeneca so if

184
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,139
you come from Big Pharma GMP is

185
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:30,918
ingrained into your DNA

186
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,918
and

187
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:39,598
I I to Jill's point and George's point

188
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:42,360
the U.S market has been chaotic to put

189
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:44,639
it short so I would not look to the

190
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,419
United States as your model for doing it

191
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,939
here

192
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:50,219
and I think that the

193
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:51,779
the U.S market can best be summed up and

194
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,300
antidote from Winston Churchill who

195
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:55,619
famously said I trust the Americans to

196
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,900
do the right thing

197
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,478
after trying everything else

198
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:03,299
so don't don't look to the United States

199
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,740
for Best Practices we've got our scars

200
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,900
on our back we've we've made our

201
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:10,560
mistakes

202
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:14,939
yeah well that's well said unfortunately

203
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:18,180
uh so let's share some thoughts on how

204
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:20,160
to partner with regulatory bodies on

205
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,478
moving the ball forward as well as with

206
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,419
partners

207
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:26,459
Growers who might need some assistance

208
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:27,959
in meeting some of their regulatory

209
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:30,418
objectives why don't we start with you

210
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:31,978
George thank you Brian I'd like to say

211
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:34,559
you're doing a lovely job I hope you're

212
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:37,139
nice and relaxed twenty dollars in the

213
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,179
mail okay

214
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:41,759
so partnering with the right people is

215
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:44,819
is a matter of like I said trying to

216
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,620
solve a problem so um especially in this

217
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,200
environment you got to understand your

218
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:54,679
regulatory under uh requirements in each

219
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,680
country plus EU rules plus you know uh

220
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,480
anything that's overwhelming

221
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,040
um within your region so you know you

222
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,180
know you have you have to find the right

223
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:05,099
lawyers you have to find the right

224
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:07,559
Consultants you have to partner with the

225
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,540
right people and even like like I

226
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:12,299
pointed out before you figure out what

227
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:13,919
problems you're trying to solve you guys

228
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:16,259
are saying okay I've got a product here

229
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,958
I've got you know shatter I've got I've

230
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:20,338
got a flower I've got this what's the

231
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,778
problem that you're you're trying to

232
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,120
solve well we want to make sure that

233
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:25,500
we're giving clean medical cannabis to

234
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,200
people

235
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,360
um uh GMP is a big part of that and

236
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,580
gmp's got a lot of parts that you know

237
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,000
the iqoq and then you have the PQ you

238
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:39,500
know the PQ requirements are are very

239
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,759
are very um stringent in some parts but

240
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,799
it's got to be a part of your process

241
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,000
that you're solving a problem and that

242
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:49,338
you're understanding what the local

243
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,339
regulations are with your partners

244
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,639
I'll jump in

245
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,139
yesterday many of the panelists up here

246
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,480
I kept on hearing the word collaboration

247
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,819
collaboration with your regulators and

248
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,080
there's a lot of maybe anger towards The

249
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,000
Regulators you think they're trying to

250
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,680
make your life difficult you know

251
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
they're trying to figure it out too just

252
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,859
like we are

253
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,839
and they're trying to do the best they

254
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,820
can and

255
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,959
you know we have found that you know

256
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,778
working with the collaborative The

257
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:21,000
Regulators is collaboratively really

258
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:22,679
yields great results

259
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,539
tangling with your Regulators is a

260
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:25,679
recipe for disaster it's like being a

261
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:27,719
little warm and jumping in the Shark

262
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,059
Tank to cool off it's not going to turn

263
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,980
out well for you so I would Advocate

264
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:34,679
make them your friends work with them

265
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,720
and they'll serve you well

266
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:39,239
I mean to Arthur's point when I was in

267
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,459
one of the sessions yesterday like he

268
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,139
said everyone kept saying become friends

269
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,879
with your Regulators understand what

270
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:47,338
they want do not be afraid of them

271
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:50,399
really like have a relationship with

272
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:53,160
them and I can't stress that more

273
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,078
um because we've seen that happen you

274
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:56,338
know here in the states and especially

275
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:58,919
in the states I think a lot of

276
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:00,480
cultivators are terrified of The

277
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:02,338
Regulators they don't know how to

278
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,220
embrace it I think there's a lot of

279
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:07,320
bitterness about the testing regulations

280
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:10,860
that have come down the requirements

281
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,600
that they're subjected to and so they've

282
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,659
really shunned the regulations but

283
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,459
Regulators are writing this Playbook as

284
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:19,559
we you know move forward every day I

285
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:22,078
mean there's been nothing done in this

286
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:24,539
regard before so I've I've always

287
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,458
embraced the regulation side I think

288
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:29,519
that's helped our company but also

289
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:30,719
really helped our partner so yes Embrace

290
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,139
that for sure

291
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,360
so when usually when lawyers are brought

292
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:39,059
in the conversation it gets scary

293
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,180
there's it feels like it's about to get

294
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:43,979
contentious so to the point of playing

295
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:46,199
nice with Regulators because they're

296
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,120
they're people too and they're trying to

297
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,800
do the right things so you know don't

298
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,778
insult them and try to steamroll them

299
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,759
but uh what are your thoughts on

300
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:55,860
retaining legal counsel and if you've

301
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,019
done that do you have advice on doing so

302
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,839
and choosing counsel that can just

303
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:04,078
counsel you to navigate

304
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:06,600
and steer clear of

305
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:10,139
um being steered to some some choppy

306
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,480
Waters in any way because you know

307
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:14,879
I think in litigation only the lawyers

308
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,839
win but you need some legal counsel to

309
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:17,838
navigate some of these things

310
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:26,660
George that's on you oh well I've got an

311
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:29,879
excellent lawyer I mean

312
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:32,399
but you know I can't read you know 400

313
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:35,039
pages in German of regulation for what

314
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,720
the German pharmacobia you know so you

315
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,699
got to have somebody who knows what

316
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,860
they're doing in the country in the

317
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,740
country that you're trying to operate

318
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,839
um and and any even larger uh broadly

319
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,000
across the EU so you know putting

320
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,480
together the right German team as far as

321
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,879
the the lawyers in the U.S

322
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,220
uh and I agree with what Arthur said as

323
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:58,860
well you know don't challenge these

324
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:02,399
people I sued a state in the U.S and

325
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:04,680
they came after me with like we won but

326
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,720
they they came after me like uh with a

327
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:08,759
Vengeance so you know work with these

328
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,500
people the best you can

329
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:12,679
um remember you're solving a problem for

330
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,679
them

331
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,399
we brought in a government Affairs team

332
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:20,338
to help us navigate the regulatory

333
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,259
landscape but also to you know get to

334
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:24,540
understand like what The Regulators want

335
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:26,220
what do they need you know what are the

336
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:28,740
pathways they need to understand to help

337
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,778
move this industry forward and it's been

338
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,360
I mean it's been incredibly successful

339
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:36,059
for us but also that is certainly what

340
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,919
we refer to our partners as well is

341
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:40,859
bring in the government Affairs bring in

342
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,199
lawyers to help you to help guide you in

343
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,680
this like choppy Waters because it

344
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:50,339
doesn't get easier that's for sure

345
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:52,620
R3 you want to add nope no comment no

346
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:55,200
comment okay this is being recorded so

347
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:59,578
that might be a good idea

348
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:02,759
so you so years building this Niche I

349
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:04,458
mean really Kudos thanks for the hard

350
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,819
work all of you

351
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:12,359
uh you know jousting with legislators

352
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:15,440
Regulators politicians all the sorts I

353
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,759
mean you must have stories for days any

354
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,100
anecdotes you're willing to share here

355
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:23,419
publicly Arthur since you passed on the

356
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,420
last yeah I'll pass okay

357
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,360
we've seen a lot

358
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,399
and

359
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,320
one story that comes to mind

360
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:35,519
it's in Colorado

361
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,480
and go back to 2015 Colorado was the

362
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,419
first

363
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,159
U.S state to go adult use they had no

364
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:42,360
regulatory framework they had no way to

365
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,600
enforce it

366
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,940
so the marijuana enforcement

367
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,278
Department Med

368
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,839
tap the drug enforcement agency of the

369
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:54,360
state of Colorado they said we're going

370
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:58,199
to bring you in to regulate this in the

371
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,120
D.A officers raise their eyebrows aghast

372
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:01,740
and they said no way

373
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,078
we've been trying to put these people in

374
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,680
jail for decades and now you want us to

375
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:09,359
empower them to make them successful

376
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:10,379
forget it go find somebody else to do

377
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,778
this

378
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:14,820
out of that came inadvertently the

379
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:17,698
creation of the Cannabis Testing Lab

380
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:21,079
industry which is a big

381
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:23,578
big dollar you know industry right now

382
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:26,399
and when

383
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:28,138
Nevada was looking to start their adult

384
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,360
wreck

385
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:32,820
Market they looked at Best Practices in

386
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,339
Colorado so they copied them

387
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,540
and then Michigan copied Colorado and

388
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:39,300
Nevada

389
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:41,399
and 23 States later

390
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:44,399
all these states have the same

391
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:47,339
regulatory framework really begun just

392
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,440
by one DEA agent saying I'm not going to

393
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:52,820
do it so it was not very thought through

394
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,820
but that's where we are today

395
00:15:55,019 --> 00:16:00,600
anyone want to try to top that

396
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,820
I don't know that's kind of hard I mean

397
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,579
from my perspective and from my

398
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,980
company's perspective I mean we were in

399
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:09,299
the cultivations all the time so you

400
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,339
know the horrible things that you think

401
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:13,078
you've seen you you know you kind of top

402
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:15,660
that at the next cultivation you go to

403
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:17,519
especially early days I mean you know we

404
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:18,600
see dogs running around grows and they

405
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,379
wonder why they're failing for

406
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:24,959
microbials or um you know we saw a

407
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:26,578
company trying to make bubble hash in a

408
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,919
uh

409
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:31,559
a washer machine

410
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:34,078
um so I mean it just the like one

411
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:37,018
customer we had they had chickens and

412
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:39,239
Ducks running around their farm and I

413
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:42,000
mean their flower was covered in E coli

414
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,159
and salmonella I mean it's like they

415
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,559
people do not understand that this is a

416
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,958
product that you're going to consume and

417
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:51,000
do you see in the Frito-Lay facility you

418
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,458
know dogs running around and people not

419
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,899
wearing PPE or or wearing the gloves and

420
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:57,119
then eating a bag of Cheetos and then

421
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:58,799
going back and like continuing to trim

422
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,740
the flour I mean this is an absurdity

423
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:03,838
that we see in the U.S and so it's

424
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,000
really encouraging that I feel like the

425
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,220
European Market has really avoided that

426
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,039
because they put very strict guidelines

427
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,539
in place from the very beginning and you

428
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,178
know I'll be damned if I saw a dog

429
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:16,558
probably running around grow in Europe

430
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:19,319
so

431
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:21,899
um I mean the stories are endless but

432
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:24,000
it's been encouraging to see the the

433
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,100
progression and that new cultivations

434
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,140
opening up really care they care about

435
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:30,599
consumers safety they care about quality

436
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:33,960
product and so you know I'm excited to

437
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:36,480
see how the industry keeps evolving

438
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,120
and I've got a a little different

439
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,038
perspective you know after years or

440
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:43,859
years of doing this you go to people and

441
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:45,599
you say Hey you know we'd like to talk

442
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:49,139
to you about decontamination oh don't

443
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,819
worry we we grow clean we we're fine we

444
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,440
don't need any of that and then what

445
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:55,079
three months later hey

446
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,900
remember when you were here we think we

447
00:17:55,079 --> 00:18:02,220
need one of those units so out there

448
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:04,620
there's a a false

449
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,419
hope that that that there's going to be

450
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:08,579
clean grow and that's what you want uh

451
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,900
you want to have clean cannabis you know

452
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:11,399
that's grown clean there's a lot of

453
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,160
products out there that help that during

454
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,720
the grow But ultimately you know

455
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,340
contaminants are everywhere they're

456
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,679
floating around this room and you're

457
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:21,659
going to need one of us in order to make

458
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,120
it safe for people and it's not that

459
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,480
you've failed it's just a part of the

460
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:28,558
way that the world is there's

461
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,538
contaminants everywhere they're in the

462
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,519
air they're in the soil uh they're on

463
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:34,440
the dogs that are running around and

464
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:37,319
just you know when you're going through

465
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,840
a grow you know you want to make sure

466
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:41,819
that it's it's all for Public Safety so

467
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,279
you know whether whatever you can't

468
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:47,519
decontamination method you choose

469
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:48,839
you know don't think that

470
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:50,460
you're going to be perfectly perfect

471
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:52,199
because we pull stuff off the shelf all

472
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:56,100
the time we do Secret shopping ourselves

473
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,779
and things that that have cleared months

474
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:59,759
ago they're not they're not clear

475
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:02,819
anymore so

476
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,619
um you know always keep have a backup

477
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:06,480
plan especially the investors you know

478
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:09,479
that hey if I'm not going to get this

479
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,220
flower for for a dollar I'm going to get

480
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,839
20 cents on the dollar if I send it to

481
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,839
extract so have a plan

482
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:19,798
I want to just add to that Jill has

483
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,140
really gotten out front and changing the

484
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:23,879
conversation in the United States as

485
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,340
George just referenced there's there's

486
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,840
been a stigma that and every cultivator

487
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:29,939
thinks it's planned for its own children

488
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:33,298
you know my children are perfect

489
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:36,000
well they're not perfect 20 plus minus

490
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:39,839
are going to fail microbial

491
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,058
so the conversation shifting from

492
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,980
I don't have a problem I do have a

493
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:45,720
problem then the CFO comes in and says

494
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,700
I'm no longer going to allow you to sell

495
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,940
that to extract at a deep discount

496
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:53,100
within you know throw it over the wall

497
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:56,340
but they still want don't want to do a

498
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:59,099
kill step up front and Jill really got

499
00:19:56,339 --> 00:20:01,019
out in front advocating this that hey we

500
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:03,719
have to change the conversation

501
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:05,579
a kill step is the right thing to do

502
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,038
doesn't mean that your product is bad

503
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:09,720
it's in the consumer's interests

504
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:12,179
to do this and it's also in the

505
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,558
financial interests of the company to

506
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:15,559
create higher yield product

507
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,939
so

508
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:22,918
as Devil's Advocate because I'm sure

509
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,538
you've heard this enough times to be

510
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,160
prepared is just

511
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:28,740
you're talking to someone who says well

512
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,960
I've been consuming for years and

513
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,579
decades I've consumed all of these

514
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,798
things are cleaning I'm still here I'm

515
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:38,058
okay I'm alive why not just keep going

516
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:40,500
that way well that yeah

517
00:20:38,058 --> 00:20:41,779
let's kick it off with well do you have

518
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,859
cancer or do you are you

519
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:46,019
immunocompromised or you know these are

520
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:47,819
medical patients as well it's not just

521
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:49,798
the recreational patient and you know

522
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:52,200
I'm pretty sure a lot of people have

523
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:53,460
deep ties to this but you can't have a

524
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,220
medical patient that gets something

525
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,720
that's got aspergillus in it and uh and

526
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,279
expect that person to be well there's

527
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,380
documented cases all throughout

528
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,538
especially the US on people that get

529
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,740
sick from the camp from contaminated

530
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:05,900
cannabis

531
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,400
sorry

532
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,919
oh I mean I was gonna say the same thing

533
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,660
I mean we're selling to a totally

534
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:14,820
different consumer it's not just you and

535
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:17,580
your Bros smoking weed in the back of a

536
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:18,839
car it is a mom that's trying cannabis

537
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:21,298
for the first time or it's

538
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:23,579
immunocompromised or you know some

539
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:25,918
medical patient that really needs high

540
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:29,158
quality cannabis so it is unacceptable

541
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:32,700
if a cultivation thinks that they don't

542
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:35,100
need a processes to ensure that this

543
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,919
product is as clean and high quality as

544
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:40,199
it could be like that conversation I I

545
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,360
can't even with it anymore when people

546
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,159
say that to me I was like oh my god I've

547
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:46,619
been smoking weed forever and I'm fine

548
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,600
but are you because there could be like

549
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:50,399
indications that you aren't fine or you

550
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,619
have stomach issues and and that might

551
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,659
be there's a whole Suite of things that

552
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:56,399
could be happening if you're smoking or

553
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:58,980
consuming contaminated cannabis that you

554
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,440
don't even put those two together so

555
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,779
um no we need to we need to step up the

556
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,980
quality but in in I mostly I speak to

557
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:08,099
the states

558
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:10,679
not really the European market

559
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:12,599
so I mean so

560
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:14,880
LinkedIn is very cannabis friendly

561
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:16,980
thankfully so but maybe everyone here

562
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,620
has seen it but it I wonder how

563
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,319
surprising it might be to people here to

564
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:26,099
hear that there are grows there are

565
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:29,579
legal grows with animals running around

566
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:32,279
still that's a thing you know you're

567
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:34,079
California Sun grown

568
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:36,658
um it's just out in the open it's all

569
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:39,779
natural dogs are our friends who cares

570
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:42,240
that's these are yeah that's real things

571
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:43,500
it's wild

572
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,179
I think we have time for audience

573
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,859
questions

574
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:48,860
great yes sir

575
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:53,959
I'm here

576
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,700
okay thank you

577
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:02,879
my name is Rocky petrulo we have a

578
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:06,000
company in Columbia growing however I

579
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,980
got a question and a comment for Jill

580
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,659
Jill you mentioned ozone and that you're

581
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,740
decontaminating the uh the flower

582
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:16,320
correct

583
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,659
so when you apply the ozone I was in the

584
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:20,700
biohazardous industry for a long time

585
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:23,280
and I was a I've been a regulator for a

586
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,679
decade and then I was a stakeholder and

587
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:28,980
built a medical waste treatment plant

588
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:32,340
for 10 years so I caught I have both

589
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:34,500
sides of it but we used autoclaves to

590
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:36,538
steam sterilize biohazardous waste but

591
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,538
then it goes through the trash it goes

592
00:23:36,538 --> 00:23:44,038
to the landfill what when you ozone the

593
00:23:39,538 --> 00:23:47,700
flower is it reusable or is it destroyed

594
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:50,279
post so after we treat it with ozone can

595
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,659
it be used as can it go to the Shelf as

596
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:53,460
flower

597
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:54,659
is that what you mean does it go to the

598
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,980
Shelf as flower

599
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:58,380
yes

600
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,120
yes that yes that is definitely the

601
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,280
intention I mean there are certain

602
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:04,199
levels of contamination that ozone does

603
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:07,500
not get clean because ozone is a Surface

604
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,900
decontamination but our system is built

605
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:13,019
around you know specific treatment times

606
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:16,140
in relation to Ozone concentration it's

607
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:18,440
fully contained so yes the flower is fit

608
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,440
for use

609
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,240
another question

610
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:35,339
yes hi thanks

611
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,440
um I got a question uh regarding

612
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:40,199
um because you were talking about a lot

613
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,140
of regional National and even local

614
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,759
different regulations now if you I'm

615
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,380
from the pharmaceutical industry I've

616
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:48,480
got a pharmaceutical background in here

617
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:51,780
there are a lot of efforts for

618
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,000
harmonization even globally so now when

619
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:56,819
it comes to cannabis first thing we got

620
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,919
now at the moment is the monograph in

621
00:24:56,819 --> 00:25:01,798
the European pharmacopoeia which is

622
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:05,460
going to be introduced quite soon I

623
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:08,279
guess do you see any more efforts or

624
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:10,980
developments uh

625
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:13,678
into a more harmonized and

626
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:16,259
internationally harmonized

627
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:20,220
um regulatory landscape even maybe a

628
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:23,519
kind of ich for cannabis or will the ich

629
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:27,240
even take over cannabis or will it be as

630
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:29,038
it is for for long to come

631
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,558
get a lot of time

632
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:34,319
um because I think every like Italy you

633
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:35,460
know Spain Portugal Germany I think a

634
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,500
lot of people are probably looking to

635
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:39,720
see what Germany's doing

636
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,819
um and then they'll they might copy

637
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,919
parts of that you know across the the

638
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:45,240
pharmacopia and the amrap V and stuff

639
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,400
like that but

640
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,140
um you know the the requirements in

641
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,360
Germany are pretty stringent

642
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,860
and remember these other countries are

643
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:56,038
going to look for what's best for the

644
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:59,219
consumer right so they might take parts

645
00:25:56,038 --> 00:26:01,558
of what's good for uh for the consumer

646
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,278
from Germany but the second part of that

647
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:03,839
is

648
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:06,119
then when you get to the regional and

649
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,798
the local it's going to be tax money you

650
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:10,319
know how much are they going to make tax

651
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:12,240
you know because uh you know believe it

652
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,700
or not the government likes to make

653
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,298
money off this as well so did that

654
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,298
answer the question

655
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:25,558
yeah hi hello

656
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:29,179
um talking about the contamination

657
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:31,678
um can you comment about

658
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:34,919
because some of the countries at least

659
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:37,340
it's what I have heard has some issues

660
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:41,340
regarding radiation

661
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:44,278
if it's not a regular regulation issue

662
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:46,319
it could be a consumer issue or even

663
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:48,200
customers that say they will not accept

664
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:51,538
product that was

665
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,740
going to irradiation because if it's bad

666
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:55,640
quality

667
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:59,278
so can you comment a little bit on that

668
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:04,080
what you think about irradiation has

669
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:07,019
linked with not has good product

670
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:10,019
so the irradiation question there's a

671
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:11,579
span all the way from RF up to gamma so

672
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:15,298
radiation is the lights that you're

673
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:17,639
seeing now it's UV high power gamma and

674
00:27:15,298 --> 00:27:20,700
e-beam are what they're used regularly

675
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,320
in the EU and also in Canada so those

676
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,659
you know there's studies that are out on

677
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,759
that it's it's safe they use it for

678
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:28,500
medical devices when I was a striker

679
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:30,599
that all the knee implants all the

680
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,000
stints everything gets irradiated right

681
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:35,639
so there's some

682
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,440
there's a a trail a trail of people out

683
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,659
there that think that radiation is bad

684
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,460
but it's not it's it's proven safe it's

685
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:43,080
generally regarded as safe all

686
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,179
prescription drugs in the US are

687
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:46,379
irradiated and they and they don't have

688
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:47,700
to be labeled either because they're

689
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,320
generally regarded as safe the

690
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,120
government's got done away with that so

691
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:53,519
you know just

692
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,199
understand the conversation understand

693
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,720
the motivation of the people that are

694
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,880
saying stuff like that but it's it's uh

695
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,500
it's not a it's something that that

696
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,900
keeps the world clean you know there's

697
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,859
different methods ozone you know

698
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,860
peroxide

699
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:13,259
RF but there's different methods of of

700
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:15,839
decontamination across the world but you

701
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:17,038
know you know they're all you know they

702
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:18,959
wouldn't be out there if they weren't

703
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:20,720
safe

704
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,640
thank you

705
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,319
I think that's all the time we have

706
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,520
that was fantastic let's hear it once

707
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:28,519
again for this wonderful panel
