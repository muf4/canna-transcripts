1
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:09,080
the California Bureau of cannabis

2
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:16,189
control Laurie Ajax that's here for

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:18,230
everybody there you go good morning

4
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:19,849
everybody this is gonna be kind of a

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,500
unique experience for me because I get

6
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:23,210
to sit next to a regulator without

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,618
wanting to shake some sense into them

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,618
so it should be kind of a fun

9
00:00:24,618 --> 00:00:29,929
conversation just before we start I want

10
00:00:27,618 --> 00:00:31,640
to kind of cover a very brief history

11
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:34,280
because those of you that know me know

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,549
I'm a nerd that way of both California

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,039
and Vancouver and BC in particular they

14
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:41,869
share a very long parallel history they

15
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:43,879
were both hubs during the gold rush

16
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:45,439
they both housed a lot of X railroad

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,350
workers they were both involved with the

18
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:50,238
opium war and they also contributed a

19
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,060
lot to cannabis both individually and

20
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:55,399
together starting in the counterculture

21
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:58,190
movements in the 60s we saw a lot of

22
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,769
draft dodgers come up to Vancouver and

23
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:03,579
BC which did actually revitalize our

24
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:07,359
cannabis community up here but it also

25
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:10,489
created an interesting situation where

26
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:13,129
one of those draft dodgers met a

27
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:15,349
descendant of a Chinese man who had come

28
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:16,908
over here during the opium wars and they

29
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:19,428
formed one of the most potent pairs in

30
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:21,139
cannabis cannabis Cheech and Chong so

31
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:24,170
that was one of the first sort of

32
00:01:21,138 --> 00:01:27,888
partnerships that BC and California

33
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,689
shared in 1991 a man named Thomas

34
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:32,539
O'Malley opened the first compassion

35
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:36,078
Club the first cannabis dispensary in

36
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:37,549
the world for at least 50 60 years and

37
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,858
he inspired a bunch of cannabis

38
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:41,719
communities up here to also start

39
00:01:39,858 --> 00:01:43,728
compassion clubs the VC compassion Club

40
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:47,419
Society Victoria cannabis eyelid

41
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:49,989
Beiler's Club and Toronto compassion

42
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,609
Club calm and a few in Toronto as well

43
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:56,028
so they shared very similar histories

44
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:58,759
until fairly recently now of course in

45
00:01:56,028 --> 00:02:01,668
Vancouver we have federal regulation

46
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,560
which has meant that BC doesn't really

47
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:05,929
get a chance to kind of regulate its own

48
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,998
industry whereas in California the US

49
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:10,009
federal government is not so much for it

50
00:02:07,998 --> 00:02:11,719
which leaves California free to at least

51
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:14,628
kind of regulate their own local state

52
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:16,639
industry some of the other issues that

53
00:02:14,628 --> 00:02:19,789
we've been having that are both parallel

54
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,919
is that the focus on adult use market or

55
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:24,019
the recreational market has really sort

56
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,089
of left Medical dispensaries as sort of

57
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,189
a side issue that people aren't really

58
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:31,340
interested in talking about right now it

59
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:32,659
keeps being kind of put off so Lori

60
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,340
that's my first question for you is

61
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:36,979
where is California in terms of their

62
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,450
medical program well first of all thank

63
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:40,879
you very much for having me here in

64
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:43,429
Canada it's just an honor to be here and

65
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,430
as much as she may want to shake a

66
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:50,599
regulator I'll put myself over you can

67
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:52,430
shake me thing we weird they're just so

68
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:54,259
much to learn here I just find it

69
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,480
fascinating what's going on here in

70
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:59,899
Canada but when you look at like the

71
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:03,019
medical market in California I think you

72
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,360
know we're also seeing it shrinking just

73
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:08,810
from the sheer fact of how we regulate

74
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,660
it now at early on in 2018 we used to

75
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:14,239
require licensees if you wanted to do

76
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:17,090
adult use and medical use you had to get

77
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,709
separate licenses to do it so you'd have

78
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,560
to come in and get your medical license

79
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:24,680
to self to medical patients and then

80
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,469
adult use license to sell to consumers

81
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,939
and that really wasn't working well

82
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:30,919
that's probably when the industry

83
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:32,750
brought it really was like it really

84
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,280
this doesn't make a lot of sense we're

85
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,769
getting two licenses for the same

86
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,140
premises we're having two your basically

87
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:41,959
filling out the same application so

88
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:44,839
within about six months of 2018 we

89
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,780
change that and we have one license and

90
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,759
then the license is designated adult use

91
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,949
or medical use and that's really

92
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,590
determined by the local jurisdiction

93
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:56,810
because California in order for the

94
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:59,209
state to issue any sort of commercial

95
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:01,640
cannabis license it has to be approved

96
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:05,120
by the local jurisdiction and at

97
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:07,669
California's very large so that's over

98
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,640
500 different local jurisdictions across

99
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:12,079
the state so they that's determined so

100
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,599
we still have jurisdictions that just

101
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,699
allow medical some allow both but I

102
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:19,790
think what we're seeing is is for the

103
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:23,659
average patient it's a lot easier just

104
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:25,760
to go in and get you know by it you know

105
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,220
as adult use because they don't have to

106
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,319
get a recommendation

107
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,970
it's you know that that costs money they

108
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:34,540
don't have to get a medical marijuana

109
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:36,880
card and so I think you're finding more

110
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,670
consumers are just skipping that part of

111
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:42,100
it the other thing we've been looking at

112
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:44,650
though is access because you know we

113
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,629
still have a lot of jurisdictions in

114
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:49,289
California that don't allow commercial

115
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:53,379
cannabis activity I think we're just

116
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:55,090
about two-thirds still so for our

117
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:57,040
medical patients there are some areas

118
00:04:55,089 --> 00:05:01,089
that's very difficult for them to get

119
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,800
legal access to cannabis so one of our

120
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:05,739
regulations does allow if you're

121
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,590
licensed to deliver in California you

122
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:11,530
can deliver anywhere in the state and

123
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:15,939
that has created some controversy in

124
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:19,769
California for us what happened there

125
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:21,850
whoa hello oh I think that's working

126
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:24,609
yeah that was one of the things that I

127
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,140
wanted to talk about a lot unfortunately

128
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,050
Laurie can't talk about it that much

129
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:31,659
because the state really did go to bat

130
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:34,180
for delivery services and they're being

131
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,040
sued by cities now to not allow delivery

132
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,410
services which is why she can't talk

133
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,120
about it as much as she'd like to also

134
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,290
one of the reasons why I was kind of sad

135
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,079
when I heard that because it was like

136
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,879
that's a really that that sort of sets

137
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,279
you apart from most of other regulators

138
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,959
up here our regulators appear very happy

139
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:51,668
to forget about medical the situation

140
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:54,399
that you're describing is almost sort of

141
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:56,769
wished for where they can just shunt

142
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,739
medical patients to the adult system and

143
00:05:56,769 --> 00:06:02,379
then they don't track it and you know it

144
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:06,310
it becomes easier to forget the cannabis

145
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:09,129
as medicine again right so with that in

146
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:11,110
terms of where it's at for medical what

147
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:14,740
is going on with just the strict this

148
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:17,650
strictly adult use side well again with

149
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:20,350
you know we're looking at about 6,000

150
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:23,009
license I think around 6500 licenses

151
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:28,060
across the state across the supply chain

152
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:30,279
so we are seeing you know a lot of areas

153
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,978
that still don't have licensing so in

154
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:34,750
those areas it's you know we we want to

155
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:37,629
make sure that people have a legal

156
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:40,449
access to get cannabis but you are

157
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:41,019
seeing people go to the adult use market

158
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:44,649
go to lie

159
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:46,689
since retailers they want the different

160
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:48,969
brands and varieties that you can get

161
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:52,389
from licensed retailers but I think what

162
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:54,819
we're looking at right now is Believe It

163
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:56,228
or Not when you look at distribution

164
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:57,908
versus retailer we have more

165
00:06:56,228 --> 00:07:00,788
distributors right now than we do

166
00:06:57,908 --> 00:07:03,310
retailers and so I think for us we're

167
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:06,610
hoping we can get more jurisdictions to

168
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:09,129
allow retail sales because I think for

169
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,569
consumers you want competition you want

170
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:14,949
you know again you don't want to drive

171
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:17,379
two hours to get legal cannabis so so a

172
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:19,000
lot of work to do on that front and

173
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:20,019
working with the local jurisdictions

174
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,668
yeah and that involves different

175
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:23,620
jurisdictions because sometimes it's the

176
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:26,918
city sometimes it's the county correct

177
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:28,180
correct yeah it's fun what I said I

178
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:30,430
wasn't gonna put you on the spot but

179
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,110
what other governmental agencies are

180
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,689
getting involved like so for example

181
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,879
here in BC the agricultural land

182
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:38,500
Commission decided that that they were

183
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,500
gonna have a chance to kind of express

184
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,418
an opinion on stuff we've got Metro

185
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,829
Vancouver that's trying to put limits on

186
00:07:43,418 --> 00:07:46,568
growing there's like all of these other

187
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:50,258
areas of government that are also trying

188
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:52,598
to step in yeah our our statute actually

189
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:55,150
sets up I mean we you know we didn't do

190
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:57,310
anything easy in California we have a

191
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:58,899
lot of different state agencies involved

192
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,538
so not only do you have the local

193
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:04,478
control issue you have three different

194
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:06,519
licensing authorities the the agency I

195
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:09,339
oversee the Bureau of cannabis control

196
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:11,769
is the lead agency but when it comes to

197
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:13,689
issuing cultivation licenses we have the

198
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:15,818
Department of Food and Agriculture for

199
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:18,278
manufacturing the Department of Public

200
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:20,020
Health issues those licenses if your

201
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:22,149
cultivator you also have to get your

202
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:24,189
water permit you got to get a pin rent

203
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:26,408
with Fish and Wildlife and then you deal

204
00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:27,819
with for your seller's permit on taxes

205
00:08:26,408 --> 00:08:30,968
you have to deal with the taxing

206
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:34,120
agencies so a lot of intersection with a

207
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:35,860
lot of different state agency which you

208
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,769
know especially when you're looking at a

209
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,629
market that was really in California a

210
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:42,549
medical market that really wasn't it

211
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:44,559
wasn't regulated by the state and at

212
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:46,870
some point maybe some regulation at the

213
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,969
local level but trying to get all those

214
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,429
folks in and then say hey by the way you

215
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,790
got to deal with you know five different

216
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:55,729
agency it's

217
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:58,399
it's a it can be daunting for anybody

218
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:00,440
you know and and then again it's like

219
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,449
you know here is the government we want

220
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,190
all this information from you we want

221
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,379
you to keep records which you know

222
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,240
typically that's probably what you

223
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,830
didn't want to do you know prior to

224
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,820
regulate sort of something the

225
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:16,850
government encouraged you not to do so

226
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:19,430
it's interesting and and for sure

227
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,170
challenging and I think you know for any

228
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:23,839
regulator you know maybe we have a

229
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:25,819
tendency to probably be you know we you

230
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,740
know over regulate at times are a little

231
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,020
conservative but a lot of times it's

232
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,940
because we don't have a lot of

233
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:33,470
information when we started out in this

234
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,680
journey a three and a half years ago

235
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:38,660
with first setting up medical statutory

236
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:41,539
framework and then adult use it's like

237
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:42,860
you're you're doing you know and not

238
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,449
that you want to hear this but you know

239
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,430
you just didn't have a lot to look we

240
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,650
had you know Colorado look at in

241
00:09:46,429 --> 00:09:51,079
Washington but really for California

242
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:53,389
it's so unique and a lot of times as a

243
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,250
regulator you just you you put something

244
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:57,169
out there and you know sometimes it

245
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:59,809
works sometimes it doesn't but I will

246
00:09:57,169 --> 00:10:01,669
say in California when you look at all

247
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:03,559
the folks regulating I mean the one

248
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:05,839
thing I will say is we we want to

249
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:08,449
continue to engage with the industry and

250
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:11,030
we do make changes when things don't

251
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:15,590
work we make changes and we try to do it

252
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:17,419
fairly quickly because we know for for a

253
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:19,460
lot of you that are in the legal market

254
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:22,009
no matter where you are it's a struggle

255
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:24,350
and if the regulators aren't listening

256
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:25,879
and we aren't seeing like hey you know

257
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,550
what as long as it's not going to

258
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:30,799
compromise public safety it's up to us

259
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:32,870
to really continue to engage you and

260
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:37,399
make sure that we're making those

261
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:39,950
changes so you can thrive question

262
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:43,759
around consumption so some cities like

263
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:47,660
San Francisco allow consumption on like

264
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:49,850
retail type premises or lounge areas how

265
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:52,459
is California deal with you know up in

266
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:54,889
Canada of course that stuff is actually

267
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,750
regulated provincially but usually they

268
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:58,639
just kind of sweep it under the key

269
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,470
tobacco smoking act and just kind of

270
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:01,439
leave it alone so how does California

271
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,240
handle that

272
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,329
so California for the most part

273
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,399
consumption on retail premises it has to

274
00:11:06,328 --> 00:11:10,138
be approved at the local level so most

275
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,818
of that's pushed down for the local

276
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:14,579
jurisdiction to determine whether or not

277
00:11:11,818 --> 00:11:16,849
they want consumption right now it's

278
00:11:14,578 --> 00:11:19,649
just that it can only happen at retail

279
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:21,689
premises and I think you know but we're

280
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:23,399
starting to see you know places at well

281
00:11:21,688 --> 00:11:25,289
we don't want to sell cannabis but we

282
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,078
just want to have a place where people

283
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:30,599
can bring their cannabis and consume and

284
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,979
I think we're right now trying to deal

285
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,050
with that and what does that look like

286
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,060
do you need to be licensed do you not

287
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:37,740
need to be licensed so those are the

288
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:39,000
some things we're dealing with and and

289
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,100
we're dealing with some issues with

290
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,409
cities that they want to have more than

291
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,930
just consumption they want to also you

292
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:48,360
know serve other items like coffee and

293
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:50,638
you know you know food and things like

294
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,740
that so those are the things that we're

295
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,899
gonna be looking at really closely over

296
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,789
the next few months is you know how do

297
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:59,429
you normalize it because you know you

298
00:11:56,789 --> 00:12:01,769
know for most of us if you don't consume

299
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:03,448
cannabis but maybe you have friends that

300
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:05,759
do you want to be able to go to places

301
00:12:03,448 --> 00:12:07,979
where you know your friend can consume

302
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,740
cannabis and maybe you can have a you

303
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,839
know a coffee or whatever and so I think

304
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,299
I think we're gonna see more of that

305
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:18,600
coming especially with all the tourism

306
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:20,429
we have in California so well I think I

307
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,170
think it's time we evolved I mean it

308
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:24,059
seems like I'm gonna tell you it's been

309
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:25,679
a year and a half like you're in seven

310
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:27,688
months in California and it feels like

311
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,208
it's been so much longer and we're like

312
00:12:27,688 --> 00:12:31,938
hey let's evolve and and but but it's

313
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:34,469
true you guys you guys move at

314
00:12:31,938 --> 00:12:36,599
lightning-fast speed and you know you

315
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,250
just sort of drag us along with you so

316
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,490
well at least you're willing to be

317
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,360
drugged not all regulators are one of

318
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,129
the favorite things you know you

319
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,360
mentioned normalization and that's been

320
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:46,740
one of the favorite things I've seen out

321
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,230
of California so far there was a

322
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,610
campaign awhile ago I don't remember who

323
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:53,490
was responsible for it but it was

324
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:54,990
showing like Rockwell type family images

325
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,480
and over in the corner there just be an

326
00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:00,899
ashtray with a joint in it and it was

327
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:03,329
really subtle and really nice to see you

328
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:05,458
guys have launched weed wise hashtag

329
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:08,338
weed wise can you tell us a little bit

330
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:10,558
about that program yeah so you know as

331
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,420
most of you know we've we've got a lot

332
00:13:10,558 --> 00:13:14,459
of challenges in California and

333
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:16,439
especially the illegal

334
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:21,600
market right and the unlicensed market

335
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,980
and making sure people understand you

336
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,159
want to always you know we're always

337
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,240
looking to issue licenses and then

338
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:29,100
aggressively attack the unlicensed

339
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,470
market but we always felt there needed

340
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,320
to be an educational component to that

341
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:37,920
so we lost a launched a public awareness

342
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,620
campaign back in June called hashtag

343
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,649
weed wise and it really has two goals

344
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,730
one it's to let the unlicensed market

345
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:47,069
know that if you're conducting

346
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:48,870
commercial cannabis activity you have to

347
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:51,210
have a license and you need to get

348
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:53,549
licensed otherwise you're gonna get shut

349
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:56,370
down so that's that's one part of it and

350
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:58,979
the second part is really educating the

351
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:01,679
consumers on why it's important they go

352
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,200
to a licensed retail shop so you know

353
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,479
it's great that we license everybody but

354
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,520
if an average consumer doesn't know

355
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,670
whether they're walking into a legal

356
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:14,069
shop or not we've only we haven't done

357
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:16,439
art we haven't done our job right we

358
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,879
need to just because we talk about you

359
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,100
know I don't I think we all talk about

360
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:22,169
this probably 24/7 but your average

361
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,060
consumer doesn't know when they walk

362
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:26,729
into a retail shop is this license is

363
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:28,709
this unlicensed and why it's important

364
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,990
that they're probably paying more than

365
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:32,940
they are on the illegal market why it is

366
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,279
that you know telling them we're testing

367
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,830
it you're gonna get safe cannabis and so

368
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,649
it's been it's been really interesting

369
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:43,020
so we just launched a license we know we

370
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:45,419
had our regular license search and but

371
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:47,819
we've launched in it's called see a pot

372
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:50,159
check comm and we've been really pushing

373
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,810
that out there so people can check if

374
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:53,579
they're walking into a store they can

375
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:56,159
check to see if or not they have a

376
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:59,220
license and stuff so really some

377
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:02,789
exciting stuff going on with that and I

378
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:05,340
always say I I don't I don't think in my

379
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:06,750
entire state career I'd ever think that

380
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:09,629
the state of California would have a

381
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,820
website called see a pot check com but

382
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:14,159
here we are isn't it's great actually

383
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,170
well and you also ran public service

384
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,360
announcements starring Cheech Marin as a

385
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:19,829
government regulator who would answer

386
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,039
your questions if you wanted to get

387
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:25,139
licensed you know one of the issues that

388
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,949
we've been having up here is that our

389
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:29,409
existing illegal market

390
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:32,140
is actually higher-quality by most

391
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:34,350
standards than our regulated market and

392
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:37,720
they've got a lot more customer loyalty

393
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:39,519
there's barriers around testing for sure

394
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,810
because some of them do get it tested

395
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,159
but they can't really tell you that they

396
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,509
got it tested because the lab doesn't

397
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:45,549
want to say that they've been testing

398
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:47,230
the legal cannabis and California is

399
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:49,779
also in a very similar situation where

400
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:52,300
you've got some areas that have a lot of

401
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:54,970
experience with cannabis very

402
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:56,439
knowledgeable consumers and a highly

403
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,629
developed market and then you've got

404
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:02,860
other areas that the markets probably

405
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:04,840
not quite as developed so what would you

406
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:07,480
say are the barriers for currently

407
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,100
illicit retailers for example to get

408
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,830
licensed

409
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,090
well I and most of it is their local

410
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,009
jurisdiction maybe where they've been

411
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:18,160
operating for a long time is not

412
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:20,529
allowing a commercial cannabis so that's

413
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,750
that's a big barrier and then finding a

414
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:25,569
city or county that is going to allow it

415
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:27,789
and you know when when we say there's

416
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:30,129
four hundred and eighty-three cities and

417
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:32,649
58 counties that means you're going to

418
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:34,659
each local jurisdiction trying to see if

419
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:36,970
your business can do you know if they're

420
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:39,490
even accepting application so it is a

421
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:42,250
patchwork of ordinances across the state

422
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:45,070
so I think that's a big barrier I also

423
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:48,129
think you know again going back to I

424
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:49,900
think it's a daunting task you know

425
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:52,090
where do you even start so if you're

426
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:53,949
somebody that has been doing this for a

427
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:57,430
long time it's even hard to know where

428
00:16:53,950 --> 00:17:00,190
to start so more technical assistance is

429
00:16:57,429 --> 00:17:02,409
needed for these folks trying to you

430
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:04,150
know you know you know remove the

431
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:06,009
mystery I think when you just tell

432
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,390
people hey fill out this big long

433
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:08,559
application and you got to get a

434
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,900
background track

435
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,578
I think it's an intimidating process and

436
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,220
I think as a state we've got to keep

437
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:17,319
realizing that this is not easy for

438
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,150
folks and how do you bring them in to

439
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:21,159
the process and one of the things we

440
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:24,490
look at when we do look at enforcement

441
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,410
we are making we are looking at going

442
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,328
after the folks that really have no

443
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:29,769
intention of getting licensed but if you

444
00:17:28,328 --> 00:17:31,210
have people that are trying to get

445
00:17:29,769 --> 00:17:33,519
licensed trying to work with their local

446
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:36,940
jurisdiction in the process we're really

447
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:38,740
trying to to really make sure that we're

448
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,509
bringing those people along because

449
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,789
really we want compliance

450
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:44,890
that's what we want and I think you know

451
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:46,750
if we're working to you know I know it

452
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,640
sounds strange to say we want we've got

453
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,529
to work together with the industry to

454
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,890
make sure that everybody survives

455
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:55,960
because as the state we want the legal

456
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:58,330
market to survive we want them to do

457
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,190
well we want them to thrive and if we're

458
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:03,220
not doing it with the lis with together

459
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:05,080
with you it's not going to work yeah and

460
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:08,559
there's the difference right there

461
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:11,319
between a regulatory body that's able to

462
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,879
regulate its own local industry and a

463
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:14,109
regulatory body that's on the other side

464
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,550
of the country that has to worry about

465
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:20,399
other local industries as well there

466
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:23,200
have been questions around shipping I

467
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,990
think that's mostly quieted down last

468
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:30,250
year was when it was a really big deal

469
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:31,569
there have been issues with testing what

470
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,630
what have been some of the biggest

471
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:36,700
challenges from the regulator's point of

472
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,380
view to make sure that you're doing what

473
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,450
works for the industry but what also

474
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:43,150
works for the state it's a

475
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:45,160
transportation of cannabis in California

476
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:47,590
you have to be a distributor just to

477
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:50,170
transport cannabis between licensees and

478
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:51,789
then you also have to submit a man if

479
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,050
you have to have a manifest showing

480
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:56,440
where you're going and what you're doing

481
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:58,539
and and it is it's a great system and

482
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,430
having that in track and trace but again

483
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:02,649
it doesn't allow for a lot of

484
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,940
flexibility right if something happens

485
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:06,190
and you you need to go to another

486
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,049
premises so it's pretty strictly

487
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,670
regulated and transportation and then a

488
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:11,980
lot of these folks are carrying a lot of

489
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:13,539
cash so you know they're our

490
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,150
distributors are responsible for

491
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:18,609
collecting the taxes from the different

492
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:22,930
licensees so a lot of safety issues

493
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:24,969
regarding transportation and it is it

494
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:27,190
you know I think eventually over time

495
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:29,769
that'll that'll change I mean when you

496
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,840
look at like the alcohol world in

497
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:34,210
California you don't really have those

498
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:36,459
strict rules in place for transportation

499
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:38,470
but I think for right now that's what

500
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:41,620
needs to happen because we still have so

501
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:44,230
much illegal cannabis being transported

502
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:45,969
for the laboratories I mean I'm sure

503
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,620
we're having some of the same we are

504
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:50,230
having some of the same issues all the

505
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:53,199
other states have had we have very

506
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,980
strict testing regulations we have labs

507
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,538
that are

508
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,130
you know they're they're getting they're

509
00:19:55,538 --> 00:19:59,138
getting better at what they're testing

510
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,940
for but uh but you know one of the

511
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:03,490
things we are saying it's expensive for

512
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:06,340
them for the legal market to test and

513
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:08,019
especially if things fail you know fail

514
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:10,658
and they can't remediate it and they

515
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:12,579
have to destroy it so it's really tough

516
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:14,799
on the industry the good thing is is

517
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:17,230
that you know our our failure rate

518
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:19,990
compared to you know when we started you

519
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:23,589
know back in January of 2018 our failure

520
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:27,009
rate was at about 20% we're now down to

521
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:28,869
just about 8% the labs are getting

522
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:30,940
better the product you know there's a

523
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:32,589
lot of testing that goes in our indi

524
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,750
testing that goes prior to at the

525
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:36,308
regulatory testing so we're seeing a lot

526
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,710
of this product getting through to the

527
00:20:36,308 --> 00:20:41,138
legal market and then we've had some of

528
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:43,750
those vaping incidents in California

529
00:20:41,138 --> 00:20:46,359
where people were getting sick very sick

530
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:48,308
off of vape cartridges they had

531
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:50,709
purchased and the good thing is is that

532
00:20:48,308 --> 00:20:52,690
so far that appears that it only come

533
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,639
from the unlicensed market it has not

534
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:58,509
come from our legal regulated market

535
00:20:54,638 --> 00:20:59,918
which is really oh I mean is you know

536
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:02,769
you don't want to see people getting

537
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:06,490
sick but it's good to see that it is

538
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:09,159
working having this product tested well

539
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:10,808
and I think that from you know from a

540
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:13,179
longtime activist point of view that's

541
00:21:10,808 --> 00:21:15,548
the whole point of regulation you don't

542
00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:17,620
want to see people being able to take

543
00:21:15,548 --> 00:21:19,960
advantage so a you know in the illicit

544
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:22,148
market for ten thousand years it's been

545
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,038
fine but there's also been stories of

546
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:26,589
the random person that sprays something

547
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:27,849
that they know is bad or and it's like

548
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:29,349
you know they end up giving everybody a

549
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:32,408
bad reputation but that's the point of

550
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:36,038
regulation for anything should be just

551
00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:39,340
that make sure that it's safe with

552
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:41,679
shipping I know that there was a union

553
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:43,028
that got involved that wanted to kind of

554
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,559
try and provide all the shipping they

555
00:21:43,028 --> 00:21:47,349
didn't want smaller growers to be able

556
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:49,720
to ship themselves you don't really have

557
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:51,879
a database of that stuff the way that

558
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,798
Washington State does though so that

559
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,750
protected you from hacking because

560
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:57,220
Washington State not that long ago had

561
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,200
somebody break into their system and

562
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:01,149
find out where every single shipment of

563
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,269
cannabis was going everywhere in the

564
00:22:01,148 --> 00:22:06,779
state for like the next two weeks are

565
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:11,720
you worried about cybersecurity of

566
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:15,000
any of California's records or documents

567
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:18,329
absolutely you worry about that all the

568
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,240
time because we you know most of our

569
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:24,929
applicants submit applications online to

570
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:27,589
us I would say probably at least 98% of

571
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:30,840
the application we get is is through our

572
00:22:27,589 --> 00:22:32,669
licensing system and not paper and in

573
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:35,129
the thought I'm going to tell you the

574
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:38,430
thought that anybody hacks in and gets a

575
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:40,830
hold of your information is is really

576
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:42,840
concerning because you know you need to

577
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:44,939
if we're gonna get people to come into

578
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:47,730
the legal market they need to know that

579
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:50,640
their information is protected by the

580
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:53,309
state unless it unless it's required by

581
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,810
under our Public Records Act to disclose

582
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:58,019
you don't want people just getting a

583
00:22:54,809 --> 00:23:01,019
hold of this information and I think you

584
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:03,240
know that's our job you know and doing

585
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:06,000
our due diligence to make sure that your

586
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,519
information is not compromised so that's

587
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,279
always something you worry about and and

588
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:12,539
have you had issues has it been no not

589
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:13,589
you know we're just starting you know

590
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:16,859
we're just getting everybody

591
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:19,500
transitioned to track and trace it over

592
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:22,949
over the last six months so we haven't

593
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:25,980
had any issues yet but yeah you know I

594
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:28,410
don't have any would hear you guys but

595
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,690
yeah we want you to root we want you to

596
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:32,640
feel like when you come to the

597
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:34,170
government you're not worried that you

598
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,030
know all your information is getting in

599
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:37,980
and for safety reasons if everybody's

600
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:39,450
getting ahold of your shipping manifests

601
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,990
and they know where you're going that's

602
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:44,910
not a good thing so I mean again there's

603
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,289
only so much a state can do in terms of

604
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:48,240
municipalities they have their own

605
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:50,730
jurisdiction over certain things we've

606
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,559
seen cities for example again in the Bay

607
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:55,130
Area where Oakland

608
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:58,019
you know offered you know parody

609
00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:00,660
licensing they've offered in Berkeley

610
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:02,129
they cover some medical cannabis there

611
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,630
have been other cities that have kind of

612
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,490
picked up Oakland's banner and said yeah

613
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,350
you know what we unfairly punished this

614
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:09,200
war and now we need to make sure that

615
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:12,000
those people have the same opportunities

616
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,160
how do you reconcile the fact that as a

617
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,470
state you kind of have to stay out of

618
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,820
some of that but you've got one city

619
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:20,009
that is

620
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:22,079
happy to try and address an injustice

621
00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:24,029
and another city that's happy to keep

622
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,399
that injustice going as long as possible

623
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:28,710
yeah and I'm gonna tell you Oakland San

624
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,200
Francisco Sacramento LA the big cities

625
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:33,450
have really been the leaders these local

626
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,259
jurisdictions on the social equity front

627
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:39,779
and it's it's it the state is really

628
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:41,670
trying to catch up and looking at you

629
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:43,829
know how folks have been affected by the

630
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:46,950
war on drugs in California and sort of

631
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:49,559
writing those wrongs one thing the

632
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:52,680
administration and we have grant funding

633
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:54,690
at the state level for local for local

634
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:58,610
jurisdictions that have a local program

635
00:24:54,690 --> 00:25:02,130
in place for social equity we just

636
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:04,259
closed that application period and next

637
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:06,030
month we're gonna be awarding ten

638
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:08,910
million in grants to those cities that

639
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:12,269
have those those at local equity

640
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:16,110
programs and then just recently the

641
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:18,990
governor and his latest budget even put

642
00:25:16,109 --> 00:25:21,119
more money for next year so it's a

643
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:23,160
thirty million will be going out next

644
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,649
year so another round of funding and

645
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:28,410
what we're starting to see already is

646
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:29,970
you are the big cities already led the

647
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:32,130
charge but now you're having local

648
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:34,079
jurisdictions going hey we need to do

649
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:36,060
something in developing these programs

650
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,189
and so I think we're seeing a lot more

651
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:39,960
cities and counties that are saying hey

652
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:43,799
we need to do something about this as

653
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,809
well so a pretty it's I'm pretty proud

654
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:47,339
of the state of California for taking

655
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:49,049
this on

656
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:50,490
but you're right it's it'll be

657
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:52,049
interesting to see what happened

658
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:53,970
hopefully I can come back next year and

659
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:55,500
tell you guys how that first round of

660
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:59,490
funding went and what we were able to

661
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:01,230
accomplish that's awesome I had another

662
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:04,049
question it just popped right out of my

663
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:07,200
head just as we were talking some some

664
00:26:04,049 --> 00:26:09,599
of the issues that that have existed are

665
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,549
around security records up here pardons

666
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:15,299
expungements whether that stays on your

667
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:16,950
record or not so I mean I'm I'm really

668
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:19,440
happy to hear that actually California

669
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:22,559
as a state is is kind of encouraging as

670
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,350
much as they can within their realm of

671
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:27,450
what they're allowed to do is there

672
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:29,689
anything that you think that the state

673
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:32,240
could be doing more because I mean

674
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:35,298
it's already more than most states are

675
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,278
doing you know I say we got a lot going

676
00:26:35,298 --> 00:26:37,970
on in California just like you do up

677
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:40,519
here

678
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:42,528
I always think we can do more I mean

679
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:44,808
there's I don't think there's a day go

680
00:26:42,528 --> 00:26:48,169
by when you feel like we're probably not

681
00:26:44,808 --> 00:26:50,750
doing enough to really assist the

682
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:52,879
cannabis industry and and so and that's

683
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:54,528
good you want us to feel this way right

684
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:56,719
there's always something more we can do

685
00:26:54,528 --> 00:26:58,788
to help small businesses to level the

686
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,009
playing field and do all that and so

687
00:26:58,788 --> 00:27:03,769
that's something that is always very

688
00:27:01,009 --> 00:27:06,710
important to us and and we have a very

689
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:08,960
active cannabis industry and they're

690
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:11,000
very innovative and creative and

691
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,980
sometimes I hear these business models

692
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,569
and I like I didn't think of that one I

693
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,659
didn't think of that one so it's always

694
00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:19,579
good again I say but thank goodness for

695
00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:21,139
you guys for telling you know cuz we

696
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:23,210
wouldn't figure out you you guys have

697
00:27:21,138 --> 00:27:25,459
probably more good ideas and we the

698
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:27,259
regulator's so I always say don't keep

699
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,750
your good ideas to yourself bring them

700
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:32,210
to us so we can start implementing some

701
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:33,609
of this I remembered that earlier

702
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:36,019
question

703
00:27:33,609 --> 00:27:38,538
California's had water rights issues for

704
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:40,970
a very very long time how has that

705
00:27:38,538 --> 00:27:43,839
played into cannabis regulations in

706
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:46,429
different jurisdictions yeah that's um

707
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:48,798
probably for our cultivators that's a

708
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:51,919
really big issue for them we have a

709
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:53,839
separate state agency called the State

710
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,330
Water Resources Board that deals with

711
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:58,699
this but yeah that's become a you know

712
00:27:56,329 --> 00:28:00,888
that's a big permit you have to get when

713
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,629
you're a cultivator so where you're

714
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:05,918
getting your water how you're getting it

715
00:28:02,628 --> 00:28:08,509
very strictly regulated in California

716
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:11,028
but not hasn't really it's kind of

717
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:13,519
stayed in that Bureau and not really

718
00:28:11,028 --> 00:28:16,759
crossed over too much for us at the

719
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:18,980
bureau cuz we sort of have the supply

720
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:21,079
chain starting with distribution testing

721
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,179
labs retailers so it doesn't really hit

722
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:27,079
our agency as much but I know a lot of

723
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:30,620
our cultivators they there there is a

724
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:32,089
lot of permits that they have to get in

725
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:33,829
order to cultivate and I know that's

726
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:37,579
been very difficult to expect especially

727
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:40,579
on your small legacy cultivators sort of

728
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:42,480
a similar question here in Vancouver

729
00:28:40,579 --> 00:28:44,460
we've got a group called Metro van that

730
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,309
represents a bunch of cities in the

731
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:50,789
Lower Mainland area and all of them and

732
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:52,859
they're trying to basically say that

733
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:55,409
outdoor cannabis growing is bad for

734
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:56,819
pollution and smog to the point where

735
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:59,070
they've actually suggested that I want

736
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:02,250
bad air days people move their cannabis

737
00:28:59,069 --> 00:29:03,929
plants inside California has also

738
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:06,960
traditionally had a lot of issues with

739
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:10,140
smog has this been an issue at all that

740
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,620
you've seen well I'm not I don't not

741
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:15,509
that I know of yet I mean that it's

742
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:17,129
become an issue but I'm sure that

743
00:29:15,509 --> 00:29:20,129
doesn't mean there's not that something

744
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:21,690
going on in LA or whatever because it's

745
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,790
it's almost I don't know about you guys

746
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,440
but I like do a ton of reading like

747
00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:27,089
every night you're reading tons of

748
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,759
articles and there's always something

749
00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:31,740
going on but I'm sure that's going to

750
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:36,599
hit us very soon on these sorts of

751
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:38,250
issues all right I think we're pretty

752
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:40,409
good to go to the audience for some

753
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:42,269
questions and answers all right let's

754
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:48,660
hear one more time for Louie Ajax and

755
00:29:42,269 --> 00:29:50,940
Jamie Shaw very informative I'm coming

756
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,380
over here to you right now sir also

757
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,320
please try to keep your questions brief

758
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,580
no rambling we know how you are then we

759
00:29:55,319 --> 00:30:03,000
don't have to hear the whole story about

760
00:29:56,579 --> 00:30:04,169
the history of cannabis and just hold

761
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,390
your hand up if you have a question I'll

762
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:11,100
get right over to you hey Lauri I've

763
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:12,990
seen you speak out a lot I've seen you

764
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:14,549
speak out a lot of events I've done

765
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:17,490
public comments in front of you for

766
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:20,879
regulation specifically on topical

767
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:23,190
pesticides I remember that and you know

768
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,350
just got to say BCC did really good job

769
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:27,269
of luck publishing the draft regulations

770
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:29,699
taking in public comment across the

771
00:30:27,269 --> 00:30:31,200
state listening to the business just

772
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,940
listening to you now and talking about

773
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,299
how you want to work with the cannabis

774
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,870
industry in California is inspiring

775
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:39,869
especially compared to another

776
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:43,259
department like the DMV where they don't

777
00:30:39,869 --> 00:30:45,509
want to work with you so nobody wants to

778
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:47,640
be compared to the DMV thank you so

779
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:50,789
thank you for that and my question is

780
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,450
I'm starting to see a lot of Wars going

781
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:54,480
on between

782
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:55,889
wine in cannabis in California specific

783
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,200
example would be Santa Barbara County

784
00:30:55,888 --> 00:31:00,619
that has limited the amount of cannabis

785
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,240
that will be cultivated in the county

786
00:31:00,619 --> 00:31:05,369
reasons for that being land issues water

787
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,829
issues but also what they're calling the

788
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:10,229
terpene drift where these like terpenes

789
00:31:07,829 --> 00:31:14,069
draw up going to the air and affect the

790
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:15,990
terroir of the wine I'm in the taste so

791
00:31:14,069 --> 00:31:17,638
any other issues like that coming up in

792
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:19,589
like Sonoma County or other parts of

793
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:22,199
California that you see and how do you

794
00:31:19,589 --> 00:31:24,449
see that being resolved yeah it's it's

795
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,980
actually I find that that's fascinating

796
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:28,620
what's going on with our wine industry

797
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,298
in the cannabis industry and how you

798
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:32,548
know Farms next to each other are

799
00:31:30,298 --> 00:31:35,369
dealing with you know because our our

800
00:31:32,548 --> 00:31:37,918
wineries can use pesticides that our

801
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:41,250
cannabis folks can't use and how do they

802
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:44,009
share you know being side by side yes I

803
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:46,259
think this issue will it is is already

804
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:50,730
for lack of a better way drifting up

805
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:54,298
north again I think you're looking at as

806
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:56,669
much as we can now probably engage our

807
00:31:54,298 --> 00:31:59,429
wine grower our grape growers and

808
00:31:56,669 --> 00:32:03,179
whatnot and I think already there's sort

809
00:31:59,429 --> 00:32:04,860
of a like sort of like natural they're

810
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:06,929
all going well wait a sec we don't want

811
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:08,668
the cannabis people next to us and the

812
00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:11,159
cannabis people don't want them next to

813
00:32:08,669 --> 00:32:13,049
us so it's an interesting issue that

814
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:15,360
they didn't really see coming I will say

815
00:32:13,048 --> 00:32:17,940
this I think the alcohol folks are

816
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:19,589
saying please don't regulate us like you

817
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:21,538
regulate cannabis because I think

818
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:23,398
they're worried that at some point we

819
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:26,638
might be testing grapes the way we test

820
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:28,500
cannabis and so in some ways maybe

821
00:32:26,638 --> 00:32:30,658
that's good they're seeing that because

822
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:33,179
I think what we're starting to see is

823
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:36,090
other industry now getting affected and

824
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:38,548
seeing like wow cannabis is really

825
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:39,778
regulated really highly regulated and we

826
00:32:38,548 --> 00:32:41,970
don't want to be regulated to that

827
00:32:39,778 --> 00:32:48,599
extent so I think that'll be interesting

828
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:52,220
to see how that plays out hello

829
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:55,619
Laurie and Jamie my question is about

830
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:59,339
edibles or alternative products here in

831
00:32:55,619 --> 00:33:01,918
Canada we have legal dried cannabis but

832
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:04,709
I understand in California you have more

833
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,139
experience rolling out edible products

834
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:09,360
it's gonna happen this year in Canada

835
00:33:07,138 --> 00:33:12,418
can you talk a little bit about edible

836
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:15,329
products in California yeah we we

837
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:17,669
edibles we started out with edibles

838
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:20,849
right on the onset I know that's a

839
00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:22,679
little different than here and one of

840
00:33:20,849 --> 00:33:24,058
the things we really looked at is that's

841
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:26,220
where we really looked at some of the

842
00:33:24,058 --> 00:33:29,099
other states and how that rollout went

843
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:31,860
and so we have some fairly strict

844
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:33,928
regulation when it comes to edibles

845
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:35,609
you know the package how you know how

846
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:38,159
much you know you can have in a package

847
00:33:35,609 --> 00:33:39,898
and child resistant packaging what what

848
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,500
those edibles can look like they can't

849
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:45,959
be attractive to children and so I will

850
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,278
say we've we really that's where we

851
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,048
really did look at some of the other

852
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:52,099
states and seeing where they were having

853
00:33:49,048 --> 00:33:55,470
some issues but you know like anything

854
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:57,388
you know edibles are they constantly

855
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,980
change I this does the other day we had

856
00:33:57,388 --> 00:34:01,469
to ask our Department of Public Health

857
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:03,599
we saw cannabis infused toothpicks and

858
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:05,850
we thought well is this what is this is

859
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:07,918
this an edible what is this and you know

860
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:10,618
it came out it's an edible so I think

861
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,398
for further regulator though I think

862
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:15,720
whatever regulations you put in place

863
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:17,730
it's always going to change with the

864
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:19,858
different products coming our way and do

865
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:21,539
they really fit into the edible category

866
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:22,889
and whatnot so I think that's always

867
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:24,809
going to be a challenge for any

868
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:28,579
regulator is keeping up with the

869
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:28,578
innovation of the the market

870
00:34:29,329 --> 00:34:34,500
alright Laurie I'm wondering is there

871
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:37,679
any communication between your Bureau

872
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:41,099
and Health Canada and learning from each

873
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:44,068
other and on how to adjust public policy

874
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:46,619
accordingly moving forward so your

875
00:34:44,068 --> 00:34:49,769
health Canada did come to California and

876
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:52,679
we did meet with them and then they they

877
00:34:49,769 --> 00:34:54,838
were pretty they call they work a lot

878
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:58,079
with our Public Health Department here

879
00:34:54,838 --> 00:35:00,860
and so you know our I think the best

880
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,930
thing we can do is just share

881
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:06,380
what we're going through our experiences

882
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:07,969
share our regulations and and provide

883
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:11,030
that you know open line of communication

884
00:35:07,969 --> 00:35:13,489
and I will just say this nobody wants to

885
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:15,080
like you know just like you as an

886
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:17,179
industry folk you want to be able to

887
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,969
call your counterpart and get an answer

888
00:35:17,179 --> 00:35:21,500
and that's our commitment not

889
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:23,779
necessarily shaping what they do here

890
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,340
but at least making sure that we're

891
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:27,170
answering their calls and we're

892
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,760
providing whatever support we can

893
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:39,170
because I think that's good for

894
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:41,300
everybody slow clap hi

895
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:43,490
you mentioned packaging I haven't

896
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:46,490
actually been any in any of the

897
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:48,739
so-called legal stores in Vancouver yet

898
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:50,629
but my friends tell me that they're

899
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:55,219
packaged within an inch of their life in

900
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:56,990
non-reusable etc etc this doesn't seem

901
00:35:55,219 --> 00:36:06,250
like a good idea for the long haul

902
00:35:56,989 --> 00:36:09,979
what's California doing well we package

903
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:12,349
we do a lot of packaging in California

904
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:16,309
and we even have child resistant

905
00:36:12,349 --> 00:36:18,529
packaging on flour so a lot of packaging

906
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:20,900
and we get a lot of complaints that you

907
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:23,840
know it's hard to recycle and whatnot

908
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:25,880
and I I do think like we're gonna I

909
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,289
think in California you know what are we

910
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,510
really trying especially with like

911
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:31,460
cannabis flour do do we really think

912
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:33,950
somebody's a child's gonna get into it

913
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:36,230
and smoke I don't know but I think we

914
00:36:33,949 --> 00:36:39,829
did start out very conservative because

915
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:41,630
the last thing we want is for children

916
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:43,549
to get into this packaging we want to

917
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:46,280
make sure that parents you know are

918
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:48,800
putting it in a safe place and I think

919
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,110
we want to make sure that on the onset

920
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,730
if something we want to make sure we had

921
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:56,680
those protections in place and I think

922
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:59,539
in some ways that's good but I think as

923
00:36:56,679 --> 00:37:01,699
we evolve I think it's time to look at

924
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:04,219
some of those and determine where do we

925
00:37:01,699 --> 00:37:06,409
really need to really be strictly

926
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:08,209
regulate that packaging but you know

927
00:37:06,409 --> 00:37:11,149
there's a part of us that we don't want

928
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:13,789
any negative press to come on our legal

929
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:14,588
market for things if we didn't do the

930
00:37:13,789 --> 00:37:16,509
proper prick

931
00:37:14,588 --> 00:37:19,210
Auctions and again it's just not really

932
00:37:16,509 --> 00:37:21,099
knowing I think as we see like maybe

933
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:26,380
there's not an incidence and we start

934
00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:29,229
making those changes I've just got a

935
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,489
question about banking and payment

936
00:37:29,228 --> 00:37:33,129
processing could you give us a little

937
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:36,190
update into cali as to what that's what

938
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:37,630
the latest is on that well I don't

939
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:40,150
really I don't have any latest

940
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:42,430
information on banking as as you know we

941
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:44,650
struggle to get banks and credit unions

942
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:48,699
to to Bank the cannabis industry in

943
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:50,798
California our what we do is right now

944
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:52,149
just try to work with those banking

945
00:37:50,798 --> 00:37:54,489
regulators to give them as much

946
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:55,989
information for those that do want to

947
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:57,548
bank the industry to provide them

948
00:37:55,989 --> 00:38:00,039
whatever we can to give them the

949
00:37:57,548 --> 00:38:02,288
assurances that this person is in good

950
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:04,329
standing and so I think you know right

951
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:06,278
now the banks are still hesitant to get

952
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:08,548
in it's very expensive for them to bank

953
00:38:06,278 --> 00:38:11,798
the industry and then you know for us

954
00:38:08,548 --> 00:38:13,538
you know we want to get out of the we

955
00:38:11,798 --> 00:38:16,538
want to get out of taking accepting cash

956
00:38:13,539 --> 00:38:18,549
at the bureau or you know last month

957
00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:20,170
we're accepting like 3 million in cash

958
00:38:18,548 --> 00:38:22,690
for licensing fees I mean it just

959
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:24,759
doesn't make a lot of sense right and

960
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:27,278
all the security we have to put into

961
00:38:24,759 --> 00:38:30,009
place so and you know we understand the

962
00:38:27,278 --> 00:38:31,929
average if somebody does get banked and

963
00:38:30,009 --> 00:38:34,119
the bank doesn't know they're a cannabis

964
00:38:31,929 --> 00:38:35,710
industry it's usually 12 to 18 months

965
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:38,460
and that Bank figures it out and then

966
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:40,539
they have to start all over again so

967
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,999
you've seen some bills in the

968
00:38:40,539 --> 00:38:45,609
legislature on banking so I think we're

969
00:38:42,998 --> 00:38:46,959
continuing to try to push the issue and

970
00:38:45,608 --> 00:38:48,578
hopefully we're going to see something

971
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,139
from I mean I think if we're gonna see

972
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:51,489
anything from the federal government

973
00:38:50,139 --> 00:38:53,650
that would be a start

974
00:38:51,489 --> 00:38:55,869
to see it when it comes to banking issue

975
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:57,729
because it's just not safe anymore for

976
00:38:55,869 --> 00:38:59,640
people one of the things that came up

977
00:38:57,728 --> 00:39:01,748
around that was starting a state bank

978
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:05,409
what do you think the possibilities of

979
00:39:01,748 --> 00:39:08,588
that happening are I I think it would be

980
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:10,808
very hard one I think it would take too

981
00:39:08,588 --> 00:39:13,568
long to get up and running and I don't

982
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:17,229
know how effective it would be

983
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:19,690
I really think really working on our

984
00:39:17,228 --> 00:39:21,968
current banks and credit unions and

985
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,950
probably giving them the assurances that

986
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:26,108
we need because a lot of the information

987
00:39:23,949 --> 00:39:27,728
we have as a state regulator is what the

988
00:39:26,108 --> 00:39:28,329
banks want to see and I think

989
00:39:27,728 --> 00:39:30,489
continually

990
00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:33,340
working on that at our level and then at

991
00:39:30,489 --> 00:39:35,409
the federal level and and I'm going to

992
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,730
tell you as a regulator lower it's it's

993
00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:39,099
really hard when you're dealing with

994
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:40,659
such a cash intensive business it's hard

995
00:39:39,099 --> 00:39:42,849
for you guys to pay your vendors and

996
00:39:40,659 --> 00:39:45,399
that's hard for us to know it you know

997
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:50,860
to regulate something when it's so much

998
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:55,030
cash up hey Laurie a quick question

999
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:56,440
about vapor pens just had a good wanted

1000
00:39:55,030 --> 00:40:00,220
to see if there was an action plan in

1001
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,539
order to sustainably recycle paper pens

1002
00:40:00,219 --> 00:40:02,739
as that whole industry has gotten a lot

1003
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:04,389
more popular I've just heard that

1004
00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:09,969
there's a lot of regulatory issues with

1005
00:40:04,389 --> 00:40:12,250
that yes so we require like when you

1006
00:40:09,969 --> 00:40:15,730
have to make it like unrecognizable and

1007
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:18,070
unusable but most of that is handled by

1008
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:20,679
you know guess what another state agency

1009
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:24,039
in California called Cal recycle so we

1010
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:26,109
got a lot of state agencies but you're I

1011
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:28,179
think it's you know just like the other

1012
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:29,769
gentleman's questions on packaging I

1013
00:40:28,179 --> 00:40:32,469
think California needs to start really

1014
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:35,079
looking at how best to recycle these

1015
00:40:32,469 --> 00:40:37,719
products these vape the fate pens the

1016
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:39,460
housing units all the packaging and I

1017
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:41,409
think you know California is very

1018
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,940
concerned about the environment and all

1019
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:46,599
that I think you're gonna start seeing

1020
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:48,550
some changes go through when it comes to

1021
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:50,380
those issues I think like again we're

1022
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:52,180
learning more about these products and

1023
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:55,780
now we're learning more about you know

1024
00:40:52,179 --> 00:41:00,219
cannabis waste and so again I think

1025
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:02,290
you're gonna see more of that I my name

1026
00:41:00,219 --> 00:41:05,079
is Jeff I have a question about prison

1027
00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:08,650
reform in California I'm over here I'm

1028
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:12,489
over here prison reform in California I

1029
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:15,789
know that they've promised to to let out

1030
00:41:12,489 --> 00:41:17,979
all of our men and women tell us about

1031
00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:21,429
full clemency how many have been let out

1032
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:24,000
or what is the plan to release our plant

1033
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:26,919
prisoners that should not be in jail

1034
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,900
so that doesn't fall under the Bureau of

1035
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,090
cannabis control where we're not

1036
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,099
involved with that that's at our at the

1037
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:34,870
administration level with the governor

1038
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:36,759
and so I don't I can't answer that

1039
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:38,829
question for you I can speak on a little

1040
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,750
bit a lot of cities and counties are

1041
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:43,759
already expunging Records and they just

1042
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:46,639
I can't remember the name of the Nerds

1043
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,620
that came up with the AI algorithm that

1044
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:50,779
searches through the database and finds

1045
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:52,579
people whose records would be helped by

1046
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,170
the new law and fills out the paperwork

1047
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:56,719
and just sends it off to the DA and the

1048
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:58,099
DA either signs off on it or decides to

1049
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:59,689
try to fight it but that's going on

1050
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:01,460
right now so they've already got like

1051
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:03,500
five hundred thousand people have had

1052
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,329
their records clear I'm Marissa who's

1053
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,699
from San Francisco the cannabis

1054
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:14,449
regulator I know she could probably give

1055
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:18,439
you a lot of information hi everyone the

1056
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:19,460
nerds are at Code for America and in San

1057
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,230
Francisco actually were the first

1058
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:24,889
jurisdiction to retroactively Lee

1059
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:31,490
expunge over 9,000 records I don't think

1060
00:42:24,889 --> 00:42:33,440
we thank you in the Bay Area I think

1061
00:42:31,489 --> 00:42:35,809
you'd be hard-pressed especially in our

1062
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,090
local prisons to find anyone

1063
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:39,679
incarcerated for just a cannabis offense

1064
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:42,530
on the federal level I think the work is

1065
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:44,480
still needed for sure but yeah the the

1066
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:47,180
programs are happening we want to

1067
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,670
encourage other jurisdictions to do the

1068
00:42:47,179 --> 00:42:51,109
same work it is doable you can do it you

1069
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:52,579
call the San Francisco District

1070
00:42:51,110 --> 00:43:05,690
Attorney's Office speak to George Cusco

1071
00:42:52,579 --> 00:43:10,759
and he'll tell you how thank you hello

1072
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:12,530
my name is Ellen okay uh you were

1073
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:16,850
talking about the different conditions

1074
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:23,090
in California for medical versus in

1075
00:43:16,849 --> 00:43:25,400
Canada and I just wanted to say that

1076
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:26,840
Canadian editions actually seem quite

1077
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,400
different because we have a medical

1078
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,630
system here that pays for things so we

1079
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,599
don't have to go to pay to get

1080
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:34,430
prescriptions so we can get a doctor's

1081
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:35,719
prescription for free providing of

1082
00:43:34,429 --> 00:43:37,250
course we can find a doctor who will

1083
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:46,329
give us a prescription that's still an

1084
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:48,139
issue so here we have to our new

1085
00:43:46,329 --> 00:43:51,739
dispensaries or whatever we want to call

1086
00:43:48,139 --> 00:43:55,608
them our new recreational outlets can

1087
00:43:51,739 --> 00:43:57,649
only provide a dosage of 10 milligrams

1088
00:43:55,608 --> 00:44:00,828
okay and that's a problem for our

1089
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:02,809
medical users so essentially our legacy

1090
00:44:00,829 --> 00:44:05,180
dispensaries are being shut down which

1091
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:07,849
we're providing all the medical doses

1092
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:09,798
and stuff and now these new dispensaries

1093
00:44:07,849 --> 00:44:11,900
the legal ones are being opened with a

1094
00:44:09,798 --> 00:44:14,958
ten milligram per dose limit which is

1095
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:16,430
totally ineffective and you know like

1096
00:44:14,958 --> 00:44:19,038
you can imagine a kid with draw vets

1097
00:44:16,429 --> 00:44:21,129
having to take 2,500 milligrams a dose

1098
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:22,940
and having to take two hundred and

1099
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:24,709
twenty five hundred pills I don't know

1100
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,509
what that is but it's a lot okay it's

1101
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:28,548
totally unreasonable it's just wrong and

1102
00:44:26,509 --> 00:44:30,978
this is a real issue that has to be

1103
00:44:28,548 --> 00:44:33,469
dealt with so how did you guys start out

1104
00:44:30,978 --> 00:44:36,889
was did they just start out having any

1105
00:44:33,469 --> 00:44:40,278
possible dose or you know like we're

1106
00:44:36,889 --> 00:44:42,650
limited now so yeah so that's the

1107
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:44,449
manufacturer part of it is handled by

1108
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:47,690
our Department of Public Health and they

1109
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:49,548
do have limits on package size and ten

1110
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:52,999
milligram dose but it is different

1111
00:44:49,548 --> 00:44:55,849
between the adult use and medical market

1112
00:44:52,998 --> 00:44:59,118
so it's a higher limit for medical

1113
00:44:55,849 --> 00:45:03,829
patients and it is for adult use but an

1114
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:05,509
in it but again they if they can sell

1115
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:08,329
the higher dose if they have if they're

1116
00:45:05,509 --> 00:45:10,998
designated as a medical retailer so

1117
00:45:08,329 --> 00:45:13,278
they're licensed is designated and so

1118
00:45:10,998 --> 00:45:13,909
that's that's how we're doing it right

1119
00:45:13,278 --> 00:45:16,248
now

1120
00:45:13,909 --> 00:45:18,588
and then I should mention California is

1121
00:45:16,248 --> 00:45:21,078
also because as most probably some of

1122
00:45:18,588 --> 00:45:25,608
you know our collective cooperative

1123
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:27,650
model was us that that sunsetted early

1124
00:45:25,608 --> 00:45:29,478
in January of this year so we don't have

1125
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:31,369
the collective and cooperatives but

1126
00:45:29,478 --> 00:45:33,948
there is a bill pending in the

1127
00:45:31,369 --> 00:45:35,838
legislature - what what's really

1128
00:45:33,949 --> 00:45:36,920
happening California is similar to what

1129
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:38,869
you were saying we had a lot of

1130
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:41,659
compassion care programs that would

1131
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:43,729
really help our veterans and our our

1132
00:45:41,659 --> 00:45:45,798
terminally ill patients and once the

1133
00:45:43,728 --> 00:45:47,468
collective cooperative model which you

1134
00:45:45,798 --> 00:45:49,969
know allowed these folks to give them

1135
00:45:47,469 --> 00:45:52,400
medicinal cannabis went away there there

1136
00:45:49,969 --> 00:45:54,139
really wasn't a path for them so we do

1137
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,660
have some pending legislation that would

1138
00:45:54,139 --> 00:45:59,268
allow our cultivators and manufacturers

1139
00:45:56,659 --> 00:46:01,368
to donate product to a retailer to give

1140
00:45:59,268 --> 00:46:03,258
to those compassion Care program at the

1141
00:46:01,369 --> 00:46:04,729
local jurisdiction so we'll see what

1142
00:46:03,259 --> 00:46:07,039
happens if that gets signed by the

1143
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:09,068
governor so something else we're trying

1144
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:11,229
to you know and

1145
00:46:09,068 --> 00:46:13,418
and there's been talk of doing something

1146
00:46:11,228 --> 00:46:15,038
like that in Canada when we get back to

1147
00:46:13,418 --> 00:46:16,179
medical because basically one of the

1148
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,039
reasons why we haven't talked about

1149
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:19,059
medical more is because the federal

1150
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:21,609
government has said there will be a

1151
00:46:19,059 --> 00:46:22,749
review once we've actually kind of got

1152
00:46:21,608 --> 00:46:25,028
this other one in place so they've just

1153
00:46:22,748 --> 00:46:29,468
been able to just push off everything to

1154
00:46:25,028 --> 00:46:33,338
that point I'm just curious if there is

1155
00:46:29,469 --> 00:46:38,409
a process in place to receive steak

1156
00:46:33,338 --> 00:46:41,828
industry stakeholders input for when

1157
00:46:38,409 --> 00:46:43,808
you're creating regulations yes oh boy

1158
00:46:41,829 --> 00:46:45,849
you need to come to California and we

1159
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:46,269
have we have a really robust I'll say

1160
00:46:45,849 --> 00:46:49,989
robot

1161
00:46:46,268 --> 00:46:52,358
it's wild yeah if it gets wild so yes so

1162
00:46:49,989 --> 00:46:55,059
what happens is at the agency level we

1163
00:46:52,358 --> 00:46:57,759
develop regulations and then once we

1164
00:46:55,059 --> 00:46:59,979
have our draft regulations we provide

1165
00:46:57,759 --> 00:47:01,449
them and then we go around the usually

1166
00:46:59,978 --> 00:47:03,818
go around the state and do public

1167
00:47:01,449 --> 00:47:05,318
hearings so folks can either they can

1168
00:47:03,818 --> 00:47:07,389
come to those public hearings give

1169
00:47:05,318 --> 00:47:10,659
public comment they can also write them

1170
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:14,408
in they can email them to us so we we do

1171
00:47:10,659 --> 00:47:16,088
a really really in-depth process of

1172
00:47:14,409 --> 00:47:18,189
getting public comments and then once we

1173
00:47:16,088 --> 00:47:20,349
get those public comments we're required

1174
00:47:18,188 --> 00:47:23,498
to respond to those public comments so

1175
00:47:20,349 --> 00:47:26,949
for example last year when we were doing

1176
00:47:23,498 --> 00:47:29,588
our final regulations the bureau I think

1177
00:47:26,949 --> 00:47:32,380
processed over 8,000 comments that came

1178
00:47:29,588 --> 00:47:35,078
in and that's all that's all available

1179
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:38,108
to anybody to see how we responded in

1180
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:39,759
addition for every regulation we put in

1181
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:42,400
place we have to do what's called an

1182
00:47:39,759 --> 00:47:45,068
initial statement of reason meaning we

1183
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,929
have to say why we're putting that

1184
00:47:45,068 --> 00:47:48,728
regulation in place so if we tell

1185
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:50,528
retailers they're gonna be open from

1186
00:47:48,728 --> 00:47:52,808
6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. we have to say

1187
00:47:50,528 --> 00:47:56,018
what's the reasoning for that and we

1188
00:47:52,809 --> 00:47:58,028
have to justify that reason so it can't

1189
00:47:56,018 --> 00:48:00,998
the only problem with that robust

1190
00:47:58,028 --> 00:48:03,068
process it's a lengthy process so you

1191
00:48:00,998 --> 00:48:04,629
know so it there's a balance there so we

1192
00:48:03,068 --> 00:48:07,838
try to get through as quickly as

1193
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:10,778
possible but yes there's a lot of we do

1194
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:13,058
encourage that feedback thank you all so

1195
00:48:10,778 --> 00:48:16,670
very much sorry we're out of time one

1196
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:19,840
more time Laurie Ajax Jaime's char

1197
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:19,840
