let's see what we can eat of the

50
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:06,118
questions so we heard a lot of the

51
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:09,079
latest developments in Germany today

52
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:11,699
pillar one pillar two I won't um

53
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,640
reiterate on on that I will give you a

54
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:17,219
quick overview of the history of

55
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:22,519
cannabis in in Germany so the latest

56
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:26,120
reform we had was in 1996 the bear hemp

57
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:28,980
was where farmers were allowed again to

58
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,280
cultivate hemp on their fields before

59
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:35,579
1996 even that was prohibited that was

60
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:39,060
the big reform from 1996 what they

61
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:42,620
forget were the seats so they said the

62
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:47,039
seed trading of seats is not allowed if

63
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:49,200
it is for an unlawful purpose and only

64
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,479
farmers allowed to to sell seeds rather

65
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:54,179
than the Netherlands and in the Czech

66
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:56,179
Republic they allowed to sell to sell

67
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,920
seats that was the first big

68
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,260
disadvantage in 1996 and there was one

69
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:03,479
provision in the new law called the

70
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:07,439
misuse of intoxication has to be ruled

71
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:11,399
out and this provision caused a lot of

72
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:13,560
trouble still right now then there was a

73
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,239
long time there was nothing from 1996

74
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:20,819
till 19 till 70 to 2014 2014 the first

75
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,420
patients were granted their exemption

76
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:26,818
for using cannabis as a medicine

77
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:29,939
we started with 1 000 patients about

78
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:33,119
that time and there was this lawsuit of

79
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:36,680
this patients who applied or who wanted

80
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,780
to grow his own cannabis on his balcony

81
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:43,019
to provide himself with cannabis as a

82
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,699
medicine he won this case finally in the

83
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,219
last instance and the German government

84
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:49,679
didn't like that that every patient can

85
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:52,080
grow his cannabis on his own balcony so

86
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,500
they set up a whole law in 2017 the

87
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,299
Caribbean cannabis as medicine act

88
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:01,199
as I said we started with 1000 patients

89
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:03,299
now we have probably 200 000 250 000

90
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,859
patients no one knows exactly because

91
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:09,360
these figures are not documented

92
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:13,739
we have

93
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,360
again Imports last year 25 tons of

94
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,639
medical cannabis were imported to

95
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,239
Germany we had a domestic production

96
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:24,418
about 1.52 tons altogether with all

97
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:26,758
these three domestic cultivators we're

98
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:29,279
talking about total revenue in the

99
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,259
market of probably 300 million euros

100
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:34,198
according to the reimbursement figures

101
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:37,259
but still these numbers just a guess

102
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:40,199
it's not documented what's really how

103
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:43,259
big the the size of the market really is

104
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:46,560
so a small Market still

105
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:50,040
and these are one figures but I want to

106
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:53,060
tell you also the Wheel World here in

107
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:56,040
February 2023 I had three court cases

108
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:59,339
for the um and the criminal offense was

109
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,939
the trading of CBD oil in February in

110
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:05,039
within three weeks one acquittal one a

111
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:07,019
sentence was eight months on probation

112
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,780
and the other one was 19 months without

113
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:14,698
probation so this is the reality besides

114
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:17,459
180 000 con consumers uh getting having

115
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:20,340
criminal proceedings by police and then

116
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:23,219
shut down by the prosecutor so that's

117
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:25,859
the situation we we have right now

118
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,320
um Philip let's let's start with you uh

119
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,538
what and the most important thing is of

120
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,879
course as we heard many times this

121
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:35,478
morning uh cannabis will be removed from

122
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:38,279
the narcotic act this is a milestone

123
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:40,139
this is a milestone for all the CBD

124
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:42,599
Traders which are prosecuted right now

125
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:45,300
the CBD flower Trader CBE oil Traders

126
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,759
this is a milestone for the consumers

127
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,340
and probably a milestone for the medical

128
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,840
cannabis industry

129
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:54,719
Phillip what do you make of this draft

130
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:57,000
what do you think what potential can

131
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,520
that be for your company tell us a

132
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,339
little bit about damicon and what you

133
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:05,099
make of it and what the chances and

134
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:07,619
options of that yeah so Joe demikan is

135
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,280
the only uh German company who won one

136
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:13,379
of the three licenses back then in 2018

137
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:15,179
2019 from the government so we produce

138
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:17,939
for the government right now wonton here

139
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,100
in Germany we also process Imports

140
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:21,899
obviously because we are not allowed to

141
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,600
grow anything in Germany which we then

142
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:26,818
can sell also to the German Market which

143
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,259
we obviously see as a big disadvantage

144
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,280
but that's how it is right now in

145
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,038
Germany

146
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:35,099
obviously what you just mentioned Kai in

147
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:36,659
terms of the draft which has been leaked

148
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,400
um there I think there's quite some

149
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,259
potential if you have been a Mary Jane

150
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:43,500
you have seen maybe some talks as well

151
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:46,199
the market says okay it will grow in

152
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,360
size in terms of three to ten times

153
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,879
um so I think there will be a huge

154
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,038
growth in the beginning it may be a bit

155
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,779
limited by the number of prescriptions

156
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,599
or doctors who are willing to prescribe

157
00:06:54,779 --> 00:07:00,059
but I think as more as we remove the

158
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,740
stigma from Cannabis this obviously will

159
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,500
lead to a market growth

160
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,538
and we ourselves prepared for that so in

161
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,180
terms of obviously a good supplier

162
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:11,519
Network that we are able to have good

163
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,620
medical flowers to be delivered to

164
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,359
Germany on the one hand and obviously

165
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,519
logistical wise also to get it

166
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,139
distributed to the pharmacist because I

167
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,240
think this will be then when the market

168
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,098
grows obviously a certain bottleneck

169
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,960
next to that I think you didn't mention

170
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:27,240
get the Social Clubs which are also part

171
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,418
of the First Column as they call it in

172
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,759
Germany so that first draft of the law

173
00:07:29,418 --> 00:07:35,219
we really um are eager to see what will

174
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,500
happen there when they may start growing

175
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,660
as well it's not yet clear how exactly

176
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,120
it will happen but we just can say that

177
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,280
we have enough space at our facility we

178
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,899
have 12 factors in total and 30 000

179
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,719
square meters of facility buildings

180
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:52,318
where also we may enable Social Clubs

181
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,880
obviously to grow cannabis at very high

182
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,039
standards and I think that is very

183
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,199
important to say let's stick to the

184
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:00,478
medical standards which we have in order

185
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:03,360
to ensure High product quality because

186
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,639
we have seen many different products I

187
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,860
would say to keep it neutral in Germany

188
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,199
and I think to stick to that quality

189
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,598
scheme is very important

190
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,580
and we are very open to support those

191
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:16,680
cannabis clubs as well so I think there

192
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:18,478
will be a major change with that First

193
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,639
Column so taking it out of the narcotics

194
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,680
law which will definitely grow the

195
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,060
market in terms of medical cannabis but

196
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,360
also obviously in terms of the Social

197
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:30,500
Clubs and do you think that the numbers

198
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,120
of prescription will increase

199
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,799
just by the fact that it is removed that

200
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,719
it's not actually recording anymore yes

201
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,519
maybe some of you don't know exactly the

202
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,919
German system so a narcotic prescription

203
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:43,139
is a serialized prescription so the

204
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:45,480
doctors need to apply to obtain their

205
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:47,220
block of prescriptions and can't get

206
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,680
like hundred thousands because they are

207
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,778
limited somehow and so they are very

208
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,939
restricted on how to prescribe uh

209
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:55,919
medical cannabis right now and in the

210
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,860
pharmacies it the workload to handle

211
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,599
narcotics is also tremendous and for

212
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,580
ourselves as well so we need to do a

213
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,019
full inventory twice a year it's a

214
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,959
nightmare when you really got to do that

215
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:09,019
and count every single cram so I think

216
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,579
with taking it out of the narcotics law

217
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:14,459
many hurdles which are there right now

218
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,500
in the market will fall and we will be

219
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,759
able to serve more patients adequately

220
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,679
with good product

221
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:23,879
are you in direct contact with

222
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:27,059
Physicians saying if that will move from

223
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:29,159
the narcotic we will be more openly

224
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:31,859
prescribed cannabis then or is that not

225
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:34,139
a topic well we see that they are more

226
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,300
oh they will get more open so that is

227
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:38,039
like first feedback we got

228
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:39,599
um and I think obviously then at the

229
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:42,179
same time you may have seen that on

230
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,159
Friday Germany passed a law that the

231
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:46,259
reimbursement of cannabis products will

232
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,000
also be easing it so I think these two

233
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:50,759
common factors in combination will lead

234
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,200
that the market will grow and will open

235
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:55,559
new opportunities

236
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,600
like you can't give in more exact

237
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:59,639
estimation on what's Happening currently

238
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,139
we don't have more exact estimations as

239
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:03,360
I said I mean estimates are between

240
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:05,759
factor three to ten

241
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,680
um I think it will take some time it's

242
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,958
education about educating doctors as

243
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,338
well but it will definitely lead to a

244
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:15,239
growth of the market

245
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:17,160
good Zeta tell us a bit about oil what

246
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,360
are you doing with this organization and

247
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,860
what do you make of these new

248
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,800
developments in Germany in terms of

249
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,539
medical and and Social Club

250
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,039
first I want to thank you for the

251
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:27,659
invitation to be here and I'm really

252
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:28,919
delighted to speak in front of all of

253
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:31,259
you

254
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:34,559
umca is not a standard industrial

255
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:36,419
organization but we are a kind of one

256
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,299
voice approach which means from the

257
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:41,579
pharmaceutical industry of doctors

258
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:43,859
Association but more important patient

259
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,320
organization and I think Kai mentioned

260
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,539
it so nicely that at the end the reason

261
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,100
why you all are sitting here is based on

262
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:52,679
the Supreme Court decision which one

263
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,420
patient fought through and is Gosha and

264
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:56,338
fleta mentioned before this happened in

265
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:57,838
all the other countries I don't know how

266
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:59,880
much you are engaged in this kind of

267
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,140
field but I think this is worthwhile a

268
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:03,419
consideration

269
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:05,879
the second one is I would just like to

270
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:09,120
respond to this narcotic situation

271
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:12,419
because I think this this is a very big

272
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,000
question mark the route to reimbursement

273
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:17,759
is a prescription and the route for a

274
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,159
product is to be as in a status of a

275
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,899
prescription which means the narcotic

276
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,719
status gives a prescription gives

277
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:27,419
reimbursement so my question mark is if

278
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,459
it's not a narcotic anymore like CBD

279
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:32,458
which is also not a prescription product

280
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:33,899
and not reimbursed what will happen with

281
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:36,599
cannabis

282
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:38,039
in a medicinal field and here I think

283
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,200
there will be a big question mark

284
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:42,299
opening and when you hear it before the

285
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,778
political discussion they will try to

286
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:48,838
fix it well we have the whole health

287
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:52,259
insurance companies 130 I think at

288
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:55,200
present who will not be really the the

289
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:57,419
ones to bring it forward so to fix

290
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,860
something which has been lost is again a

291
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:02,219
process of years

292
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:04,860
and I might you might find yourself in a

293
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,600
few months or years pretty disappointed

294
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,800
when the prescription might not come

295
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,079
because I don't know what kind of

296
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:12,179
prescriptions will then happen and to

297
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,219
feel pity with doctors to make a

298
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:17,759
prescription on narcotics who daily

299
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:20,759
prescribe Fentanyl abestral and all the

300
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,679
opiates is maybe not clear to me maybe

301
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:25,259
somebody knows more about it but talking

302
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:28,078
with the doctors associations I never

303
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:30,179
saw that this was a hurdle and not to

304
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,958
have it as an narcotic does it delete

305
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:36,719
the memory that it is a narcotic and has

306
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:38,458
some harm at the doctor's perspective I

307
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,200
think this is questions which would have

308
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:43,319
been maybe also interesting to ask a

309
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,240
doctor who is unfortunate here today but

310
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,940
um I think I would clarify that before

311
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,459
before moving something forward which

312
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,320
might be maybe a release for the

313
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:55,018
cannabis clubs but to my personal

314
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,639
assessment are pretty far away and I

315
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:58,440
think it was very nicely mentioned also

316
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,899
before that

317
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,639
um there are several federal states who

318
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:05,278
already told that they will not allow it

319
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,959
and the same was the pilot project so I

320
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,899
think there are so many hurdles piling

321
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:12,419
up in a lot of kind of visionary

322
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:14,899
development so I really strongly

323
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:17,219
recommend to think about the existing

324
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:19,620
possibilities which are legal which are

325
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,360
clear which are accessible and maybe why

326
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,639
all your companies are presently on the

327
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,339
market here is to be in a system which

328
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:29,480
is reimbursing a very important medical

329
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:32,880
treat which has an unbelievable

330
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:36,000
yeah opportunity for unmet medical need

331
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:38,220
in more than 44 diseases which are

332
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,440
presently defined may I just ask a

333
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,940
question as well oh please okay I'm

334
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:46,500
happy to do so what why do you say that

335
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:49,320
removing cannabis from the narcotics act

336
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,539
might have implications for doctors not

337
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,920
prescribing it or prescribing because

338
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,599
they are not on the prescription list

339
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:57,240
anymore

340
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,519
prescript which prescription list

341
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,100
how do you think that drugs come on up

342
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,320
we have over the I don't want to go too

343
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,000
deep into Pharma which is my background

344
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,860
but they are over-the-counter product

345
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,539
which are not reimbursed they are

346
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,000
menstrual preparations which are not

347
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:15,059
reimbursed and then we have products

348
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,399
which are by legislation reimbursed and

349
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:19,319
they said for example narcotics and as

350
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,240
cannabis is not yet a marketing

351
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,600
authorization process which went through

352
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,159
the GBA to be listed in the prescription

353
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,278
I don't understand under which kind of

354
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:32,879
status it will be reimbursed then

355
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:36,000
okay interesting uh what do you think of

356
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:38,458
this conflict between dried flowers and

357
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,278
finished products uh what's your point

358
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:44,278
on on that I think that dried flowers

359
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:46,919
had an absolute absolute

360
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:49,139
um authorization to be on the market I

361
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:52,139
have spoken with so many doctors who

362
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:55,440
were so delighted to have a quick

363
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:58,198
reaction medication against heavy pains

364
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,720
and this is not comparable to anything

365
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:02,879
what is presently on the market I just

366
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,560
take one sample cluster headache I don't

367
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,360
know if anybody had heard about it but

368
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:09,659
this is something as soon as it starts

369
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:12,060
people are ready to commit suicide and

370
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:13,980
there's no medication who is stopping

371
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:16,979
this kind of heavy pain and I think we

372
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:19,860
have about three million people who with

373
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,480
heavy pain and we have uh percentage I

374
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:24,539
can recommend to you University of

375
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,500
essence here in the lead for magistra

376
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:33,480
for this cluster headache with a big

377
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:35,940
reach through Germany and the wave of of

378
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,800
flowers is giving during minutes of

379
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,720
relief and this is the first time they

380
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:42,059
receive a medication which is working so

381
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,459
quick and I'm sure there's also another

382
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:46,319
one which we did not have and

383
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:48,778
unfortunately we are missing data but I

384
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,760
think it is pretty clear having such a

385
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:53,159
long prohibition time that we cannot

386
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:55,620
generate data so quickly but this is

387
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:58,439
what I see also as our task is to speak

388
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,879
to Regulators to find a way like we

389
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,699
found it for all other medical

390
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:05,338
challenges a kind of registration path

391
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:07,620
which enables you to bring a product as

392
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,720
quickly on the market maybe a marketing

393
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,360
authorization and a condition and maybe

394
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,459
it was a patient registry and we are in

395
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,259
discussion with several Regulators who

396
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:18,958
are really listening to such kind of

397
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:20,639
proposals but also not to forget a

398
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,979
commercial part is to have some kind of

399
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,620
data safety which allows you not to be

400
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,839
replicated so I'm understanding being

401
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:30,000
here a few days and uh also that

402
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,060
sometimes you are you are desperate

403
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,679
about difficulties but maybe you you may

404
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:37,319
take it also as a chance but everything

405
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:38,879
which is difficult is not impossible and

406
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,100
everything which is not impossible is

407
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,320
reachable it's a strategy and it's a

408
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,879
strategy of your self-protection and

409
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,620
make it it for competition may be a

410
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,139
little bit difficult and you might find

411
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:51,778
yourself in a niche as Pharma does it

412
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:53,940
and you might say oh what have I to do

413
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:56,039
with Pharma but you are Pharma you

414
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,440
produce Pharmaceuticals you are in

415
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:01,198
Pharma welcome you in a business which

416
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,480
is so wonderful to treat patients to

417
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:05,399
have this wonderful experience to be

418
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,259
part of the sealing system and maybe one

419
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,640
day of you everybody of us will be

420
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:11,039
patient and will be very grateful for

421
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,799
this options and I spoke with doctors

422
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:16,859
they are very happy to have more options

423
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:19,078
in their toolbox to treat patients so I

424
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:21,240
do not see resistance against flowers

425
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:23,818
well what do you think of these cannabis

426
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,338
clinics coming up coming online here in

427
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:30,599
Germany is that something you support

428
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:34,918
with your organization or well I think

429
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:37,439
that presently the German clinical acts

430
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:40,740
are very clear about what they consider

431
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,259
clinics and we have the full provision

432
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:46,140
Etc so I think

433
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:48,480
um yeah um I I will not put a statement

434
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:51,419
on that I know too few about the

435
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:55,079
processes and how they work on that but

436
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:56,640
I think that talking to Regulators it is

437
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:57,798
also seen critical

438
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:03,120
okay

439
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:07,859
Daniel the Switzerland has a timely uh

440
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:11,699
is a timely ahead of us in in Germany

441
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:13,199
in terms of model projects so we're

442
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,298
talking about we're thinking about

443
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,600
introducing motor production in Germany

444
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:21,538
please tell us how long did that last

445
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:23,399
did that take from the first day of the

446
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:26,038
decision of let's have a model projects

447
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,538
until they really became implemented in

448
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:30,839
Switzerland and what can Germany May

449
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:34,679
learn from learn from your experiences

450
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:37,439
so much well no in fact it's it's funny

451
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:39,720
because we've been watching very closely

452
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,240
what's happening in Germany for a month

453
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,000
now and it was quite a disappointment to

454
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,319
see in which direction it goes and and

455
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,640
especially the opening up of

456
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:49,678
recreational markets so we understand

457
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,740
there's going to be two tiers the second

458
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,419
tier here in Germany is what we already

459
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,440
implemented in Switzerland it started I

460
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:58,020
would say

461
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,080
around 2017

462
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:04,859
when the federal committee for addiction

463
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:07,379
issues issued a report claiming and

464
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:09,479
rightly so that drug policy in

465
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,660
Switzerland has failed period

466
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:15,000
and they took for example particle as a

467
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:17,160
model and and other countries where

468
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,679
there is a more open approach to

469
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,360
narcotics in general and that led to two

470
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,480
movements on the one hand

471
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:26,519
a medical cannabis was was opened up

472
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,558
further and last year was implemented

473
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:30,538
the change in law whereby every doctor

474
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:33,000
now can prescribe medical cannabis you

475
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:34,980
no longer need a special permit from the

476
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,960
federal Office of Public Health so

477
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,579
that's one thing we all know the issues

478
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,019
doctors don't prescribe it they don't

479
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:41,939
know how their all these issues are

480
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:43,798
there in Switzerland as well but we hope

481
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,500
it's going to change soon and there's

482
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:49,139
more and more Creative Solutions to

483
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,599
tackle that on the other hand

484
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:54,059
there's a movement that opened up and

485
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:55,678
and the realization of politicians that

486
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:57,178
they need to do something about this

487
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,720
recreational Market in Switzerland

488
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:03,720
there's a give or take 300 to 500 000

489
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,700
depending who you ask regular cannabis

490
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,519
consumers for

491
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:11,038
of which a hundred thousand claim they

492
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:14,460
take it for medical purposes and of

493
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:16,379
which 200 to 400 take it for

494
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,000
um are consuming for recreational

495
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,559
purposes and that's a lot if you

496
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,480
consider that the entire population is

497
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:25,019
eight or nine million so really we're a

498
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:27,360
population where cannabis is very

499
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:30,119
um pervasive throughout the society and

500
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:32,819
and also I would say relatively open

501
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:35,359
we've had we have held already in the

502
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:38,939
90s we've had a very open market

503
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:42,439
circumvention of certain laws where uh

504
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:45,419
people were able to buy cannabis in in

505
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:48,298
scented bags okay so you would buy this

506
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:50,038
scented bag in in in in in a shop

507
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:51,779
perfectly open you would ask which

508
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:54,660
strain and you would buy it for 100

509
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:56,879
bucks you would buy a little bag and

510
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:01,259
people were looking at them

511
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,179
openly long story short it's really only

512
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:06,779
since about one and a half two years

513
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:09,120
that the law has been enacted and it led

514
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:12,720
to a change in the narcotics act and let

515
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:14,519
me read you now quickly what it says and

516
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,440
what the framework is and from that I'll

517
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:18,660
give you some more flavor so after

518
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,240
Consulting the cantons and communes we

519
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:23,160
have cantons concerned the federal of

520
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,079
the health Ministry May authorize

521
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,940
scientific pilot trials involving

522
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:28,918
narcotics containing an effective

523
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,720
concentration of cannabinoids

524
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:32,159
what that means I will tell you in a

525
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,919
minute

526
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,679
a that are limited in terms of location

527
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:41,038
time and subject matter that allow

528
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,780
findings to to be made on the impact of

529
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,759
new regulations on the use of these

530
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:47,519
narcotics for non-medical purposes and

531
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:49,259
on the health of participants that are

532
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,839
conducted so as to ensure that the

533
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:53,220
protection of health and of minors and

534
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:54,538
the protection of public order and

535
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,519
Public Safety

536
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:59,700
and in which if possible cannabis

537
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:02,339
products are used that are Swiss origin

538
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:04,380
and that comply with the rules of Swiss

539
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:07,319
organic farming

540
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:10,200
so there are certain limitations here as

541
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:12,000
you see one of the limitation is

542
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,360
location has to be limited to certain

543
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,099
municipality it cannot go and and be

544
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:19,979
over all of Switzerland that's not

545
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:22,379
possible time is five years plus an

546
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:25,380
option for an extension of two years

547
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:27,600
subject matter has to be clearly within

548
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:30,299
a scientific scope

549
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:33,119
and usually in the context of and with

550
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:35,879
the support of a research Institution

551
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,558
so it's not an easy quick fix it's not

552
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,419
such a quick thing to just say we're

553
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:41,519
gonna do a pilot project you need to

554
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:43,620
have money you have to finance a

555
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:45,720
scientific study

556
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:47,219
um and usually it's quite capital and

557
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,380
time intensive so I wouldn't

558
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,900
underestimate how complicated it is and

559
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:54,179
everybody here in Germany that's what

560
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,460
you could learn from us maybe is if

561
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:58,980
you're interested to to conduct such a

562
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,900
study don't wait until pillar two falls

563
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,240
into place come to Switzerland and see

564
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,320
how it already works and get you know do

565
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,900
your homework

566
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:09,480
then

567
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:13,080
findings to be made well again the scope

568
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:16,319
has to be defined the idea is to to

569
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:18,480
analyze Health psychological health

570
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:19,259
physical health

571
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,220
um

572
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:24,599
in addition to that consumer

573
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:28,500
behavior is one thing that is being

574
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:30,538
analyzed youth protection all these

575
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:34,619
things just Define your scope very

576
00:23:30,538 --> 00:23:36,720
clearly and then you may able to to

577
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:38,279
um to proceed with that and in the end

578
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,919
the way the way it works now there's

579
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:43,399
five or six different model projects

580
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:47,759
that already have been

581
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:51,059
approved and are getting into motion now

582
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:54,000
the first one was in Basel and it's a

583
00:23:51,058 --> 00:23:57,000
dispensary in the pharmacy so patients

584
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,038
can sign up to the study it's a few

585
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,659
hundred people we were always concerned

586
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,179
because many of these people they have

587
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:05,460
to give their name their address they

588
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:07,140
have to report back on a regular basis

589
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,298
there's data being collected on these

590
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:12,179
people and we always said before me

591
00:24:09,298 --> 00:24:14,460
including I was completely wrong that

592
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:16,679
people will not do it people already are

593
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:19,019
that cannabis readily available they can

594
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:21,538
buy why sign up for this and go all this

595
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:24,000
length and the reality is that it was

596
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:25,740
pretty much sold out you know in a few

597
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,019
days it was just filled no problem

598
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:31,919
everybody wouldn't and the main reason

599
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:34,740
for that is that people want to get a

600
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:38,038
clean product there's an excellent track

601
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:40,980
and Trace solution that is implemented

602
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:43,619
in Switzerland in in conjunction with uh

603
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,779
with a privately held company that one

604
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:49,918
attender from the Ministry of Health

605
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:52,259
essentially to conduct try can trace so

606
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,179
it's very transparent

607
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:55,500
and one of the biggest issues in

608
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:57,480
Switzerland today is that you have

609
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,798
cannabis products out there and cannabis

610
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,620
is probably one of the most dangerous

611
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:05,759
drugs period in the market today because

612
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:08,819
a lot of it is spiced up and has

613
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:11,038
synthetic cannabinoids and synthetic THC

614
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:13,079
and is incredibly potent and people

615
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:16,079
don't know what they're buying so the

616
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:18,899
interest was really really there to to

617
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:21,538
get access to these to these trials and

618
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:25,460
we're all now waiting for the Zurich

619
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:27,379
trial to commence where we have uh 21

620
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,940
points of sale

621
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:32,159
including 10 pharmacies and 10 Social

622
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,380
Clubs so let's see how that rolls out

623
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:38,340
greatly thank you yeah that's what we

624
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:40,200
all fearing that we have these model

625
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:42,538
projects implemented within the next

626
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,480
five years until we have designed

627
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:48,179
defined the study design the financing

628
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,220
security Etc and then another five years

629
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:51,960
evaluation period so maybe there will be

630
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:54,480
a legalization in Germany in the next

631
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,840
decade may I just add one thing to that

632
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,400
the model projects are just one layer

633
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,839
there's another layer in Switzerland

634
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,400
that is going on which is on the

635
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:04,798
political Arena because there was a

636
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,820
parliamentary initiative in parallel

637
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:10,379
that has been launched and the the

638
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:13,259
essentially the parliament or the the

639
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:16,320
health commissions that are relevant in

640
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:18,240
the context already approved a full

641
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,639
legalization

642
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,079
of cannabis in Switzerland okay that

643
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,360
doesn't mean that it's going to happen

644
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,038
very soon but it does mean that since I

645
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:28,319
know you mentioned this initiative and

646
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:30,658
nothing's happening well well there is a

647
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:33,778
subcommittee now in Switzerland that is

648
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:35,460
actually already working on drafting the

649
00:26:33,778 --> 00:26:37,380
legislation together obviously with the

650
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,659
federal Office of Public Health

651
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,278
and I very much hope that they're

652
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:43,140
looking at Germany

653
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:46,980
and that they say we can be a bit more

654
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:49,799
courageous than that good

655
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:53,579
Bob you you heard that no commercial

656
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:56,519
route in Germany why did you still come

657
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:58,798
that's a great question no I Germany

658
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:01,259
needs to be comfortable with a medical

659
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:04,740
system that has elements of a commercial

660
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:07,259
adult use system that's a fact you have

661
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,720
to use from a commercial standpoint and

662
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:11,879
let's face it we are all about having

663
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,278
access to patients we're all about a

664
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,980
medical framework here but for

665
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:18,900
businesses to survive what has to happen

666
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,240
you guys know the answer to this

667
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,580
question for a business to survive there

668
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,558
has to be an economic model for there to

669
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:28,918
be an economic model you need to have

670
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:30,960
purchasers on a regular basis for all of

671
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:33,960
the wears that come out of all of the

672
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,819
expensive infrastructure so Germany

673
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,579
needs to get comfortable with this

674
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:41,879
notion that it's going to have a medical

675
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:44,519
model that is slippery you know what I

676
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:48,000
mean by slippery meaning it that it is

677
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:51,658
in certain ways masquerading as an adult

678
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,659
use program and that's okay it doesn't

679
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:56,460
have to be called adult use for us to be

680
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:59,580
comfortable with it have giving adult

681
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:02,278
use elements it just has to be legal and

682
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:04,740
regulated so that the purchaser is

683
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:07,140
buying something that's consistent and

684
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:10,200
quality driven that's the most important

685
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:12,419
point and my U.S perspective is Tainted

686
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,940
a bit because that's how it started in

687
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:18,240
the United States in Most states right

688
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:21,659
Look at California as a Pioneer look at

689
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:25,259
Oregon Colorado where I call home

690
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:27,840
Colorado once we had 100

691
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:32,278
000 patients registered in a medical

692
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:35,819
marijuana program it was Game Over It

693
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:39,179
was a commercial regulated system we

694
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:41,819
have in Colorado what we call a severe

695
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:43,740
pain catch-all meaning if I have a

696
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:47,158
migraine you talk about the cluster

697
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:49,679
headaches if I have back pain I qualify

698
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:51,778
to purchase as much cannabis as I'm

699
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,179
lawfully allowed to purchase

700
00:28:51,778 --> 00:28:55,919
that opened the floodgates because I

701
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:59,278
didn't really have to have a technical

702
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,860
medical condition I just had to have an

703
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:05,519
experience of pain validated by a

704
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:06,479
physician well if I wanted to game the

705
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,158
system

706
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,038
if I wanted to go to a doctor and say

707
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,919
Doc my back hurts can you give me a card

708
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:16,500
to let me purchase cannabis nine out of

709
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,320
10 times a doctor's going to do that so

710
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,659
the system became a bit strained but

711
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:24,359
what did it do it created the financial

712
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:27,120
and economic legs underneath of it which

713
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:29,158
were necessary for it to survive you

714
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,319
can't just start a system have everybody

715
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:33,960
line up at the start line build

716
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:36,960
infrastructure and then give a trickle

717
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:40,980
of patience to the existing system that

718
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:43,259
needs patients consumer dollars so I'm

719
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,659
also a bit jaded Kai in that medical

720
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:48,419
marijuana in the United States doesn't

721
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:50,700
really mean medicine

722
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:52,440
that doesn't mean that there's not a

723
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,880
medicinal benefit to cannabinoids we all

724
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,340
know that's true I hope we all know

725
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:59,278
that's true that's why we're here it

726
00:29:56,339 --> 00:30:02,158
just means that the purchaser has to

727
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:05,278
qualify under a condition

728
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,620
it just qualifies the purchaser another

729
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:10,319
way to qualify the purchaser is to say

730
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:13,319
You must be 21 years old or over it's

731
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:16,379
the exact same thing so medical cannabis

732
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:19,980
in the U.S simply means safe consistent

733
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:22,140
access to cannabis for whatever reason I

734
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:24,480
should choose to use it and I think

735
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,980
that's the notion that that we need to

736
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,740
get comfortable with particularly here

737
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:31,380
in Germany it's a fascinating experiment

738
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:33,538
guy and that's why I'm here is to see it

739
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,220
happen in real time obviously to to hang

740
00:30:33,538 --> 00:30:37,319
out and see great friends and to see

741
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:40,319
what's happening because it happens

742
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:42,000
uniquely country by country two other

743
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,099
points I'd like to make quickly and that

744
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,119
is you have to understand a

745
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:51,240
jurisdiction's why the reason that the

746
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:54,319
jurisdiction legalizes cannabis it's

747
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:56,720
critical because not any jurisdiction

748
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:59,759
legalizes it for the same purpose

749
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,100
sometimes it's for adult use sometimes

750
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,519
it's Criminal Justice Reform so

751
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:07,079
sometimes it's Social Justice Reform

752
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:10,259
sometimes it's because you need an

753
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:12,058
economic driver you need job creations

754
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:13,679
don't look at any of those reasons and

755
00:31:12,058 --> 00:31:15,778
go oh that's not why we're doing it and

756
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,298
look down on it it doesn't matter what

757
00:31:15,778 --> 00:31:20,640
you think it matters what the sentiment

758
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:22,619
is in that jurisdiction so you have to

759
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,778
understand that and then the last thing

760
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:26,639
I'll note

761
00:31:23,778 --> 00:31:29,940
at least now is there's really four

762
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:33,240
models for cannabis legalization there's

763
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:35,940
four policy Lanes they exist already we

764
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:39,120
don't need to invent them there's the

765
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:41,880
industrial Lane speaks for itself the

766
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:45,599
second lane FDA or the equivalent

767
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,419
approved formulations Pharma

768
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,558
the third lane

769
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:51,360
nutraceutical products Products that

770
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:53,038
come from the cannabis plant that are

771
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:55,979
for health-based purposes that don't

772
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:57,480
produce an intoxicating effect the

773
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:00,599
fourth Lane

774
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:04,500
OTC you understand OTC over the counter

775
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:06,418
OTC cannabis in Germany you mix all

776
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:09,079
three of the last ones that's not

777
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:12,000
sustainable you can't mix

778
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:14,639
over-the-counter cannabis FDA approved

779
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,859
medicines and nutraceuticals they have

780
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,038
to be separated because the systems

781
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:22,079
already exist policy makers bureaucrats

782
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:24,658
business owners are used to those three

783
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:26,819
lanes existing independently right now

784
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:29,220
you throw them all together under the

785
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:31,319
guise of medical and maybe just a little

786
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:34,079
bit with this social club experiment

787
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:37,259
that's coming that it begins to open up

788
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:40,678
that OTC Lane just a little bit just

789
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:43,500
enough so that's the future not because

790
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:45,240
I say it but I think it matters that

791
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,980
it's coming from a lawyer because we're

792
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,220
trying aim to respect and understand

793
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:53,278
existing policy Frameworks those

794
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:55,500
Frameworks exist already stop trying to

795
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:58,200
reinvent the wheel

796
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,519
thank you Bob thank you

797
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,220
hmm

798
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,619
so what I take away from this is the the

799
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:07,259
medical cannabis Market in the US where

800
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:10,619
the facilitator uh facilitating the

801
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:13,798
recreational Market uh in fact and you

802
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:16,139
had also like model projects or Social

803
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:18,720
Clubs did they play any role in in the

804
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:21,000
US in in the during the legalization we

805
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,159
should answer please we still struggle

806
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,159
in the U.S with this idea of consumption

807
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:27,539
uh where to consume Social Clubs uh you

808
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,059
know having an element of consumption

809
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:32,278
allowance we don't we don't really

810
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:33,898
Embrace that in the United States we're

811
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:36,839
starting to get around our heads around

812
00:33:33,898 --> 00:33:39,058
that uh Nevada Las Vegas will be an

813
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:42,240
interesting interesting way to see how

814
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:44,339
this evolves other states have evolved a

815
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,159
little bit but the social club model is

816
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:50,879
not something that's uh really in Vogue

817
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:52,919
and and really not understood uh policy

818
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,440
makers want to legalize it but they want

819
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:59,278
a very tightly controlled supply chain

820
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:01,980
down to the consumer who does what pays

821
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:04,819
tax tax money that's all the governments

822
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:07,500
care about got it yeah yeah

823
00:34:04,819 --> 00:34:09,480
Michael we have one minute left for uh

824
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,639
or is it the panel over soon one

825
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,780
question if possible please and then

826
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:15,838
we're over

827

Newman and everybody first of all

829
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,179
we have time for a quick question not a

830
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:26,699
long history of your personal use with

831
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:28,800
cannabis before you discovered just one

832
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:30,539
anybody have one quick question there

833
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,399

834
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:34,019

835
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:35,519

836
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:37,559

837
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,838
he's wearing the comfortable shoes look

838
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:42,179
how his hair bounces in the wind yeah

839
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:44,279
thanks uh just a very quick question

840
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:47,159
um how do you think uh especially in

841
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,560
Germany and Europe will we go into the

842
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:53,820
direction of clinical trials as

843
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:57,000
currently in Germany uh cannabis is an

844
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,599
unlicensed medicine so will we get

845
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,239
um

846
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:03,240
cannabis flowers that have an Mah a

847
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:04,919
marketing authorization or will there be

848
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:07,319
different models maybe using

849
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:10,200
observational data real world evidence

850
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:14,539
or like a shortcut or will it just stay

851
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:14,539
as it is at the moment to be unlicensed

852
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:19,740
yeah I think for flowers it will be

853
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:21,119
difficult because they are not

854
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:22,379
protectable and there are so many

855
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,480
flowers right now in the German Market

856
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,579
that's really difficult to get a group

857
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,940
of patients together to really get some

858
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:31,920
data data which will talk for itself for

859
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,780
extracts I think it is different

860
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,579
um there you have a bit more of

861
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,960
differentiation and then now there are

862
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:38,820
already some studies going on and there

863
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,338
will be more studies going on to gather

864
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:45,300
data and show exactly what effect has it

865
00:35:41,338 --> 00:35:46,799
for patients in different indications

866
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,260
thank you

867
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,720
I would add to that that there's never

868
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:53,820
anything which is impossible

869
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:56,118
um in my Korean Pharma we started like

870
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:59,640
medical gases impossible to register

871
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:01,500
biological is impossible to register uh

872
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:03,838
I can name a few other parts at the end

873
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,119
they have been registered there is the

874
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:08,699
correlation proof of concept in a

875
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:10,800
product so the indication and the

876
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:13,799
product has to fit and if you have here

877
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,539
proof of concept then Happy Days and

878
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,660
once I want just one to say one

879
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:20,940
something or to add before my pizza

880
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:23,159
seller says you can make the best pizza

881
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:25,440
in town but if nobody knows you will not

882
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:28,679
sell one piece and maybe you think about

883
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,500
here about the situation in Germany so

884
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:34,799
if not the doctors are not knowing what

885
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,059
you have they will not prescribe it and

886
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,760
I think there are a lot of wonderful

887
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:40,440
models who do a perfect job on that so

888
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,839
if you look for that I think you will

889
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:45,539
find your way and a very successful high

890
00:36:42,838 --> 00:36:47,460
margin way to be in the market

891
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:51,619
thank you all so very much that was

892
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,619
fantastic one more time foreign
