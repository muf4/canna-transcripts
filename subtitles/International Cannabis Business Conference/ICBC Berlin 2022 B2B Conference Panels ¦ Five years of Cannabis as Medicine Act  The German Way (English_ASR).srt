1
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,678
what i'm going to do with you in the

2
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,239
next couple of minutes is i'm gonna

3
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,480
discuss with you what happened the last

4
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,640
five years regarding

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,640
this

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,240
what are the challenges

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,800
what are the pitfalls

8
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:31,919
and of course we're going to discuss

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,399
also

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,719
a little bit more in detail

11
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,039
what will be the future with regard to

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,399
the recreation market at least from my

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,119
point of view

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,039
which is the point of view of a lawyer

15
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,799
who is involved in the business since

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,439
2016

17
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:52,959
i'm in the life sciences field for over

18
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:55,198
20 years 30 years contractors

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,799
and before i came here this morning i

20
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:01,198
had a radio interview with uh

21
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:04,239
attorney broadcaster

22
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,560
and the interviewer surprised me with

23
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,840
the following question

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,000
peter

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,960
we have a look we have a look at your at

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,840
the dentist's home page and we found the

27
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:18,158
following slogan

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,359
however you need to grow

29
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,359
then this is here to help

30
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,240
do you take that

31
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:27,280
and frankie speaker and now our

32
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,680
marketing people

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,960
but to a certain extent no surprise

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,520
because i didn't

35
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,399
know about that's wrong anyway

36
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,798
so

37
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,240
i try to answer that a little bit more

38
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,600
in detail and what we're going to do

39
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,719
right now and here's how the german

40
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,319
speaker usually presents the agenda

41
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,560
an overview of it

42
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,078
about the historical facts very briefly

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,399
because you all know what happened in

44
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,919
germany in the last five years how we

45
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,359
actually develop

46
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,960
the medical market for for cannabis

47
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,040
we're looking into the liberalization

48
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:02,319
process some milestones tell me very

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,719
quickly some some really headlines what

50
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,879
has happened in these five years to the

51
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,679
german market now we talked about the

52
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,598
pitfalls the market situation coming to

53
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,920
canada is as of today and how we

54
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:17,039
developed over the last couple of years

55
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,119
and then we come to the you are all

56
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,840
uh very very interested in the

57
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,480
liberalization

58
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,959
process for regulation cannabis in

59
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,959
germany

60
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,598
so if we look into

61
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,598
[Music]

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,840
the timeline

63
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,280
you see that we have actually

64
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,200
deliverization in 2017

65
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,280
uh in march

66
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,039
the decision of the federal

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,400
administrative portuguese triggered the

68
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,560
liberalization

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,159
was in 2016 and

70
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,680
of course then

71
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,598
we had a

72
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,800
whole concept of

73
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:58,639
a legal environment building up

74
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,360
regulatory frameworks for the respective

75
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,839
medical cannabis products

76
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,319
in april

77
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,000
2019 the federal institute for drugs and

78
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:11,039
medical advice which is the way farm

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,800
which you all know actually granted them

80
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:18,479
three licenses to

81
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:21,120
german cultivators which we all know of

82
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:24,000
with a very limited extent to cultivate

83
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,640
cannabis in germany it's 10.6

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,759
metric tons over the period of five

85
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,238
years

86
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,560
which is by far not enough to serve the

87
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,360
market as you can see later on in my

88
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,719
presentation but at least it is a step

89
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,319
forward

90
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:42,158
the question is of course why only 10.6

91
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:45,679
tons for four years

92
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:48,079
well the bee farm is actually purchasing

93
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,920
the flowers from the three

94
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,519
licensed producers

95
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,000
and selling it directly to the

96
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,319
pharmacists of course they are not using

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,280
own warehouses they have used an

98
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:01,598
appointed kansathima to do that for the

99
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,000
big farm but they have been extremely

100
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,479
conservative with regard to what is

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,680
actually the amount the quantity which

102
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,719
will be needed for the medical market

103
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,200
it is

104
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,680
definitely less than what the market

105
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,279
needs and of course germany will remain

106
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,319
one of the largest

107
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:23,198
importers for medical economies in the

108
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:25,759
next years as well

109
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,680
i'd like to make just a very brief

110
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,000
discourse here

111
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,519
which is a decision

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,160
of the

113
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,560
european court of justice

114
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,720
of november 2020.

115
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,040
it doesn't really have to do with the

116
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,199
medical cannabis market because it was a

117
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,600
cbd

118
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,639
and the european court of justice

119
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,879
actually

120
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,918
classified cbd

121
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,560
as

122
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:56,478
not being a narcotic

123
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,478
this has now to be implemented in the

124
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,720
but i think it's a big step forward

125
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,639
into

126
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,039
the legalization

127
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,759
of cannabis and cannabis related

128
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:10,240
products such i have mentioned that here

129
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,400
we will come back to that in a minute at

130
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,759
the end of my presentation

131
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,359
let's have a look into the milestones

132
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,860
which we have seen

133
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,600
in the last five years

134
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,120
[Music]

135
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,240
now these are the

136
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,240
rebate contracts

137
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,639
rebate contracts

138
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,038
what are rebate contracts

139
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,960
pharmaceutical manufacturers and what's

140
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,360
common in germany

141
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:46,319
ground helps ensure certain remains for

142
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,199
dispensing and then expands and in

143
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,959
return get an exclusivity being the

144
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,759
supplier for these

145
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,279
uh health insurance companies what you

146
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,080
have to know

147
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,758
is

148
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,279
once a patient

149
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,280
has a right

150
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,719
with the brand of disposition for

151
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:06,639
reimbursement of the respective

152
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,730
treatment

153
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,729
[Music]

154
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,079
and as such the health insurance

155
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,479
companies having of course a very close

156
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,879
look into the expenses of these

157
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,680
respective treatments

158
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,519
so what has happened here

159
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,240
as at the beginning of

160
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,478
the

161
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,478
liberalization and you may

162
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:40,318
know that

163
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:45,120
the price on a paragraph basis in 2017

164
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:47,520
and 2080 was around 22 euros

165
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,160
for the patient

166
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,799
was around 10 to 12 euros from the

167
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,199
wholesaler to the pharmacy

168
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,280
and then the pharmacy had to

169
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:03,360
add a hundred percent surcharge

170
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:05,359
why because the product was qualified as

171
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,120
an extendress mixture and helped as a

172
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,080
ready-made pharmaceutical

173
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,240
with the consequence the price up

174
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,079
and that was of course an issue with the

175
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,319
respect of health insurance companies

176
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,079
and the association of health insurance

177
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,319
companies and the associations of

178
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:23,120
pharmacists have actually found the

179
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,960
solution they have kept the price from

180
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,720
the wholesaler to the pharmacy at 950 to

181
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,478
the euros

182
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,479
per day

183
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,159
now the surcharge applies and of course

184
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,000
there's a staggering process the

185
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,919
surcharge will decline very much

186
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,598
depending on the quantity of the

187
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,639
prescription

188
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:45,120
so that was the first time the real

189
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,280
price regulation mechanism

190
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,680
has entered the market here

191
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,198
what happened what happened as well

192
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,598
was that

193
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,598
due to the competition in the market the

194
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:58,478
price really went down on a per gram

195
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:01,598
basis from this 952 to

196
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:04,399
six seven euros very programmed even

197
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:06,000
below that over time for the medicinal

198
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:08,478
market

199
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,639
and then of course the health insurance

200
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,240
companies had the idea why don't we

201
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,240
apply the same system which you have

202
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,160
already made pharmaceuticals

203
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,160
also to the extent horrendous mixtures

204
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,080
being catalysts

205
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,879
that's why these remained contracts

206
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,240
actually came into force and of course

207
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,160
there are

208
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,560
some companies who have entered into

209
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,879
these rebate contracts with the

210
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,278
respective health insurance companies

211
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:38,000
and others may also join because these

212
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:38,000
are so-called open house contracts

213
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,838
another

214
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:48,080
milestone was the application of the

215
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,080
so-called amwat fault in canada

216
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:55,359
we are talking here about the

217
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,839
possibility of humiliation of the plants

218
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,800
in order to significantly reduce the

219
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,800
microbiology

220
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,278
in 2019 one of our clients has asked

221
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,600
what do i have to do

222
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,679
how can i actually import irradiated

223
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,440
cannabis flowers from canada into

224
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,159
germany so he went through the waveform

225
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,399
and says okay what should we do

226
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,159
if i actually said well you just find

227
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,240
the application for the importation

228
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:23,039
license for the specific lot with your

229
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,519
local authority or just mention that it

230
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:29,360
is irritated which we did

231
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,720
client actually imported in 2019 at 2018

232
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,480
this

233
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,160
cannabis irrigated talents was in

234
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,959
germany

235
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,399
all of a sudden in 2019 the bay farm

236
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:42,000
actually decided

237
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:44,240
well i think we have to grant a

238
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,399
specific license under the outlet file

239
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,879
which is the respective lawyer

240
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,879
um for the irradiation of the cannabis

241
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,360
which was totally new if you look into

242
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,838
the respective legislation to the

243
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,399
respective law it is capable for

244
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,440
regulators

245
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,440
not for extemporaneous mixtures well it

246
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,440
was actually applied one to one by the

247
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,839
bay farm everybody applied for it and

248
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,160
then of course the respective

249
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,640
licenses have been granted

250
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:19,120
what was the reason for it

251
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,799
difficult to say uh hypothetically well

252
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,720
the license is relatively expensive you

253
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,000
have to pay for it but the intention for

254
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,480
each and every product you should like

255
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,480
to report

256
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,838
let's go to the next milestone um

257
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,879
here are the various voices which she

258
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,640
just

259
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:45,360
listed which you need if you would like

260
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,039
to

261
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,000
enter the german market

262
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,919
of course you need to have a

263
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,039
manufacturing permit

264
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:52,479
experiment

265
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:53,838
import permits

266
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,000
uh then you have remotes in the

267
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,600
wholesale license advertising is not

268
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,639
really allowed because it's an economic

269
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,639
it's very very limited

270
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,559
and as i said

271
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:08,720
these

272
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,278
products are extensive

273
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,278
not early

274
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,880
so if you want to do business here

275
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,120
insurance you have to either establish

276
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,838
your own company and apply for these

277
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,360
licenses timeline approximately one six

278
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,880
nine months if you're lucky very much

279
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,480
depending on the local authority where

280
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,360
you are located

281
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,440
or you'll find a company who has already

282
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,399
the existing licenses from the import

283
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,000
and you're going to educate a respected

284
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,360
agreement with them

285
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,240
which is

286
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,000
for most exporters in your best way to

287
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,399
do it if you want to reach the market

288
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,399
quickly

289
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,278
what we are currently discussing

290
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,759
about a bit for are the quality

291
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:51,759
standards

292
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,959
so

293
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,278
this is a

294
00:11:54,958 --> 00:12:01,679
relatively new but very intense

295
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,679
discussion for general companies

296
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
the precondition for importing products

297
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,720
from a company from a country outside of

298
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,480
germany is first of all

299
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,839
that the country

300
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,399
of origin

301
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,279
adheres to the 1961 u.n civil convention

302
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,200
which

303
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,879
stipulates that you have to have a

304
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,360
formal licensing process for the

305
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:27,919
cultivation and the export a controlled

306
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,519
process for the export for medicinal

307
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,319
canals

308
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,240
or for cannabis for scientific purposes

309
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,399
not for recreational i will come back to

310
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,519
that in a minute

311
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,839
once this qualification has been checked

312
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,959
then of course the exporter the

313
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,560
exporting

314
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:49,119
company has to fulfill eu gmp

315
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:52,239
regulations in the process

316
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:57,600
and of course the products have as well

317
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,720
so if you are an exporter from canada

318
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,079
you

319
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,959
may obtain

320
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:05,278
a gmp certificate locally which of

321
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,879
course is not recognized within the

322
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,159
european union of course and by the trip

323
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:09,919
authorities

324
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,000
that means

325
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,559
a german officer from the german

326
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
authorities have tends to do an on-site

327
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:17,199
inspection

328
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,879
in order to

329
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,000
see whether the

330
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:24,320
company in canada qualifies under the eu

331
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,320
gmp regulations

332
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,160
this is not necessary for all those

333
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,480
countries where we have a mutual

334
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,639
recognition agreement in place between

335
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,759
germany and of course the respective

336
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,480
country

337
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:38,879
which folks is for example

338
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,720
applicable for australia

339
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:45,120
any kind of gnp certificate in

340
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:48,320
australian companies

341
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,879
within the european union

342
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,240
what you can see right now here is the

343
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,120
overlap

344
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,079
of gacp and gmp and that's where the

345
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,078
discussion starts

346
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,278
usually

347
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,838
the respective

348
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,360
company the exporter in the third

349
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,880
country

350
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,480
has to

351
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:13,120
adhere to the eu gp regulations

352
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,240
there are treatments right now

353
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,240
that

354
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:21,278
they can actually export gacp

355
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,959
processed flowers for example flowers

356
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,480
into germany

357
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,879
which are then

358
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,278
gnp processed here and then sold to the

359
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,439
drill market

360
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,278
that is as

361
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,440
some of the representatives of these

362
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,360
years companies who are doing it

363
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,920
disruptive

364
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,000
disruptive new idea and the question is

365
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:44,399
is it covered by the respective

366
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,320
and legal framework here so no that's a

367
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,278
good question because we have an overlap

368
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,399
between gacp and gnp and the grayson in

369
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:53,039
between

370
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,919
the pre-drying process is definitely a

371
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:59,360
process which can be done on the pacp

372
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:01,838
a real drying process is of course gm

373
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,278
that must be gnp compliant

374
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,040
and the way from just recently in

375
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,919
connection with a clarification

376
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:09,838
regarding the unrightful permissions has

377
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:13,599
stated that as well

378
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,519
not as clear as we thought it would be

379
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,360
so however we are still in the

380
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,078
discussion whether you can actually

381
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,039
import into drinking or expert oxide

382
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:25,359
gacp presents flowers which are then gnp

383
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,559
processed furniture gp processed via

384
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,360
germany and then sold into the

385
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:32,479
pharmacies which is currently the case

386
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,480
for some employees

387
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,160
let's look into the online trade of

388
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:43,159
medicines

389
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:55,360
[Music]

390
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,078
can you sell

391
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,039
cannabis products online and pharmacies

392
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,879
actually

393
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:12,319
send the product to the respective

394
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:15,519
patient

395
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,920
by career services yes or no

396
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,000
the answer to that is in principle that

397
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:23,120
is possible as it is possible for all

398
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,839
our rx products pharmaceutical products

399
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,240
however you have to adhere to certain

400
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,240
preconditions

401
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,879
first of all the prescription needs to

402
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,839
be sent to the pharmacist you can't send

403
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:37,838
the product with my career to the

404
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,920
patient that careers collecting the

405
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,720
uh prescriptions bring it bring the

406
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:45,360
brings it back to the food pharmacies so

407
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,680
first of all the prescription has to be

408
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,879
sent by the patient to the pharmacy by

409
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:50,479
mail

410
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,159
which is actually the case multiple

411
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,039
other rx products

412
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:57,120
and then the pharmacy can actually send

413
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,278
the product to the patient the patient

414
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,078
does not have to appear in the pharmacy

415
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:03,198
which makes it easier for patients to

416
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:05,599
select

417
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,279
which pharmacy is going to buy his

418
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,119
product which

419
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,599
which has been prescribed by the

420
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,038
physician a very helpful tool and we

421
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,318
have seen that

422
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:16,400
currently

423
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:19,199
a large number of the respective

424
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,240
distribution is done by this online

425
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,720
training

426
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,199
where patients are acting ordering their

427
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,038
products sending the respective

428
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,919
prescriptions to the pharmacies and

429
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:32,160
receiving the package but of course the

430
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,080
career service has to fulfill certain

431
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,320
preconditions you can't send just any

432
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:39,199
bicycle career center with a package of

433
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:41,439
calories to a patient that's clear

434
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,919
but there are of course the

435
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,919
larger

436
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,320
forwarding companies like dhl for

437
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:51,038
example can provide these services

438
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:53,759
knowing what is in the package which is

439
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:53,759
very important

440
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,240
let's come to

441
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:02,719
the market situation currently in

442
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,720
germany

443
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,519
as you see in 2019 the

444
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,279
waveform awarded the contracts for the

445
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:13,519
cultivation

446
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:14,720
respective quality standards have to be

447
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:17,440
adhered

448
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,079
the first harvest by alfrea actually was

449
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,720
done in july 2021 because the small

450
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:24,480
extent was literally kilogram

451
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,160
then the first hundred of demi karma was

452
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,798
100 kilograms

453
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,880
back in april 2022 just recently and of

454
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,679
course and also aurora has made their

455
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,760
first house i was available

456
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:39,519
which is a distributing company

457
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:42,319
for the dfr in may 2022 so it's

458
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:45,038
slightly developing we are not there yet

459
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:46,399
because for various delays which are of

460
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,359
course also

461
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,280
caused by the respective pandemic

462
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,959
which has slowed down cultivation

463
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:57,639
processes

464
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,640
because didn't gather expected materials

465
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,120
which can be exceeded

466
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:12,079
which can be

467
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:14,719
increased by a 10 percent

468
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:14,720
for each

469
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,000
company

470
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:25,798
so where do we stand right now with the

471
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:25,798
medicinal

472
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,960
but if we look into 2017

473
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,519
the actual

474
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,440
the demand estimated by the federal

475
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:39,839
opioid agency was 10.4 tons

476
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,080
of course 2017 was the year that the

477
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:45,599
inauguration took place

478
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:49,839
only 1.77 tons were actually imported

479
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:53,439
2018 it did increase significantly

480
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:56,399
in 2019 of course in 2020 and 2021 i

481
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,038
think that was a significant increase in

482
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,440
2021 we had an import

483
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:04,158
of medical cannabis products of around

484
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,519
20 metric tons

485
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,400
which is

486
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,879
a market the largest market in europe

487
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,280
compared to other markets not in canada

488
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:17,440
or in the us it's relatively still

489
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:19,678
relatively small but not increasing

490
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,640
so the question is of course

491
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,919
where is this market going

492
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,080
i would say

493
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:30,240
we are looking into an increased number

494
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:33,720
of patients if we have a look into the

495
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,720
patient numbers

496
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,200
of the patient numbers

497
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,960
we are

498
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,319
from different sources you see it could

499
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,679
be around

500
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:48,558
80 to 100 000 patients per year

501
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,600
uh within germany which is far less than

502
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:51,599
the initial hopes

503
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,840
that we see

504
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,519
which we are actually uh

505
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,399
one percent

506
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:02,960
of the population which would have been

507
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,559
800 000 patients we probably will not

508
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,880
reach that fear

509
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:09,759
uh but we will have c we would see an

510
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,320
increasing number

511
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,480
and as i said it's currently my father

512
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,000
video creating this market in europe

513
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,679
compared to other markets like the

514
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,679
netherlands poland or italy

515
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,799
so

516
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:29,038
having all said that about the medicine

517
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,558
market which to a certain extent may be

518
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,158
more to you

519
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:34,319
maybe a little bit more now comes the

520
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,480
grief

521
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,319
how are we looking into

522
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,038
the legalization for recreational

523
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:43,359
kindness in germany

524
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:46,240
and let me look into

525
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:48,879
the respective process right now which

526
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,960
we have heard from this degree that is i

527
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,480
would say a relatively early stage

528
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,079
um

529
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,480
currently

530
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:02,000
cannabis is for non-medical purposes is

531
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,880
non-marketable it's a non-marketable

532
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,440
narcotic substance i think that is clear

533
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,880
so we have to change the laws with

534
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,440
respect to the

535
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:16,400
consumption for recreational adult use

536
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,080
what is the market size

537
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,519
that's a very good question we have

538
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:20,879
estimates

539
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,519
who actually

540
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,559
say that the market the illicit market

541
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:26,960
right now

542
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:28,639
is in the duration of 700 metric tons

543
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,440
per year

544
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:35,440
which in comparison to the medical

545
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,440
market is significant

546
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,359
and if you look at how actually the

547
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,919
market

548
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,959
for the liberalization would develop

549
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,240
then

550
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,440
if

551
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:51,359
let's say 50 of the total market

552
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,480
could be served by a regulated

553
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:54,240
market

554
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,798
for recreation recreational purposes we

555
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,440
are talking about 350 metric tons which

556
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:02,879
is significant in comparison to the

557
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,159
current market for medical calories

558
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,080
and as such

559
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,440
the

560
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,599
caution

561
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,640
of the lawmaker

562
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:15,279
in that process is understandable

563
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,840
the original

564
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:20,839
process for the utilization of medicine

565
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:24,158
cannabis wasn't really a

566
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:26,879
masterpiece it was done very quickly

567
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:29,520
we had a lot of grey areas a lot of

568
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,440
unregulated areas as we have seen for

569
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,359
example with the irrigation process but

570
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,159
other processes as well

571
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:37,439
and now the lawmaker would like to make

572
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,520
it right

573
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,200
and there is a certain reluctancy to

574
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:44,079
speed it up

575
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,640
of course the demand is there the black

576
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:50,720
market in this market is there as well

577
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,720
there are there is a danger for

578
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:05,000
[Music]

579
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,000
so what is the timeline

580
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,839
now in may probably autograph the

581
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,119
federal minister for health announced

582
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:15,759
the plan that the draft law

583
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:18,000
it doesn't say that it will be the law

584
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:20,319
it doesn't say that it has been agreed

585
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,798
by the by the parliament

586
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:24,158
it has been released therefore the draft

587
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:25,759
will

588
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,520
then be

589
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:29,720
forwarded in

590
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:31,679
the second half of

591
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,240
2022

592
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,559
we heard this morning this plan is

593
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,359
already a little bit extended to the

594
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:42,079
beginning of 2023

595
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:45,678
uh probably maybe even

596
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:48,158
at the end of the second quarter 2023

597
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,640
and then of course the whole process

598
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:55,120
starts and of course there's a lawyer i

599
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:58,960
i like to and that was truck here

600
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,959
that's the legislation process

601
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:04,000
then it's not just we put the draft into

602
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,679
the parliament and then we agree on it

603
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,519
and everything is fine

604
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,400
no that's not the case

605
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:13,038
it very much depends of course on the

606
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,840
drafting of the respective

607
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:17,440
legislation

608
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:20,558
we assume

609
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,798
that this is a consent bill

610
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,558
this which means the bundesliga which is

611
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,480
our second checker

612
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:28,960
where the majorities

613
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,440
buy the

614
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,720
chris democrats which is the more

615
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,278
conservative side and very very

616
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,839
critical with regard to globalization

617
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:41,759
has the majority

618
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,199
so that means you may have another

619
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,000
reading

620
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,000
so altogether i would say

621
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,519
that we will not have

622
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,400
a final

623
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:53,359
law

624
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,798
for globalization of cannabis

625
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:59,439
for adult recreational purposes in place

626
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:01,918
before the end of second third or fourth

627
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,080
quarter 2023

628
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,400
that is kind of invention and the

629
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,678
natural process you can't do that

630
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,720
overnight

631
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,559
and then as

632
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,360
we have heard the first draft will be in

633
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:15,839
2023 well then of course this whole

634
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:17,678
process here starts and we will see how

635
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:19,759
quickly that will be done

636
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,960
uh and whether the google start of

637
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:24,720
course is giving its concept yes or no

638
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,480
very much give heads of course and mr

639
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,960
peter brought it out on the discussion

640
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,360
between the various parties uh and how

641
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,679
they actually uh

642
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:36,839
put life to adopt

643
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,840
the liberalization

644
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,159
which i would like to address here as

645
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,159
well

646
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,880
this is a summary of just what i said

647
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,880
um

648
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,120
what is

649
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:18,799
important

650
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,640
are the legal checks

651
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,278
[Music]

652
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,440
the first one is of course

653
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:28,079
germany is part of multiple

654
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,679
international trades and we spoke about

655
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:34,240
that i think through the last icbc event

656
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:37,278
the 1961 unc convention other two

657
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:40,240
conventions are restricting the transfer

658
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:43,359
of narcotics between its member states

659
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,038
over 180 countries have signed off on

660
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:49,439
those streets

661
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:51,839
which means that you cannot just import

662
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,399
cannabis from holland canada or any

663
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:55,759
other country for recreational purposes

664
00:27:54,398 --> 00:28:00,439
you could be

665
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,440
immediately in violation of the 9661ux

666
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:04,639
but what are the theoretical

667
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,640
consequences of that

668
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,320
the international narcotics control

669
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:13,600
board which is the executive control

670
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:16,079
board for the conventions

671
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:18,480
is empowered to monitor the compliance

672
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,480
with the respective conventions

673
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,360
and last but not least they are setting

674
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,240
the quotas for the importation

675
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:28,319
also for medicine economists

676
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,640
so so far there was never a problem that

677
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:31,439
wasn't discussed at all though the day

678
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,799
fund

679
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:38,480
in 2021 actually has increased its

680
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:41,679
demand over the period of time in 2021

681
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,839
and has asked the incb to adopt and to

682
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,440
ground the permission to import the

683
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:47,199
larger amounts which have been

684
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,519
voluntarily

685
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,200
but without the permission of the incb

686
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:54,000
even for the respective medicine

687
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,919
journalists you are not allowed to

688
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,398
import these products

689
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,640
to a certain extent

690
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:02,079
so the practical consequences of a

691
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,278
violation

692
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:05,519
could be

693
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:07,119
that the incp

694
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,720
is going to

695
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:12,639
initiate a reforce mechanism which they

696
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,640
haven't done in the case of canada and

697
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,159
europe who would enter the recreation

698
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,440
park as well

699
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,320
but they are

700
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,919
uh

701
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:22,480
in the position to

702
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,720
reduce the quota also for the medical

703
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,120
terrorist of course

704
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,200
which they haven't done they have not

705
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,918
really reacted so far neither in the

706
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,000
case of canada or uruguay

707
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,520
but we'll see what they

708
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,679
may or may not say

709
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,158
about the

710
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,240
possible cultivation of love of

711
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,480
recreation in germany which was really

712
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,720
one solution that are coming to the back

713
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,278
development

714
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,278
furthermore

715
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:52,319
the shang convention

716
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,798
there is

717
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:01,038
the eu framework

718
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,559
which of course all the universities are

719
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:03,839
probably you know

720
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:05,599
in contract everybody talks about

721
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:08,000
sharing content when it comes to

722
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:10,798
words presentation and

723
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,640
immigration and whatever so we germany

724
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:14,319
if who has

725
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,640
a very small

726
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:18,879
cultivation for medicine economist at

727
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,240
this point in time

728
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,640
can not just without violating the

729
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,798
respective u.n conventions and the

730
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,840
shelling convention

731
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:32,158
import these products into germany

732
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:33,519
won't the government do that

733
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,360
good question

734
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:37,599
i would say they do

735
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:39,278
so we have to find a way

736
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:42,000
to solve that issue

737
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:44,240
which we didn't press this morning

738
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,319
where do we get the calories from for

739
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,558
the recreational market which is a

740
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:51,119
significant market

741
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:52,240
do we do homegrown

742
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:54,479
do we do

743
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,798
cultivation in germany

744
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,720
do we ask the three licensed producers

745
00:30:56,798 --> 00:30:59,599
right now to significantly increase

746
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,919
their

747
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:04,558
their their quantities which they to a

748
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:07,278
certain extent may or may not do are we

749
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:09,678
inviting others to join

750
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:11,519
uh the foundation germany which would be

751
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,519
a possibility to say well we're not

752
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,200
tendering it up no more tankers sorry

753
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,159
the bay frontier was

754
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,519
really very difficult i would say but

755
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,880
invite

756
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,480
for respective

757
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,480
interested parties to cultivate

758
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,640
cannabis for recreational purposes if

759
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,720
they fulfill certain requirements and

760
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,880
get the license you may have seen that

761
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,960
happening in the netherlands where 10

762
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,440
companies have just recently been

763
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,798
granted the permission to part

764
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,120
to grow

765
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:43,278
cannabis for recreational purposes for

766
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:45,199
the domestic use

767
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:46,960
within the netherlands

768
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,038
i see here

769
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,159
one of those solutions

770
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:53,679
other solutions may be of course

771
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,559
the respective

772
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,240
change of the convention well i don't

773
00:31:56,558 --> 00:31:59,759
think that you will get healthy

774
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,960
countries to

775
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:04,879
very quickly agree to a change of that

776
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,679
convention to

777
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,278
terminate the convention step out and

778
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,120
apply again for

779
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:13,119
with the provision that cannabis doesn't

780
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:15,918
come from it doesn't be applicable for

781
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:18,479
germany very difficult you never know

782
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,240
whether the other 180 or 179 countries

783
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,839
would agree to that

784
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,919
which is a possibility theoretically

785
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,439
but the more practical solution

786
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,600
definitely is

787
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,360
either we're talking about homework or

788
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:33,839
we're talking about domestic cultivation

789
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:35,918
and the respective increase then of

790
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:38,319
course we are talking about

791
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,519
end of 2024

792
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:44,240
because you have to do that process

793
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:48,079
despite the fact that you have also to

794
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,919
establish the respective infrastructure

795
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:52,079
in order to have

796
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,759
this

797
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:56,720
cannabis foreign creation purposes

798
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:58,960
distinguished to the

799
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,880
the infrastructure is you know it's

800
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,120
do we have heard about this morning

801
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,000
about licensed shops

802
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:06,079
yeah

803
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,919
so we need somebody who is going to

804
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:10,558
grant the licenses who is going to look

805
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:13,038
and control the respective distribution

806
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:14,960
centers so that is an infrastructure

807
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:17,278
which you have to set up

808
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,120
and that's a significant effort

809
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:22,000
and we should have started that a little

810
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:24,558
bit earlier probably if we would like to

811
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,440
look into the respective

812
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:30,240
results so let's see

813
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,240
her challenges

814
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:38,000
the question is of course how we attract

815
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,000
the problem do we do decriminalization

816
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,798
like an opponent or do we really do

817
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,798
legalization

818
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,720
with the respective

819
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:49,678
not

820
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,679
not enforcement

821
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:53,038
these are the solutions which i just

822
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,119
mentioned

823
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:56,640
the open violation i don't think that

824
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:58,398
the german government is going to try to

825
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,159
violate international treaties

826
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:02,398
immediately as well as the shang

827
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,799
contract

828
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,719
so let's have a look into another issue

829
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:08,719
which we have to

830
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,800
adhere to

831
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:13,279
which is actually the quality of the

832
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,280
product

833
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,919
so

834
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,079
if you look into the recreation market

835
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,319
from my point of view there are three

836
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,599
major factors in order to make a

837
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,159
successor

838
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,000
the first one is pricing

839
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,760
you have to have an adequate cost we

840
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,398
have heard that this morning

841
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,919
when i heard about taxation to a certain

842
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:36,319
extent of course that's an interesting

843
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:38,158
income for the government but it has of

844
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,240
course an impact on the price so prices

845
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,960
are first one secondly

846
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:45,759
is availability

847
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,079
the product needs to be made available

848
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,480
you don't have to should not drive 20 or

849
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,960
25 kilometers to the next dispensary

850
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,398
shop or license shop to get the bot you

851
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,358
would like to buy

852
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:58,159
so

853
00:34:55,358 --> 00:35:02,119
the infrastructure has to be there

854
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:02,118
so product availability

855
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:08,960
and the last one of course is

856
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,680
uh quality

857
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,400
price availability quality should be the

858
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:17,199
other way about this

859
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,200
but i think that's that's the real issue

860
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:21,679
why we have heard this morning for mr

861
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,279
peanut the quality of the black market

862
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:24,960
is

863
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,359
difficult

864
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,400
to say at least there are lots of

865
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:30,159
products

866
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,240
which are mixed with things which are

867
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:34,559
definitely unhealthy

868
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:37,838
and of course that is something which of

869
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:40,239
course we should attack the

870
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:42,880
market but what is the right quality are

871
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:43,838
we going to gmp again

872
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,838
a

873
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:48,639
maybe good question

874
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:50,159
uh it would definitely be an

875
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:52,960
advantage

876
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:55,759
for for the recreational market if you

877
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,838
have the right quality in place

878
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,839
and gmp would be one of those

879
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,200
so if you look into the challenges

880
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,559
this is an example of how the canadian

881
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,400
market actually developed

882
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:16,880
relative to the

883
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,079
medical environment in the market

884
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,079
you see in the medical market

885
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,519
after the respective liberalization it's

886
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:28,799
declined significantly

887
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,280
and

888
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,240
the refugee economies

889
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,599
actually

890
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:37,118
significantly increased

891
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,200
we can't

892
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,200
actually transfer that

893
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:43,358
to germany as well

894
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:45,519
from my point of view and that's a

895
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:47,279
significant

896
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:48,639
issue in the german market you have the

897
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,160
reimbursement

898
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:54,559
patients get reimbursed if they

899
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:57,440
get a prescription

900
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:59,440
now that is not the same to the same

901
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,920
extent happening in canada

902
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,000
so for some patients what was much

903
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,000
easier to go to the recreational market

904
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,519
than who is going to adopt and get the

905
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,400
prescription

906
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:13,199
so what we will definitely see is maybe

907
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:16,960
a slight decline or a kind of a

908
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:18,879
steady line with regard to the

909
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,000
with regard to the

910
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:25,200
medical market and of course then an

911
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,519
increase of the

912
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:30,239
recreation market

913
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:34,639
if we look into the next chart here

914
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:34,639
which is the product price

915
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,838
you see that the product price

916
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,599
uh for the innocent

917
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:46,559
uh market actually went down the legal

918
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,480
adult use market went up

919
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:50,799
and of course the medical market isn't

920
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,800
to a certain steady line that's exactly

921
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,960
what i just mentioned whether this can

922
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,000
be transferred or to go to germany or we

923
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,000
have to be careful with that

924
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,160
so the challenges of the recreational

925
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,280
markets are there we have to work on a

926
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:07,920
number of

927
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,599
issues a number of problems which i

928
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,838
hoped might have been addressed this

929
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,039
morning a little bit more in detail

930
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:18,239
however it looks like that the

931
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:21,279
current discussions are difficult and

932
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:24,078
the current government may not

933
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,480
be in a position to

934
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,640
let us participate in those discussions

935
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,599
in more detail hopefully that will be

936
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:34,960
the case in the near future

937
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,880
before i'm going to end my presentation

938
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,480
by coming back to

939
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:43,119
two slides with regard to the cbd market

940
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,159
which is an interesting market for all

941
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,280
participants in that field as well we

942
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:50,960
have

943
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,320
these three segments for cbd products

944
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,240
cosmetics

945
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,200
which includes

946
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:58,838
the so-called food supplement market and

947
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:00,559
last but not least with our sugar

948
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:02,880
department

949
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:05,599
so the cosmetic market is relatively

950
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,760
easy to enter in comparison to the

951
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,280
secondary market why

952
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,240
the european

953
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,040
commission actually decided

954
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:14,719
that

955
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:16,559
any kind of food supplement which

956
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:19,279
contains cbd

957
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:21,199
is a normal threat and falls under the

958
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,839
normal food

959
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:25,598
convention or directed

960
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:26,799
with a consequence that you have to

961
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,838
apply

962
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,800
for the marketing of these products at

963
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:34,320
the european commission

964
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,480
so the european food and safety

965
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,320
authority is the one who looks into the

966
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,358
respective applications

967
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,838
we have to provide data with regard to

968
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:43,838
the

969
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,760
product it is hardness it doesn't hurt

970
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,000
at all

971
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,200
and that's what a number of companies

972
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,719
did

973
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:54,799
however

974
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:56,719
what happened is that the

975
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,960
european food and safety authority

976
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:00,399
earlier this year

977
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,679
decided

978
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,200
that

979
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:08,000
they will not proceed with any of those

980
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:10,480
applications for food supplements for

981
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,800
the registration

982
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,240
due to the fact that they do not have

983
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,240
enough safety data

984
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,680
that is

985
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,839
a significant setback for the market

986
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:25,039
whether this

987
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,599
is

988
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:29,039
justifiable probably yes

989
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,640
is it correct

990
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:32,800
difficult to say

991
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:35,039
is it helpful for the market deficitly

992
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,039
no

993
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:42,400
and as such

994
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:44,000
the respective applicants are now in a

995
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,800
position

996
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,800
that they have to

997
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,800
provide more than safety

998
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:56,400
data and they may not get an approval in

999
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,639
the near future

1000
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:03,119
because the collecting production of

1001
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:03,118
safety data is an enormous effort

1002
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:09,358
just recently on 28th of june 2022 had

1003
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:10,880
an official hearing which in which we

1004
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:14,000
participated

1005
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,440
and they actually pointed again out that

1006
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,280
we

1007
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,519
basically we are not in a position to

1008
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,519
write any of this requisition without

1009
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,160
again that is a setback for that market

1010
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,720
it doesn't have to do anything with

1011
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:30,480
medical implications

1012
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:33,039
but i wanted to

1013
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,559
provide you with that latest information

1014
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:37,199
it is

1015
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:40,159
up and down with respect to the

1016
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:43,838
liberalization also in the cte market

1017
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:43,838
and we see that as well as

1018
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,960
having said that i really hope

1019
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,880
that the german government is putting

1020
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,240
significant efforts

1021
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,000
into the

1022
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:56,479
next steps

1023
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,400
in order to find a way to open the

1024
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,159
recreation market

1025
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,680
i have to say that we

1026
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:03,598
are to certainly

1027
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:05,679
should not be too optimistic at least

1028
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,720
not even too enthusiastic about the

1029
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:08,239
timeline

1030
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,799
it will come

1031
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:11,838
definitely but when is the question

1032
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,800
probably

1033
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:19,199
sometime in 2024 we may have the first

1034
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:21,839
product on the market if we are lucky

1035
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:22,719
