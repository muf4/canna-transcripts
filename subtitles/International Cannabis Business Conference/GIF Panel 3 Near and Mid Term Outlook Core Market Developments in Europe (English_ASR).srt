that are producing medical cannabis in

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,280
Germany and handed over to Benedict's

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,259
team to have it then distributed to

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,540
pharmacies you just served my co-founder

36
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,780
speak Cornelius Maura who's now on our

00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,978
mostly focusing on the public affairs

39
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,859
division right now and have a close look

40
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,658
at what the regulation will do about

41
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:53,459
medical cannabis and about Recreation

42
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,618
campus in Germany I'm glad to be here

43
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:57,719
with all of you

44
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:00,540
thank you guys

45
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,158
um I guess we'll just Dive Right In um

46
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,140
so

47
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,899
what do you guys think is going to be

48
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,699
the driving force for the European

49
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,699
markets in one to three years and I know

50
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,738
that's not necessarily uh I mean we

51
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:15,299
could look out six months and have a

52
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,780
very different conversation right so

53
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,780
well

54
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,560
um

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,659
you want to go ahead and yeah sure one

56
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,459
one to three years is a long time right

57
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:28,500
now the next three months will I think

58
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,300
be very crucial for Germany because

59
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,120
that's when we'll actually see the draft

60
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,439
law on the new cannabis regulation and

61
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,539
that will

62
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,579
um apply both to medical cannabis and

63
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,979
recreational Cannabis there will be a

64
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,200
recur recreational Cannabis scheme we

65
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:45,299
heard Peter from Denton's talk about the

66
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,759
two pillars of all of that but we'll

67
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,400
also see an amendment of the medical

68
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,679
cannabis world and that will have will

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,420
have a tremendous effect on how the

70
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,060
market will look like in the next one to

71
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:59,219
three years and I have a very positive

72
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,319
attitude towards what is coming because

73
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:03,780
we'll see two things I think in the

74
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:05,699
German Medical Market one is a

75
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,939
reclassification of medical cannabis

76
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:11,459
from a narcotic down to a regular RX

77
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:13,019
medicine that will make access much

78
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,598
easier for patients and prescription

79
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:18,000
much easier for doctors and we'll see a

80
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,139
market increase of the medical cannabis

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,780
Market

82
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:23,699
and the second element is I believe that

83
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,280
we'll see more domestic production of

84
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:28,259
medicinal cannabis in Germany and that's

85
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,818
good obviously for demican but also for

86
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:31,799
other players who want to enter the

87
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:32,639
market of cultivating cannabis in

88
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Germany

89
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,539
so with this positive attitudes I think

90
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,939
we'll see a positive development also

91
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:40,679
for the next one to three years

92
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:43,139
I actually couldn't agree more

93
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,599
especially the reclassification or

94
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,539
rescheduling of cannabis as a

95
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:51,000
non-narcotic would be a real game

96
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:54,000
changer that would be also accelerator

97
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,158
for the whole commercial Market of

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,580
cannabis and in particular for medical

99
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:02,878
cannabis if you ask me I could imagine

100
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,739
there could be a 5x on a addressable

101
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,598
Market

102
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:09,299
maybe not in three months but rather in

103
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:11,759
like two or three years I think this can

104
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:14,580
be very likely and shifts also the whole

105
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:18,120
discussion and the focus on the medical

106
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:22,019
Market because of course adult use

107
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,819
legalization it's all that we want but

108
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,720
at the moment let's face this we're

109
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:29,579
talking in the first pillar about a

110
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,360
non-commercial home grow approach and

111
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:35,279
cannabis Social Clubs approach so the

112
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,680
second part of this first pillar which

113
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,539
is the reclassification is probably the

114
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,418
game changer and can give the whole

115
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,540
industry a lot of momentum so I'm also

116
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:46,918
very positive about that

117
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:49,800
having a look at Europe

118
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:51,599
um we we are also looking at the UK and

119
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,240
Poland

120
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,759
we can see some traction

121
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,639
um gaining in Switzerland

122
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:02,699
and we also have a lot of small

123
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:05,280
countries for example Malta

124
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:08,400
um who are not so interesting in terms

125
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,619
of their population size however they

126
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,060
are also pushing

127
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,540
um

128
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:18,240
the the front line of of legalization

129
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,939
um a little bit more forward so I think

130
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,180
in the next one two three years we will

131
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:25,560
see a lot of markets opening in the

132
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,259
medical field

133
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,978
we will see as my colleagues outlined

134
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:34,439
them a a very easy process of

135
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:37,740
prescribing medical cannabis in Germany

136
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:40,019
thus a strong growth I mean

137
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,439
it is still one of the

138
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:45,538
biggest growth potentials

139
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:48,360
in Europe

140
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:50,819
and so yeah I'm looking very much

141
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,919
forward to the next years because I

142
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:54,659
think there is not that many markets

143
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,620
that actually have the potential of a

144
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,620
two-digit growth rate

145
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,519
I actually fully agree with your last

146
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,979
point this huge growth of potential

147
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,620
people are asking me if I'm a if I'm

148
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:11,459
pessimistic or optimistic a pessimist is

149
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:13,139
an optimist with experience so I'm still

150
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:15,959
an optimist though because I really

151
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:17,939
think in the medical markets and Peter

152
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,159
mentioned it before the bottleneck is

153
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:22,379
really getting doctors to prescribe

154
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,479
medical cannabis and to remove the

155
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:26,939
boundaries which are plentiful we can

156
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,038
speak about this in more detail but the

157
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:31,079
medical Market really is kicking off and

158
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:34,019
in Switzerland where I'm from

159
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:36,120
most barriers regulatory barriers where

160
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,918
you require the special permit to get

161
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,500
cannabis from the federal Office of

162
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,959
Public Health has been removed and every

163
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,139
doctor can prescribe it but most doctors

164
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:48,538
don't know how when why they need

165
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:51,360
education and we need to tackle that

166
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:52,860
problem first and foremost and when it

167
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,479
comes to other markets like the

168
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,020
recreational Market

169
00:06:54,478 --> 00:07:00,000
their true three months is a long time

170
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:02,639
but at the same time it isn't I think

171
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,519
it's going to take much much longer and

172
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,579
when we see the developments here in

173
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:11,279
Germany which unfortunately have taken a

174
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:14,399
very sour turn from my perspective we're

175
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,619
going to see a similar situation in

176
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:20,279
Switzerland unless the government is

177
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:23,538
going to be a very Innovative and very

178
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:27,000
um courageous which I doubt they will be

179
00:07:23,538 --> 00:07:29,219
so I think on wreck side we're going to

180
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,620
have to sit it out for quite a long time

181
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:38,240
to see any reasonable commercialization

182
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,240
possibility that could scale

183
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:43,759
so going back to that

184
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,759
um do you think

185
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:50,758
which European nation is sort of

186
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,439
positioned to sort of have success in

187
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,538
that short period of time like 18 months

188
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:56,579
or so do you think it's going to be the

189
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:58,199
ones that are more open or do you think

190
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:59,159
it's going to be

191
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,960
um

192
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:05,160
the question is how do you define

193
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:07,439
success you know are you targeting

194
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,960
medical cannabis so countries are

195
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:12,360
removing for example cannabis from the

196
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:14,279
narcotics act apparently in Germany is

197
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,860
going that direction that's going to

198
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:19,859
have a direct impact on how cannabis is

199
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,598
prescribed may may be really release or

200
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,720
remove some of the barriers make it more

201
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,219
accessible that's for me a huge and very

202
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,199
important step

203
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:31,800
by the way also it's a blurry line

204
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:34,320
recreational and and medical so there's

205
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,180
a question how far can you stretch the

206
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,740
medical definition

207
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:39,239
and then when you're speaking about

208
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,479
recreational

209
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,940
I think really Switzerland is pretty

210
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,560
good spot at the moment I would say

211
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,500
um I don't think it's the number one

212
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:52,079
mover but we have pilot projects that

213
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:55,139
are going on in Switzerland already for

214
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,778
a while and I think the structure and

215
00:08:55,139 --> 00:09:01,019
the setup of these projects have been

216
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:03,480
very carefully designed and could be a

217
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:05,459
very good base to scale throughout

218
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,220
Germany

219
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:09,958
I think one thing you said is a very

220
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,360
important to notice that's the question

221
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:16,338
how far can you stretch the definition

222
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,659
of medical cannabis and once Germany

223
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:21,000
reclassifies cannabis from a narcotic to

224
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:23,819
an RX I think we can stretch the

225
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,299
definition of medical cannabis very very

226
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,278
very far and then yes we can keep

227
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:31,079
talking about the recreational Market

228
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,480
but that will essentially be just the

229
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,700
home Growers Market maybe cultivation

230
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,980
associations it will be a very small

231
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:41,940
portion of the market I think for the

232
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,920
foreseeable future and expanded and much

233
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,959
broader definition of medical cannabis

234
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:48,240
will be the thing we see in Germany and

235
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:51,359
that's what makes what will make Germany

236
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,500
the go-to place for cannabis I think and

237
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,060
also and that might be interesting for

238
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,220
you also for international companies

239
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:58,379
because as my co-founder canis has

240
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,540
pointed out in a medical Market Imports

241
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:01,740
will probably still be possible so

242
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:04,559
that's good news for the international

243
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:07,680
cannabis industry

244
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,838
and I think uh just adding to that I

245
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,179
think there will always be a certain

246
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,120
amount of cannabis consumers that

247
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:15,838
actually want a medical product in terms

248
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,379
of

249
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:24,019
um Purity in terms of safety and in in

250
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:24,019
terms of cleanness and then quality

251
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,420
oh and I don't know where to jump to

252
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:32,159
next

253
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:35,039
um oh we could talk about quality

254
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:37,079
because I I I heard people from South uh

255
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,759
South Africa in the panel I heard a

256
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,278
couple of guys from Colombia and we

257
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:43,439
discussed Imports and imports are going

258
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,360
to be as I said they will remain a

259
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,339
factor but you guys have to focus on

260
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,079
quality and right now we see a couple of

261
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:51,120
products in the market for some reason

262
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:53,819
they magically got a EU GMP

263
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,419
certification over like kind of tested

264
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:59,640
into EU GMP in Germany but quality is

265
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:00,899
going to matter I think we also see a

266
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,639
price compression right now in the

267
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:04,139
market so now the debate is going to

268
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,539
what's going to happen in the medical

269
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:08,639
cannabis market like what will Define

270
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:10,860
good quality and what will the role be

271
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,299
of price and I'm sure Benedict you have

272
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,480
a very good oversight that being one of

273
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:17,639
the large importers here I I really

274
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,339
agree on that so there are just those

275
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:23,100
two streams that can be successful clear

276
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:24,779
quality differentiation or focus on

277
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,320
price

278
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:27,838
um

279
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,300
quite a few companies right now and this

280
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,820
is also what happens and it's also part

281
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:34,879
of how the industry currently works is

282
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:38,000
that a bunch of

283
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:41,100
companies in the first half of this year

284
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,440
get bankrupt right so they're out of

285
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,259
business they sourced the wrong products

286
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,060
that they can't market so it's also

287
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:49,919
important that you understand what kind

288
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:51,838
of products you're sourcing why you're

289
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,860
sourcing them and to whom you're selling

290
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:58,079
them and I believe

291
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:01,860
using quality product is probably not a

292
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:04,379
bad approach but on the other hand we're

293
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:07,139
struggling a little bit when it comes to

294
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:10,679
the market size at least for the last 12

295
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:13,740
months we are talking rather about 10

296
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:18,778
maybe 20 percent market growth compared

297
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:21,720
to very very high growth in the past so

298
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:23,458
the situation that we might be faced

299
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,980
that we have a reclassification of

300
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:27,899
cannabis will really trigger again a lot

301
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,700
of momentum into the market a lot of new

302
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:32,240
players might try to access the market

303
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,800
we might get a whole new

304
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,419
competition in the market but I also

305
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,278
believe that those that are in the

306
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:40,919
market already that have established

307
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:43,559
Supply chains that have also low-cost

308
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:46,620
sourcing Supply chains in place and

309
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:49,199
quality Supply chains they have a pretty

310
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,000
much Head Start compared to all the

311
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,500
others

312
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,958
and I think if it comes to

313
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,059
differentiation it's not only important

314
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:59,278
to have actually products that can

315
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:02,338
differentiate but also to let the market

316
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:05,338
know it right and in Germany especially

317
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:07,620
in the in the medical market and we

318
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:09,600
figured out that it it's not enough to

319
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,759
tell all the patients you you got to

320
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,899
have the doctors the Pharmacists and the

321
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,319
patients

322
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:18,360
so I think it'll be increment

323
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,240
incremental important for um companies

324
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,919
within the next one to three years to

325
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,259
actually have a proper marketing

326
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:29,240
approach

327
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:32,278
and maybe just one one uh remark to that

328
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:35,639
and there is a lot of potential to

329
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:37,860
actually execute on marketing if we have

330
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,299
a reclassification of cannabis because

331
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,940
that's also important right now it's

332
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:44,120
narcotic so as an industry we're very

333
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:47,519
very limited about

334
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:50,339
addressing any other people than doctors

335
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,440
and Pharmacists and if it's a

336
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:55,440
non-narcotic there are at least

337
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,660
easier ways to talk more open and more

338
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,779
public about those things and I totally

339
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:02,939
agree education information marketing uh

340
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:07,578
will be very important things and also

341
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:11,519
here other countries can hopefully look

342
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:13,799
into the German market and maybe learn

343
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,459
adapt do things smarter better than we

344
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:21,000
do right now as a narcotic we have faced

345
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:23,278
a very limited system when it comes to

346
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,919
marketing

347
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:28,439
just a few thoughts on on price

348
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,899
sensitivity to Quality

349
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,220
I think if if you take a step back and

350
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:34,139
you look at the medical markets the

351
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,820
question is also what kind of delivery

352
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:39,000
forms are we looking at and where is the

353
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:42,180
trend going because this increase this

354
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,399
extreme sensitivity mostly applies I

355
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:46,919
would say to cannabis flower but when

356
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,899
you're looking at cannabis extracts or

357
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,179
even some products that may in the

358
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:54,360
future be synthesized that may also find

359
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:56,099
their way into the medical Market these

360
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,980
small differences whether you produce at

361
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,778
150 or two bucks or three it just

362
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,459
doesn't matter because the price points

363
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:04,980
are completely different

364
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:07,619
uh point so I think it's really

365
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,120
important to also take these Trends into

366
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,399
consideration

367
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,799
and when we're speaking about a certain

368
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:16,259
addressable Market in the in the in the

369
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,479
medical space especially when you say we

370
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:21,419
can stretch at some stage the definition

371
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,959
of what medical cannabis is you also

372
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:27,360
have to uh put this thought into the mix

373
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:30,599
and think about

374
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,820
um maybe for a certain specific product

375
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,139
that just use biomass and that it just

376
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,540
doesn't matter

377
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:38,459
um how much it costs and maybe also

378
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:41,338
there the quality you know that the

379
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:43,679
preservation of the bud and the drying

380
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:46,019
and all of that is just not it's on a

381
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:49,819
different level there's a there's a

382
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:49,820
difference different importance to it

383
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,420
yeah well I would I would say that the

384
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:57,419
U.S saw that I mean price

385
00:15:54,419 --> 00:16:00,899
is compress

386
00:15:57,419 --> 00:16:03,719
um drastically for for certain regions

387
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:05,458
right they just it was

388
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,480
it was three thousand dollars a pound

389
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:11,638
and it went down to below 600 so which

390
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,199
sort of drives to the points of

391
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,879
where is that production going to come

392
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:16,198
from right but that's for a different

393
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,480
topic but

394
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:21,120
so sort of going back do you guys think

395
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,360
that how important is the

396
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,399
U.N single convention going to be to the

397
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,180
cut the countries in Europe that are

398
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,179
looking into this

399
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:35,579
I think that the UN single convention is

400
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,899
um The go-to Authority here uh and that

401
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,758
is not because of it it's a U.N

402
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:42,000
convention but it's been adapted into

403
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:44,459
European legislation so it's EU law and

404
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,278
that's quite binding for

405
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:49,138
um for Germany and that is why if we

406
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:51,299
ever see a recreational Market will not

407
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:53,820
have Imports into the market not because

408
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:55,740
it makes sense economically I totally

409
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,180
agree with this the guy who asked the

410
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,399
question from South Africa saying like

411
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:01,258
doesn't Colombia doesn't it make sense

412
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,759
to produce somewhere somewhere else

413
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:04,318
where it's much more affordable of

414
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:05,939
course it would make sense but the

415
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,338
regulation just doesn't allow it so

416
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:10,500
always be mindful of where the

417
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:12,899
regulation goes because this Market is

418
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,720
not driven only by economics I would say

419
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,880
it's mostly driven by the regulation and

420
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,039
the UN convention is something that even

421
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,520
the the German legislator is bound to so

422
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:26,279
we have to like abide by it

423
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:31,319
um maybe in addition to that at the same

424
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:34,200
time the draft bill or the pillars that

425
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:36,359
are now discussed totally reflect that

426
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,340
right so we are already in a position

427
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:43,500
where the legislator and the regulator

428
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:45,599
understands not only the U.N single

429
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,000
convention but includes them into all

430
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:51,418
the discussions so for me it's more like

431
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,880
do we like it or don't we like it it

432
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:57,620
doesn't really matter because it is

433
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:01,140
already integrated in the the political

434
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:04,798
discussion over already like two cycles

435
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:07,559
of those kind of uh papers that were

436
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:10,558
published in October and March so and

437
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:14,700
and uh April I think so we have to

438
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:17,460
accept that maybe in the long run if we

439
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:20,779
think about global economy about Global

440
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:25,259
Supply chains there might be

441
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:28,319
the possibility four example Imports

442
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:30,660
however we're talking rather about a

443
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:32,819
decade or two decades but not about the

444
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,798
near to midterm right I think we'll see

445
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:36,599
that faster Germany is trying and they

446
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,038
have now figured out a way to like abide

447
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:40,259
by the convention and still go forward

448
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:43,079
with cannabis regulation the Netherlands

449
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:45,720
has started a model project uh Czech

450
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:47,519
Republic is eager I only kind of see

451
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,100
maybe a couple of Eastern European

452
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,900
States and France kind of opposed once

453
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:54,659
they see the economic benefit for

454
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,400
Germany from the Cannabis new cannabis

455
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,500
regulation I think they'll all join

456
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,900
together and we'll see EU regulation for

457
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,298
for cannabis medical and recreational

458
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,519
and that's more like a five year maybe

459
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:08,160
five years away from now

460
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,839
yeah I think it'll take at least five

461
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,380
years because currently there is no

462
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:15,240
majority for for European League

463
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:18,360
legislation on cannabis

464
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,700
um in terms of legalization so

465
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:22,979
um yeah I I think we are we are stuck

466
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,380
with the current situation

467
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,038
and we'll have to make the best out of

468
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,980
it

469
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:32,160
maybe just to to clarify I was very much

470
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:35,419
referring to a global supply chain

471
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:38,759
um in general I I would definitely agree

472
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:40,820
it can be a harmonized system how

473
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:43,500
whatever it looks like

474
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:46,500
rather than like five years then in 20

475
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,419
years so just to clarify

476
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,740
and we have to keep telling the

477
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:51,299
regulator because it's kind of

478
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,099
ridiculous that it's still the

479
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:55,440
prohibition going on especially for

480
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:57,599
medical cannabis it's so ridiculous

481
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,820
we're losing so much money people are

482
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,558
consuming cannabis anyways I don't know

483
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:03,298
who of you has been to Berlin last

484
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:05,279
weekend at the Mary Jane conference

485
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:06,960
right you have an impression that there

486
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,178
is already a full-scale recreational

487
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,980
Cannabis Mark going on right it's

488
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:13,860
happening it's there in the draft

489
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:17,339
legislation the person who drafted this

490
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:20,279
this first draft law she writes that uh

491
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:22,379
one or two out of four Germans have

492
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:24,839
consumed cannabis in the last 30 days

493
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,520
right they are aware we're all smoking

494
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:27,779
they're all smoking right it's

495
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:30,000
ridiculous that we still have this

496
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:31,500
prohibition so we all need to have a

497
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,200
concerted approach let's push the

498
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,119
regulator to accept realities and come

499
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,279
up with a smart regulation to make the

500
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:40,619
situation better by controlling the

501
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,359
quality and by you know by by

502
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:43,889
controlling the access not by

503
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:48,779
prohibition right

504
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:51,240
[Applause]

505
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:53,129
Daniel you

506
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:57,059
I fully agree

507
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:57,060
[Laughter]

508
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:08,220
start here we'll go there we'll go there

509
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:12,059
oh hey guys well it's me again

510
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:14,160
well um I'm an agronomist uh I did my my

511
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:16,079
PhD in physiology and I've been working

512
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,480
in the Cannabis space for the past six

513
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:22,619
years you know knowing the plant and see

514
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:25,259
how we can grow it better and cheaper

515
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:28,259
I've faced two

516
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:32,460
problems during my time in cannabis

517
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:34,140
um one a lot of prejudices from Cannabis

518
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,319
coming from South America and Colombia

519
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:39,600
and to lack of knowledge

520
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:42,658
the first one is the biggest one

521
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:45,298
and is what you mention uh Constantine

522
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:47,400
and it's like people believe that

523
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:51,960
because we grow cannabis at a lower

524
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:54,179
price it has no good quality

525
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,860
that is a huge mistake

526
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,960
you know there are several reasons why

527
00:21:55,859 --> 00:22:00,479
we grow cannabis chipper and it's

528
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:03,659
because hand labor in our countries is

529
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:07,380
cheaper unfortunately second our land is

530
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:10,080
cheaper right and our wages for good

531
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,880
professionals like myself are not as

532
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,839
high as in Europe and other parts of the

533
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,440
world

534
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:19,558
so please take away that prejudice and

535
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,679
that cannabis that is cheaper is poor

536
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:24,899
quality that is completely mistaken I

537
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:27,000
can invite you to my growing facilities

538
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:30,600
in Colombia you can see my facilities

539
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:36,000
they are completely IMC gacp certified

540
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:38,819
BNC right Israel Market you know and

541
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,480
we need to do a better close-up so now

542
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:43,879
my question is why don't we take such

543
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,220
opportunities

544
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:50,159
to put this into a legislation you know

545
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:52,860
from you again as I said before you guys

546
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,600
are here in the legislation making why

547
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:56,879
don't you put this up and try to bring

548
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:59,879
it into consideration and just try to

549
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:03,059
accommodate and foreign you know company

550
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,220
that is doing a good job into your needs

551
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:07,678
thank you

552
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,779
maybe I I take that so first of all

553
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,419
things for the for the

554
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:14,038
um yeah your view on quality and price I

555
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:16,020
would also like to comment on that but

556
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:18,419
regarding your question

557
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:21,658
not only us but many others in the

558
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:25,259
industry lobbied probably the last 24

559
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:29,159
months or 18 months for Global Supply

560
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:32,759
chains on adult use cannabis

561
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:35,460
a lot of us did so but we need to accept

562
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:38,400
right now that the regulator and the

563
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:41,340
legislator is not in favor of that at

564
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,080
the moment and it's not that uh I don't

565
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:45,720
want to fight I don't want to continue

566
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:48,178
the fight but I also have to choose the

567
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:51,419
right fights that I I want to have right

568
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:54,120
and right now we're very close to have a

569
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:57,538
draft bill that might be presented to

570
00:23:54,119 --> 00:24:00,058
the Parliament and this is huge this is

571
00:23:57,538 --> 00:24:03,298
huge for us as industry this is huge for

572
00:24:00,058 --> 00:24:06,178
Germany is huge for Europe and I believe

573
00:24:03,298 --> 00:24:08,400
going down this route even if it means

574
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:12,000
we need to start with a non-commercial

575
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:16,200
home grow and cannabis club set up

576
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,440
uh with only locally produced homegrown

577
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:22,500
cannabis well I take that if it helps us

578
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,140
to come to the next step where we have a

579
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,279
huge medical commercially addressable

580
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,240
Market

581
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:32,279
uh which you could serve with your

582
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:36,058
facilities so I believe it's very

583
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:38,940
important that you need to understand we

584
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:41,099
tried to Lobby into this direction but

585
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:43,798
we also need to accept that doing the

586
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:46,019
right thing now is more important for

587
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:48,900
all of us for the industry than like

588
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:52,619
optimizing in the very very short term

589
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:56,038
on a specific singular question so

590
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:58,439
that's that's my my view here and with

591
00:24:56,038 --> 00:25:01,079
regards to Quality and price I agree

592
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,419
yeah that can be cheap product at great

593
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:06,119
quality we definitely need to

594
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:08,940
differentiate is it indoor grown what is

595
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:11,639
the microbio what is the butt size like

596
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,500
all those things that we consider as a

597
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,980
high quality product and if there is a

598
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,480
cultivator in a low-cost country that

599
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:21,058
can produce those products in high

600
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,759
quality yeah they have probably the

601
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:25,940
great things that that should come to

602
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:29,220
the German Market

603
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:32,460
I would like to uh make one more comment

604
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:35,038
I really think the potential size of the

605
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:37,019
medical Market cannot be underestimated

606
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:38,700
and the reality is that in Switzerland

607
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:40,798
for example today when we're speaking

608
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,740
about the medical Market there's been

609
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:46,259
some estimates where the federal Office

610
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,599
of Public Health says that maybe there's

611
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:50,579
500 000 people consuming cannabis or

612
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:52,500
three to four hundred thousand people

613
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:55,740
consuming cannabis on a regular basis

614
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:58,798
out of eight nine million population and

615
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:01,679
a hundred thousand of these patients are

616
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,480
self-medicating patients but it doesn't

617
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,940
take into account for example five

618
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,940
percent of the Swiss population

619
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:12,500
that's not an official s that's just

620
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:15,360
inofficial estimates that are consuming

621
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,778
opioids on a regular basis

622
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:20,639
most of these patients could for example

623
00:26:17,778 --> 00:26:22,859
they they could hugely benefit from

624
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,600
substituting opioids with uh with

625
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:25,199
medical cannabis

626
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:27,839
um

627
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,058
and that's just the in absolute terms

628
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,399
that's not in relative term so whole

629
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:34,500
Swiss population five percent so the

630
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,320
adult population probably even higher

631
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,900
there is so much potential there still

632
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:42,418
that we haven't been able to explore and

633
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,980
in that market cross-border trade is

634
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:45,900
absolutely open

635
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,099
and it's not something we really have to

636
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,679
keep in mind

637
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:51,959
thank you uh yeah uh we're gonna keep

638
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,220
going I just want to remind people in

639
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,960
the interest of time because a lot of

640
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,839
people have questions let's try to get

641
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,419
to the question quickly uh and we don't

642
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:02,220
always need the whole history uh behind

643
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:04,320
it okay thank you

644
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,940
all right so quick summary we are a GMP

645
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,918
producer in Spain we pay very close

646
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:10,980
attention to what's going on in the

647
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,559
Spanish Market where they have in the

648
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:16,259
government has a subcommittee they've

649
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:18,720
asked the regulatory body to produce

650
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:21,240
um guidance but it's been slow moving my

651
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,038
question is uh are you aware we've

652
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,179
talked a lot about Germany uh are you

653
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:27,240
aware of

654
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:29,038
um or can you highlight other countries

655
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,460
where maybe it's moved Beyond public

656
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:36,240
advocacy to actual deliberation

657
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:38,519
um in governments that could be some of

658
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,419
the next markets in Europe

659
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:43,379
um

660
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:45,900
I think a special interest should have

661
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:49,679
France I mean they're they're finishing

662
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:52,440
their budget in 2024 and and you due to

663
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:55,259
the sheer size of their population they

664
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,659
actually have the potential of

665
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:59,579
um being at least the second biggest

666
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:02,220
Market in Europe

667
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:06,058
um furthermore we as a company are

668
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:08,220
looking at UK Switzerland and Poland

669
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:10,200
however Poland is a little bit more

670
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,259
tricky in terms of Regulation

671
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:17,038
and um yeah so there is there's multiple

672
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:21,079
uh countries that actually

673
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:21,079
um are gaining traction

674
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:31,139
I thank you so yeah

675
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:33,019
um I was hearing Daniel saying that

676
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:36,179
um the definition of

677
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:38,700
uh of other products like extract could

678
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:41,538
be something that could have a big

679
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:44,880
importance also in the recreational

680
00:28:41,538 --> 00:28:48,119
market so can you please elaborate also

681
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:51,840
maybe also uh Constantine what's your

682
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:56,819
view on the idea that there is at the

683
00:28:51,839 --> 00:29:00,240
moment a threshold for THC potency while

684
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:03,000
eventually the best approach would be to

685
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,819
regulate more on the quantity and

686
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,419
therefore extract that could be

687
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:10,859
concentrated form could eventually be

688
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:13,980
favorite

689
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:15,778
on that regard thank you so I think in

690
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,000
the medical Market extracts will be a

691
00:29:15,778 --> 00:29:20,640
winner midterm for sure all the doctors

692
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,259
we talked to I'd say 80 prefer extract

693
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,820
over flour

694
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:26,339
um so that's a no-brainer you just have

695
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:29,038
to come up with a stable formulation a

696
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:31,798
good product that can be uh delivered

697
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:33,720
sustainably so that's that's no-brainer

698
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:35,339
on the recreational Cannabis Market I'm

699
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,899
a little more skeptical

700
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:40,199
um because if you look at the consumers

701
00:29:36,898 --> 00:29:42,778
uh reaction I think um in Behavior they

702
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,120
prefer the flour they like Edibles and

703
00:29:42,778 --> 00:29:47,700
other other form factors but not so much

704
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:49,259
accurate extracts like as they are

705
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,778
applied in the medic medicinal market

706
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:53,398
and Edibles and so on that won't be

707
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:55,919
allowed in the near future and even with

708
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:57,959
extracts I'm kind of skeptical that this

709
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,000
will be allowed it would require another

710
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,100
level of Education towards the regulator

711
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,919
and we'll be happy if we have like

712
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:07,199
educated them enough on flowers so that

713
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:09,299
they will allow that so more skeptical

714
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,120
about the recreational Market definitely

715
00:30:09,298 --> 00:30:15,000
a winner midterm in the medical Market

716
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:17,158
maybe let me add some some further uh

717
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,220
figures on the the extracts market right

718
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:24,240
now the total medical cannabis Market is

719
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:26,339
like 60 flowers around about 20 extracts

720
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,159
another 20

721
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:31,439
um isolates which is dronabinal mainly

722
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:35,399
um we see that the flowers market is

723
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,500
super patient driven we have again a lot

724
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:40,619
of self-players in that market some say

725
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,778
30 other say 80 it might be somewhere in

726
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:45,538
between and the extracts is pretty much

727
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:47,240
doctors driven and at the same time once

728
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:50,879
you have a

729
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:54,980
patient that uses a certain extract you

730
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:58,080
see that the quote or that it is

731
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:59,700
re-prescribed is very high compared to

732
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:02,460
the flowers market where we have a lot

733
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:06,899
of switching patients and from like a

734
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:10,019
pure Revenue perspective as a company

735
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:11,819
that offers those products yes I totally

736
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:13,139
agree extracts it's pretty interesting

737
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:16,678
especially especially when a lot of

738
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:19,380
maybe patient-driven people in like

739
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:22,919
really the future might go out of the

740
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:26,700
medical Market because they go for home

741
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:29,460
growing or get another product adult use

742
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,259
product to substitute that so it's a

743
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,600
very relevant category which is at the

744
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:34,980
moment pretty underestimated and also

745
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:37,379
you shouldn't underestimate the fact

746
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,480
that there's a most for example

747
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,940
neuropathic pain patients are in a

748
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,099
multi-medication setup it's not just a

749
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,659
single

750
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:47,519
you don't substitute five medications

751
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:50,580
with medical cannabis you continue to

752
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,139
take various various medication plus

753
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:53,778
cannabis and it's so much easier to

754
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:57,720
titrate

755
00:31:53,778 --> 00:32:02,179
extracts than than having someone inhale

756
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,179
or even smoke a bud

757
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,000
okay

758
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:13,678
all right good morning

759
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:17,220
um I'm a producer in Argentina and also

760
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:21,240
in Colombia so and and this last point

761
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:23,720
is really what my my main interest is I

762
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:27,240
don't know if you guys are aware but uh

763
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:29,579
Argentina has a brand new cannabis law

764
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,759
industrial cannabis law on the table for

765
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:35,339
the president to sign

766
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:37,440
and we did my company did a lot of Lobby

767
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:39,720
into that new law

768
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,399
and

769
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:45,778
one of the things that we're going to

770
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:47,879
see very soon is a new threshold of THC

771
00:32:45,778 --> 00:32:50,038
on Industrial Hemp

772
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,720
all of a lot of the countries in South

773
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:54,119
America are going to allow one percent

774
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:58,079
THC as a threshold

775
00:32:54,119 --> 00:33:01,319
and also Argentina in particular which

776
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:03,898
is a very large agriculture country with

777
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:05,939
a lot of experience in large Agro

778
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:09,500
operations

779
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:12,899
we are going to allow up to 2.5 percent

780
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:15,298
with uh lab remediation

781
00:33:12,898 --> 00:33:17,879
right so if you go over the threshold

782
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:21,839
you can go to the an extraction lab and

783
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:24,480
just produce an extract from biomass

784
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:27,298
and my question because I'm

785
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,460
I'm an investor also and I wanna we're

786
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:33,599
trying to figure out whether we should

787
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:37,620
be setting up a GMP uh flower drawing

788
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:39,599
facility or just a lab for extraction my

789
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:42,658
question is what do you think is going

790
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:46,199
to happen to this Market when good

791
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:48,059
quality extracts will come from you know

792
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,700
at a price of what happened in the US

793
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:53,099
with the CBD that was used to be a

794
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:56,640
couple thousand dollars uh a kilogram

795
00:33:53,099 --> 00:34:00,178
and today it's only 300 is there is

796
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:02,820
there a place for in this market for

797
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:05,278
extracts that are cheap and what's going

798
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:10,559
to happen to the flower market if you

799
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:13,739
can buy a gram of extract 98 THC for the

800
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:15,838
same price as a gram of flour

801
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:18,479
I think it highly depends on the market

802
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:22,440
segment so um if you talk about medical

803
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:26,159
extracts you always need a doctor to

804
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:28,619
prescribe it right so as a as a foreign

805
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:32,099
company you should probably have some

806
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:33,119
some local partner that actually has a

807
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:36,359
network

808
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,220
that is able to educate and and and talk

809
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:40,799
to doctors right

810
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:43,439
um if you import flour

811
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,839
um I I don't think that it works just

812
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,059
just to put a flower damn cheap on the

813
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:51,838
German market and and and it will will

814
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:52,980
be sold uh initial yeah instantly I

815
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:55,259
think

816
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:57,780
um it is not that easy anymore in the

817
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:01,500
German Market but Benedict how do you

818
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:05,460
see this yeah maybe just one uh remark

819
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:08,219
here what you've mentioned is already

820
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:10,920
in a smaller scale reality in the market

821
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:14,459
to it to be honest we have flowers I

822
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,500
know five 400 different products in the

823
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:19,500
market or 200 I really don't know

824
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:22,440
already although we have all of them uh

825
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:26,099
the extracts we have a lot of different

826
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:28,440
suppliers we have one that is very much

827
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:31,619
leading the whole segment with over 50

828
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,780
market share and we have already pretty

829
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:36,119
low cost full spectrum extracts

830
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,920
available and at the same time we also

831
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:40,320
have

832
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,820
dronabinol isolates uh so to say also

833
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,359
available in the market so we already

834
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:48,119
see that a patient and a doctor would

835

flour or a equivalent of extract

837
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:56,059
