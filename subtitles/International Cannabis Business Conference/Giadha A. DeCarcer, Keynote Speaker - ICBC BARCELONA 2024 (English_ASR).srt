DJ mugs tonight at

19
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:55,600
9:00 and uh I just want to say that um

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,960
you know I heard some coffee shops got

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,920
raided last night did anyone hear that

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,878
that some coffee shops got raided yeah

23
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,079
you know it's so ironic here we are it

24
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,879
feels like weed is legal but I always

25
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:11,959
say that the battle's Just Begun so even

26
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:14,280
when uh uh uh we make uh progress with

27
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:16,759
policy that's really when the work just

28
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,320
beg is begun begins because the devil's

29
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:23,680
in the details right and so they say 90

30
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:27,078
uh implementation is 90% of the law and

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,240
so it's incumbent upon us to educate and

32
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:31,798
push it out there in a diser Babylon you

33
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,319
know what I'm saying cuz we all live in

34
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,159
the institution right and we all have to

35
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,839
St strong and stand up now in some ways

36
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:40,880
I think I'm preaching to the choir

37
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,640
because I think that's most of all of

38
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,478
you right now right here we're not

39
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,759
complacent we stand up for what we

40
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:49,239
believe in and that's not just cannabis

41
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,040
that's human rights and treating each

42
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:55,000
other with respect and dignity all the

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,000
time right because unless you're a total

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,039
[ __ ] then you can [ __ ] off right but

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,280
we have to have tolerance for uh for for

46
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:03,920
people and things and we have to

47
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,478
understand that it's a magical miracle

48
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,280

49

about wow it's been 10 years and I've

117

had the privilege of of attending uh the

118
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:19,159
ICBC for a decade now and it feels like

119
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,840
a College reunion it really does it

120
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,840
doesn't feel like work it feels like fun

121
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:28,918
so thank you acbc for having me uh very

122
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:30,879
exciting time Germany finally legalized

123
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:34,918
recreational

124
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:39,519
and I am here today um to help draw some

125
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:41,719
parallels from what happened in the US

126
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:45,159
after the first recreational

127
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,960
legalization what can we learn The Good

128
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,199
the Bad and the Ugly the risks and the

129
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:53,198
opportunities from the

130
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,639
experience that um that we can see from

131
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,639
the United States of North America in

132
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,639
general

133
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:06,800
yep it

134
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:10,639
works so fun and games

135
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:14,360
aside we say that you know we're history

136
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,560
repeats itself and um you know we're

137
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,879
doomed if we don't learn from it I

138
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,240
believe that it creates a great

139
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:23,000
opportunity for us here in Europe given

140
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,240
that we have our peers in North America

141
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,959
that have truly had their first chance

142
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,879
of making the mistakes learned the

143
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:32,758
lessons and that if we look back we may

144
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:35,360
be able to expedite uh and

145
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:40,160
maximize uh what we can truly we can

146
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,160
truly do for the industry here uh in

147
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:46,959
Europe so who am I a little bit of

148
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,399
background uh well I've had the pleasure

149
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:52,198
to see a lot of friendly faces um there

150
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:55,279
also a lot of new faces so I came into

151
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:57,478
the industry in 2014 in the US I founded

152
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,799
a company called New Frontier data and

153
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:02,478
we were the first to come in uh trying

154
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,960
to really look at Raw data uh draw

155
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:08,318
analytics and be able to predict where

156
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:11,758
the risks and the opportunities would be

157
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,000
uh 2014 was an interesting year in North

158
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:18,720
America because in

159
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,360
2012 uh Oregon uh uh and was uh Colorado

160
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,919
and Washington state were the first

161
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,919
states to legalize recreational Cannabis

162
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:27,639
despite the California was the first

163
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:29,918
legalized in the 1990s we really saw a

164
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:32,598
shift in the marketplace

165
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:35,598
both from an investment and a new

166
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:37,959
business perspective really in 2013 and

167
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,959
2014 so I've had the privilege to sort

168
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:43,638
of had a front row seat at what happened

169
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,638
and what was the

170
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,879
story so what happened since so I want

171
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:52,199
to First Take sort of a look at the

172
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,120
globe and then bring it back to Europe

173
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,800
we have over a 100 Nations around the

174
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,478
world that have either legalized or

175
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,598
decriminalized cannabis today I remember

176
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,439
saying that there were 18 States now

177
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:04,199
it's over a 100 Nations we've gone a

178
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:06,598
long way in just a

179
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,759
decade and what's happened in this last

180
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:12,478
decade if we begin to see some uh

181
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:14,720
Regional Trends with some specific

182
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,519
specialization in each of these regions

183
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,919
when it comes to the Cannabis industry

184
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:20,399
which is really unique uh because the

185
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:23,198
Cannabis industry went from being an

186
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,158
Emerging Market to a global phenomenon

187
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,520
so North America really sort of the

188
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:32,278
epicenter of consumption um a lot of

189
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:35,718
sort of uh plant touching uh Innovation

190
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:37,719
uh and b2c sort of types of businesses

191
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,080
uh also North America continues to be

192
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:43,000
the largest consumer Market in the world

193
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,720
mind you Europe is expected to sec to be

194
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,600
the second largest then we have Latin

195
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,240
America where we have seen some serious

196
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,159
deregulation and they seem to be

197
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,320
positioning themselves as more of a

198
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:56,559
lower cost cultivation Hub uh with an

199
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,278
intent of really exporting to those

200
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:03,639
consumer markets so Europe and nor North

201
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:06,200
America Asia Pacific very interesting

202
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:09,159
region as far as the Cannabis industry

203
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,879
really looking to focus in R&amp;D whether

204
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:14,078
it is from medical use or Industrial

205
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:18,039
Hemp applications so we're seeing a lot

206
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:19,759
of uh new uh IP uh in terms of the

207
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:22,639
graphin of hemp and we're also seeing

208
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:24,559
some very Advanced um research in terms

209
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:27,559
of the medicinal applications of

210
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:31,000
cannabis for things such as

211
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:32,319
cancer Africa Africa is very interesting

212
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,039
as well while there aren't as many

213
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,120
nations that have legalized uh or

214
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,559
decriminalized Africa has been an

215
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,480
agro-based economy as a whole mostly

216
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:44,239
dominated by tobacco cultivation given

217
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,639
the decrease in tobacco consumption

218
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,240
around the world they have been looking

219
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:53,039
for an opportunity to both diversify out

220
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:56,360
of tobacco but also I must admit um cut

221
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,599
the bonds from Chinese sort of financial

222
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,200
dominance I'm sorry I'm going to say it

223
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,200
and so they're looking at hemp as an

224
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:07,079
opportunity to get out of that situation

225
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:10,040
with a hope to also export lowcost uh

226
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:11,838
hemp and cannabis to Europe with of

227
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:14,879
course some regulatory challenges

228
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:18,120
they're still trying to work through and

229
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:20,120
last but not least Europe Europe is the

230
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,679
big question mark we all want to figure

231
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,879
out what's going to happen in Europe

232
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,958
Europe is really specially

233
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:27,879
positioned Europe has had the

234
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,479
opportunity to look and learn from

235
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:31,838
what's happened around the world they've

236
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,759
taken their time they've been very wise

237
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,800
as the old Nation uh to wait for the

238
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:40,799
right time Europe also has the benefit

239
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:44,278
of a very mature uh food and beverage uh

240
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:46,559
and health and beauty um industrial

241
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:48,200
infrastructure whereby those Advanced

242
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:50,799
application of cannabis for those

243
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,480
sectors may be the true opportunity so

244
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:56,519
maybe it is a processing Hub maybe it's

245
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,240
a consumer goods export Hub uh the

246
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:01,240
question mark remains but the

247
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
opportunities are certainly

248
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,120
material how material are they the

249
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,240
global cannabis industry today is that

250
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,159
of over 300 billion it is massive and

251
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,320
that's a conservative number mind you

252
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:17,519
you're going to see a lot of numbers uh

253
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,760
from a variety of data and analytics

254
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,120
experts which I'm very happy to see that

255
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,639
since new data was born now there are

256
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,799
many looking but what we all agree on is

257
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:30,200
that it's huge and that it's growing

258
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:32,599
interestingly look at Europe Europe it's

259
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,480
almost a $70 billion opportunity Manu

260
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,519
that does include illegal use and what

261
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,120
we have seen in North America is as

262
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,320
states were legalizing there was about a

263
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,560
30% shift from illegal use to Legal use

264
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:50,160
so there is a material opportunity an

265
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:50,159
early stage opportunity here in

266
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:58,079
Europe what else can we see from a trend

267
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,399
perspective when we look at the US well

268
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,599
we talk about the 8year economic cycle

269
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,200
guess what that really does work it's

270
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:10,360
real because that's what we saw in the

271
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:14,720
US from 2012 to 2020 we sort of saw a

272
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:17,199
bell curve type of shift in terms of the

273
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,160
volume of investment that went into the

274
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:21,639
industry the number of companies that

275
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:24,799
started and went to

276
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:26,879
Market as well as a quite diverse

277
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,879
sequencing of shift of the types of

278
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:32,000
businesses that were ripe to Pro Prof

279
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:34,519
and succeed and I'll talk a little bit

280
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,519
more about

281
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,440
that so let's first talk about money how

282
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,000
did the investment how did the capital

283
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,800
markets in North America and the

284
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,159
Cannabis industry sort of advanced

285
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:50,399
you'll notice that I the numbers do not

286
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:51,879
start in 2012 or in 2014 and that's

287
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,360
because the type of Investments that

288
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:55,000
went in early on in the Cannabis

289
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,399
industry were primarily from Angel

290
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,440
Investors some of them not even

291
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,879
accredited uh and they were really Small

292
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:06,199
Checks when I came in I raised my first

293
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:08,000
million about 25 to $50,000 at a time it

294
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:10,399
was gruesome but that's what happened

295
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,720
there it was the green Rush there was

296
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,600
there was money floating around there

297
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,879
were a lot of investors sort of writing

298
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,199
checks but there were small checks so

299
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:20,360
the overall amounts were un llarge we

300
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:23,439
did begin to see a shift in 2015 and

301
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,440
2016 and what happened is the industry

302
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,279
was getting smarter and folks from

303
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,040
outside of the Cannabis industry venture

304
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:33,519
capitalist created canab abis specific

305
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:35,240
funds so this is still not non-cannabis

306
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,919
it's still not institutional investment

307
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,120
per se but it was beginning to sort of

308
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,559
operate These funds were beginning to

309
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,399
operate like more mature uh venture

310
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,759
capitalist so they were starting to look

311
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,440
at financials it wasn't just about ooh

312
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:50,919
you have cultivation and weed let's

313
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,480
invest we started to begin to see sort

314
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:57,039
of a shift and

315
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,560
maturation in 2017 to 2021 is where we

316
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,399
really saw the boom and if you look at

317
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,599
the graph you can sort of see that

318
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,519
increase so what happened well first and

319
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,639
foremost institutional investors finally

320
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:09,039
paid attention they began to see

321
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,600
consumption in the Cannabis industry go

322
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,278
up they began to see States legalizing

323
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,079
being able to have extra Revenue to

324
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,240
spend in things like education and

325
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:19,439
decrease in crime and so the interest

326
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,560
was there so number one institutional

327
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,920
investment came in number two there was

328
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:25,518
a begin beginning of sort of this idea

329
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,360
of going public I mean it wasn't

330
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,720
necessarily sort of the boom that we saw

331
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,759
all the way in 2019 and 2020 but there

332
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,759
was a

333
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:36,480
shift 20 2019 is where we really had an

334
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:38,278
explosion and that was absolutely driven

335
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,440
by the public market both in Canada and

336
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:43,720
the United States but mostly Canada and

337
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,040
then you see this drop in 2020 yes Co

338
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,920
happened that's what happened really but

339
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:50,639
what's interesting to note in 2020 is

340
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:52,799
that the size of the checks of the deals

341
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,240
were the largest ever in history we're

342
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:58,078
talking about half a billion

343
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,600
plus then 2021 we saw sort of a

344
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:04,198
continuations of do that public market

345
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:07,320
activity with a drop in

346
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:09,278
2022 now why the drop well variety of

347
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,600
reasons the biggest one is poor

348
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:12,600
performance of

349
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,399
companies companies were just not

350
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,000
performing as well as the investors were

351
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,519
expected and those institutional

352
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,879
investors that mature Capital Market

353
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:22,360
that came in were not okay with the

354
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,198
financial performance and the

355
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,440
ineffective operation of some of these

356
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:28,039
businesses remember that the the the

357
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,000
birth of the Cannabis industry in the

358
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:32,838
United States was really stemming from a

359
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,240
movement so the folks that came in were

360
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:37,880
folks that mind mind you might have been

361
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,360
in the illegal Market coming in so they

362
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:42,360
weren't necessarily you know work and

363
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,079
graduates not that it matters a lot of

364
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,680
them succeeded but overall they didn't

365
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:49,198
have the level of sophistication in

366
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,399
business to grow and scale a business

367
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,599
something that is probably going to be

368
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,839
very different here in Europe another

369
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,319
interesting thing to note about 2022 is

370
00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:01,160
that we begin to see a shift from Equity

371
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:05,278
to debt why why well again Equity was

372
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:07,120
too risky so um operators that now

373
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:08,519
really needed to scale and grow

374
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,480
especially with from a surge of

375
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:13,240
consumption during covid needed capital

376
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,800
and they had nowhere to get it and so

377
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,879
they went for debt and that has become

378
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:19,958
very expensive since so in the United

379
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:22,639
States today you have a really really

380
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:24,838
tight Capital Market and many of those

381
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,278
operators are coming into Europe where

382
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,639
they feel there's more opportunity

383
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,639
there's more liquidity

384
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:37,720
so both from an operator perspective and

385
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:39,439
an investor perspective so it doesn't

386
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,079
matter if you're looking to invest or if

387
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,120
you're looking to put in a business what

388
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,919
can we learn from what happened in sort

389
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:50,919
of that 8 to 10 year experience in the

390
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:54,198
US well that 2012 to 2015 as I mentioned

391
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:57,919
really Angel investment Small Checks

392
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:59,559
seed the green RH if it was Cannabis you

393
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:02,439
were in

394
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:04,119
great well here in Europe arguably we've

395
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,880
kind of gone through that honestly we

396
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:07,399
skipped the green rush because of all

397
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,199
the reasons I mentioned before this is

398
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,519
already a market that is starting from a

399
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,038
much more mature position The Operators

400
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:16,119
and the investors that are looking at

401
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:17,599
this space are either coming from the US

402
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,918
where they've or North America where

403
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,958
they've already learned their lessons

404
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:22,919
and earned their stripes or they are

405
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,120
mature investors and operators already

406
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,880
established in Europe that are looking

407
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:28,918
to diversify into the Cannabis space so

408
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,520
let's say that we skipped it now I

409
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,960
putting the European opportuni sort of

410
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:35,679
still a little bit to the left because

411
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,640
there still are some seed and plant

412
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,798
touching uh

413
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,200
opportunities but we I believe that we

414
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:44,679
truly are in sort of that second phase

415
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:48,519
and what we saw in the US between 2016

416
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:51,080
and 2018 where it really is post seed

417
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:54,200
not so much plant touching right

418
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:56,038
especially in Europe um still some plant

419
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,798
touching but really we're looking at

420
00:17:56,038 --> 00:18:00,240
more

421
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:01,960
sophisticated uh um business and value

422
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,480
propositions that truly are looking to

423
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,200
support those plant touching operators

424
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,440
and the plant touching vertical of the

425
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,080
industry other things that are very

426
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,720
unique to to Europe and that we saw in

427
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,678
the second phase in the US is this

428
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,360
introduction of hemp specific not so

429
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:23,120
hemp for CBD of course medicinal use in

430
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:25,558
Europe is extremely important but atast

431
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:27,319
Advanced industrial applications that

432
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:29,519
the European market today has the

433
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:31,519
benefit of really capital relizing on

434
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:35,240
because research and development has had

435
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:37,158
10 years to um evolve around the world

436
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,519
and not necessarily specifically in the

437
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:41,760
United States of North America a lot of

438
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,918
it is happening in Asia

439
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:46,200
Pacific and last but not least real

440
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,720
estate interestingly enough uh real

441
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,400
estate in the United States well it

442
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,960
seems like a no-brainer right if you're

443
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,400
cultivating or you're processing you

444
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,480
obviously need real estate how come

445
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,720
there's not a lot of investment in it

446
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,120
well lessons learns tell us real estate

447
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,720
is going to go up and it's going to be

448
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:03,879
very interesting once we reach that Apex

449
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,519
of consumption in Europe real estate is

450
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,799
definitely something that Europeans have

451
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:11,200
an opportunity to look at right now as

452
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:13,720
it pertains to the Cannabis space and

453
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,480
then in the US between 2019 and 2022

454
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,600
what we saw as I mentioned really the

455
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,319
public market but specifically we we saw

456
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:23,119
the emergence of REITs um we saw the

457
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:26,279
emergence of ETFs specific to cannabis

458
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:28,798
lots of SPS For Better or For Worse uh

459
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:30,798
and I don't have time to to dive deeper

460
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:32,359
into it but the spax phenomenon in the

461
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:35,558
United States when it comes to cannabis

462
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:38,399
was quite tumultous let's just say and a

463
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:41,759
lot of m&amp; and iOS and the m&amp;a was really

464
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,280
sort of a a consolidation phenomena

465
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:44,919
whereby unfortunately the smaller

466
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:48,200
companies or the companies that weren't

467
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:51,400
able to scale and grow or secure Capital

468
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,558
to grow to scale and grow were absorbed

469
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,440
uh by others or when out a business and

470
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:59,359
we are still at that stage I would say

471
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,360
in the United States today

472
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:07,240
some very high level key Lessons Learned

473
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,639
and mind you I expect that the audience

474
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,880
today is sophisticated and some of this

475
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:17,038
is going to feel like a duh we know that

476
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,640
but this is more a way to look at what

477
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:22,279
happened in the US and the mistakes that

478
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,960
we did make there and the the lessons

479
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:26,759
that we learned from those mistakes uh

480
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,079
and also after 10 years at looking at

481
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:32,798
Dex and um For Better or For Worse

482
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:35,319
raising Capital um these are sort of the

483
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:38,038
things that truly Rose to the surface as

484
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:40,519
far as not what to do and not to do at

485
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:44,319
this point in Europe so

486
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:46,240
dudes honest and diverse leadership that

487
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:48,678
may seem sort of like a silly thing to

488
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,720
say or an obvious statement it isn't the

489
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:53,080
Cannabis industry for better for worse

490
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,640
is still a little shady it's still a

491
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:58,199
great area so having an honest and

492
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,919
diverse given that it's a global uh uh

493
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,120
industry and mind you I'm a woman and

494
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:05,480
I'm a you know I'm I'm a half Cuban

495
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:07,158
woman so that's also very dear to me but

496
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,519
diversity and honesty in the industry

497
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:10,640
from a leadership perspective is

498
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:13,119
extremely important in order to have a

499
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,080
successful business if you believe in

500
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:17,119
karma but also have the trust of an

501
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:19,599
investor and the Capital

502
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:22,399
Market knowledgeable and Professional

503
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:24,119
Management may also seem obvious but

504
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,880
guess what in the Cannabis industry you

505
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:27,519
do need those folks that are veterans in

506
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,200
the Cannabis industry that understand

507
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,200
the plant that understand the market

508
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,200
that understand the consumer but you

509
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,720
also need folks that truly understand

510
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,960
business and mature business because the

511
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,278
competitive environment today is much

512
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,159
tougher than it was when I came in in

513
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:44,558
2014 you have pharmaceutical you do have

514
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:47,400
health and beauty you have food and

515
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:49,960
beverage you have some serious money and

516
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,679
knowledge that is interested in this

517
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,200
space so your management needs to be up

518
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:57,519
to the task of navigating it and

519
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,798
Defending Your

520
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:01,558
Position clear and

521
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:03,119
substantiated and this is something

522
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:05,558
that's true in cannabis and it's it's

523
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,678
true anywhere else and before preparing

524
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:09,158
for this chat I did kind of call all my

525
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,640
pals that are still investing in

526
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:14,120
cannabis and not in

527
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,360
cannabis and I kind of you know I asked

528
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:17,239
I asked the question you know what are

529
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,678
the three things that I really sort of

530
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,960
Make It or Break It For You in your

531
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:22,919
thesis of investment regardless to what

532
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,798
you're investing in they said three

533
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:27,159
things number one clear Market

534
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:28,480
understanding what that means is if

535
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:30,278
you're in the Cannabis industry choose

536
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,720
use your vertical don't be like all over

537
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:35,038
the place you want to be vertically

538
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,880
integrated great be very clear and be

539
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:38,759
able to substantiate what your target

540
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,799
addressable Market is because there are

541
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:42,240
a lot of shiny objects in the Cannabis

542
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,519
industry and they'll continue to be and

543
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,679
they're very distracting and investors

544
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:48,759
do not like destruction and destruction

545
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,960
leads to inefficiency for

546
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:55,319
operators two clear and substantiated

547
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,840
product what is it that you do I don't

548
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:58,158
think doing it all is really the way to

549
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:00,959
go that may have worked in the United

550
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,320
States 10 years ago but today I think in

551
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,600
Europe there's really an opportunity to

552
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:06,480
specialize and the deeper and the niche

553
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:07,759
the more Niche you are the more likely

554
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,278
you're going to be able to defend and

555
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:12,798
plant that

556
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:14,679
flag traction and this is something that

557
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:17,798
definitely wasn't on the board 10 years

558
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:21,278
ago because it was new how do you prove

559
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:23,119
traction well now you can and investors

560
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:26,640
are expecting you to prove it and

561
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:28,479
substantiate it have that pilot show

562
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,400
what your consumer wants and that

563
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,480
engagement because it's going to be

564
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,480
expected it isn't the green Rush

565
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,640
anymore the

566
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:42,519
does well alas a good idea is not

567
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,640
necessarily a business a business needs

568
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:48,879
a business plan I mean I remember uh my

569
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,080
first my first pitch was in Austin Texas

570
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,679
in like

571
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:54,439
2014 um I was the only woman on stage

572
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:56,159
and I was the only one talking about

573
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,880
something that didn't involve smoking it

574
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,679
in fact someone on stage and I I tell

575
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,720
this a lot literally booed and said if

576
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:04,840
we can't smoke it we don't care because

577
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,640
I was talking about data but at that

578
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:08,199
point basically if you had a power point

579
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,080
and it said cannabis in it it was a

580
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,000
business plan well that's no longer the

581
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,720
case you need a real business plan maybe

582
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,159
not a 50-page PDF but certainly

583
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,600
something that's well thought out with a

584
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,440
mission a vision um an actual financial

585
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:23,240
plan I mean all of the sort of

586
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,399
infrastructure of a real house when it

587
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:29,720
comes to a business two competition

588
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:31,158
cannot be ignored and anymore it is a

589
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,440
global market where you're getting

590
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:35,080
competitors no no longer just locally or

591
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,038
across the street your competition is

592
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:40,278
regional and Global uh and that makes

593
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:42,200
makes it that you leasts to number three

594
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:44,640
that you need to be extremely thoughtful

595
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,080
about your strategy so businesses that

596
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,520
do not have a very very clear

597
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:51,319
operational financial and strategic plan

598
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:53,639
are not only likely not to be of

599
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:55,839
interest to a sophisticated investor but

600
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,600
also likey not going to be able to truly

601
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:00,319
make it and succeed in the Cannabis

602
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:00,319
industry today

603
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:09,519
so yes history does repeat itself but

604
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:11,038
every time it does the price goes up and

605
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:13,079
I think that for us that means that we

606
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,158
can make more money so I wish for all of

607
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:16,599
you to be very successful and very

608
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:21,080
profitable in the Cannabis industry in

609
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:21,079
Europe and thank you so much
