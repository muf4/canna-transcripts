1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,120
my name is xenia van maalzan i'm a

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,320
pharmacist networker and

3
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:14,959
regulatory expert so

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,879
i've worked in the recent years with

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,039
companies trying to

6
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:20,960
launch the german market and then

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,920
finally did it

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,800
and

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,279
yeah

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,920
i have here with me today

11
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:29,439
for experts who can talk about various

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,280
different

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:36,000
aspects or perspectives of distribution

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,920
and how to get product

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,960
really into the market and i think

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,719
that's

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,640
what we talk about how do we make

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,719
medicinal cannabis

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,200
accessible to the patients here in

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,200
germany

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,719
they have complex backgrounds so i need

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,719
to look at my notes

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,198
yes so let me start here from

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,640
my left side tony schroeder he's

25
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:11,519
board member and head of compliance

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,200
let's say the group compliance at

27
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,719
and he is

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,240
working then extensively in the sites

29
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:22,719
to assure compliance with gmp on on the

30
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:25,118
manufacturing sites at vico

31
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:29,118
such as macedonia

32
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:31,680
and next to him is cornelius maura ceo

33
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:34,239
and co-founder of dimikan and dimikan is

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,479
a company who received as we've heard

35
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,959
today a couple of times

36
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:42,239
the license to produce domestic

37
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:45,519
medicinal cannabis here in germany

38
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:48,078
on his side is alessandro rossoni i hope

39
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,719
that's spelled right

40
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:53,359
he's co-founder and managing director at

41
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:56,399
nimbo cells and nimbus is a wholesaler

42
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:58,159
and gxp platform for cannabinoid

43
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,040
medicinal products

44
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,479
they license as importer wholesaler

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,040
manufacturer

46
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:08,478
and they already launched quite a couple

47
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,640
of products and which he might want to

48
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,680
mention later on

49
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,719
and then at the far end

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,200
i have benedict zones he's co-founder

51
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:22,719
and ceo of cansativa

52
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:25,519
and kansai was granted

53
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:28,400
in august last year with a permission

54
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,800
for exclusive distribution

55
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,840
of domestic cannabis so

56
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,280
cancertifa will act as the sole

57
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,840
distributor for the cannabis agency in

58
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,840
germany

59
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:45,840
yeah so

60
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:48,239
as i said for me as a pharmacist

61
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,959
the story with cannabis started when i

62
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,039
heard the story of a

63
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,039
young

64
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:58,158
boy who

65
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,439
was living with severe epilepsy

66
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,598
who had

67
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,039
major

68
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,518
seizures

69
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:07,679
over the day many seizures and this

70
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,599
could not be treated with

71
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,239
normal school medicine

72
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:14,238
the mother looked out for therapeutic

73
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,560
alternatives and

74
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,800
found medicinal cannabis and could

75
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,280
really tremendously

76
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,800
improve the situation for her son as

77
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,519
such that

78
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,799
nowadays there are no more seizures and

79
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,599
and he can

80
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,840
really live a relaxed

81
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:34,158
normal

82
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,120
or he can develop normally and live a

83
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,959
good life with his family without having

84
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,158
massive

85
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,280
aggressions because of side effects

86
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:48,878
so for me to see how medicinal cannabis

87
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,799
as an innovative drug can solve really

88
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,518
a medical need

89
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,319
is what drives me to support also

90
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,280
companies in reaching the german market

91
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:02,079
in acts yeah providing access to this

92
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,438
medicine so i'm happy to discuss it from

93
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,439
the various areas today

94
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:10,079
so

95
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:12,840
yeah it's essential to prepare companies

96
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,400
to also be compliant on the german

97
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,000
market to guide them through the storms

98
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,198
of the federal

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,160
requirements across germany we have many

100
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,199
many federal agencies that are dealing

101
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,840
with

102
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,520
depending on where you set up your

103
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,478
company so that's

104
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:36,639
really critical on how to deal

105
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,639
to deal with them in the requirements

106
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,960
so let's talk about the german market we

107
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:45,439
saw some numbers this morning on how

108
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,319
many drugs are

109
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,918
being

110
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,959
prescribed by being hand marketed

111
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,039
and

112
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,039
to my understanding when we look back

113
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,360
into

114
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,520
2017 and compare it to today

115
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,319
we can see that

116
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,439
neil

117
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:06,800
approximately tenfold of increase was

118
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:08,959
seen over those years on on the amount

119
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,319
of product being being

120
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,319
prescribed and used

121
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:18,959
what what are the estimations alessandro

122
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,360
for the years to come

123
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:24,719
what what kind of numbers do you use

124
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,520
internally or try to

125
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,280
yeah

126
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:30,879
estimate your

127
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:33,758
your sales upon okay so um

128
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,759
yeah this this is the this um so we get

129
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,600
approached by this question a lot from

130
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,520
from from people coming outside of

131
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,639
germany mainly of course because if you

132
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,319
want to enter the german market the

133
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,960
first question that you ask is how big

134
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,399
is the german market right now

135
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,959
of course there are numbers i think that

136
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:52,000
the politicians all stated 30 million

137
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,079
currently this number is semi-correct

138
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,160
because this is the amount that has been

139
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,079
applied for import which doesn't mean

140
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,919
that it is the amount that is actually

141
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,599
imported we had a short discussion

142
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:03,439
before before this panel and i think we

143
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,840
kind of all agree that we expect

144
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,918
somewhere between 12 and 15 tons of

145
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,679
medical cannabis this year

146
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,719
flowers being imported into germany

147
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,038
mainly so this is the the

148
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,479
actual size question

149
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,318
and this would be probably the correct

150
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,879
answer

151
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,919
if you are looking into the future

152
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,519
then it's

153
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:24,799
it's becoming very interesting because

154
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,159
there are many different approaches

155
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,720
there are a few companies producing

156
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,759
reports uh on how big it could be and

157
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,759
what the scenarios are

158
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,279
we

159
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,199
maybe give some some nimbus inside how

160
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,038
do we approach uh approach our

161
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,639
expectations in the next years

162
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:44,318
um we do have some saturated medical

163
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,560
markets in the world being it the

164
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,800
canadian one being at the israeli one

165
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,478
and we use a top-down approach where we

166
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,319
say okay uh what percentage of the

167
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,199
population per year

168
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,120
um is a medicinal cannabis patient and

169
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,680
then you get to receive numbers between

170
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,680
0.8 percent and something like 1.5

171
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,000
percent for the israeli market so

172
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,000
calculating it back to germany

173
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,279
would mean that we would expect under

174
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
the current conditions so being in

175
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:14,559
flower drama and an extract somewhere

176
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,240
between 650 and 1.2 million patients

177
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,680
if it's going to happen within two years

178
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,840
three years four years five years we do

179
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,800
not know um but these are the numbers

180
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,719
that we are handling um currently so

181
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,680
this is our look outlook how big the

182
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,680
market is going to be

183
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,000
now the bigger question is if it comes

184
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,079
to legalization to which degree comes it

185
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,160
comes to legalization in

186
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,318
we do have a

187
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,599
quite good source which is the world

188
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,240
drug report

189
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,918
which measures the prevalence of

190
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,840
cannabis consume

191
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:46,560
in different countries

192
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:48,318
so

193
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,478
illegal cannabis consume

194
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,479
consumption in most countries so far and

195
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,399
for germany it's between four and five

196
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:55,598
percent and it's quite constant um

197
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,318
through the years

198
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:58,000
so

199
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,360
under an assumption that maybe this is

200
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,079
going to be the path that's going to be

201
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,520
taken by germany um

202
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:06,079
companies could adjust the business

203
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:07,918
cases to to those kind of numbers um and

204
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,279
that that is basically the expectations

205
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:10,240
that we are managing

206
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,279
um

207
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,038
which if you really calculated are a

208
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,038
little bit lower uh the outcome is a

209
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:19,598
little bit lower than um that what is

210
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:22,318
expected by current reports um but you

211
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:25,038
cannot really foresee the future

212
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,120
um one argument always pops up is yeah

213
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,199
okay but the prevalence of the

214
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,800
let's say gray or black market in in

215
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,000
canada pre-legalization after

216
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,399
legalization um is between 20-25 percent

217
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,440
so every fourth or every fifth person

218
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:42,879
tries at least cannabis once um

219
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,320
in in canada per year

220
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,320
and that's the question is it going to

221
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,800
increase from four or five percent to 20

222
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,120
25 percent in germany as well we do not

223
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:53,199
know what we can see is that even prior

224
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,600
to legalization the prevalence of

225
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,759
cannabis use in canada was already 20 to

226
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,399
25 percent so

227
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:02,000
uh legalization didn't really increase

228
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,559
the number it just changed from black

229
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,159
market to to to recreational market so

230
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:09,278
this is what

231
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,559
i as as or what we as nimbus um and i'm

232
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,958
sure there are pretty pretty diverging

233
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,799
opinions about this um would expect from

234
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:17,759
the german market so

235
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:20,719
if it stays um in a medical

236
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,799
range um we would assume it it's we

237
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,879
follow a saturation curve that at some

238
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,799
point is going to to reach somewhere

239
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:30,240
between 0.8 to 1.5 percent of the

240
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:32,879
population if we move towards um

241
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,560
recreational um we expect that the

242
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,080
saturation curve will tops out at

243
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,838
somewhere between five four and five

244
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,920
percent of the population

245
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,560
but of course also looking at the at the

246
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,319
canadian market only because it's the

247
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,399
recreation is legalized it doesn't mean

248
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,399
that the black market is completely um

249
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,000
taken out of the picture so and the four

250
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,399
or five percent you always need to

251
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,679
include the black market figures into it

252
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,519
um so

253
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,439
this would be my my answer to the

254
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,959
question how big is the is the german

255
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,480
market

256
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,399
now um

257
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,360
as a pharmacist i look at the medicinal

258
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,360
cannabis site only and and looking at

259
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,600
the

260
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,159
setup of the german

261
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,079
agency with the

262
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,000
let's say domestic

263
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,639
production plans

264
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,200
it's clear that additional

265
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,399
importation is currently required and

266
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,839
will

267
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:29,039
may be required for a longer time

268
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,600
maybe alessandro you can outline how

269
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,120
different are the supply scenarios you

270
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,240
see at the moment

271
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,959
but

272
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,839
try try to not go into too much detail

273
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,278
but maybe list a few different types we

274
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,120
see

275
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,600
so you mean how how companies can enter

276
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,600
the german market that is the question

277
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,120
okay so it's

278
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,399
for me it's a multi-dimensional question

279
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,679
so the the first to be short is set up

280
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,679
so let's assume you're coming from

281
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,120
outside of the european union

282
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:58,399
and you want to do everything on your

283
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,200
own um

284
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,679
you would need to have a local

285
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,440
subsidiary holding licenses of course

286
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:09,039
for narcotics trade and uh and well gdp

287
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,880
license and also narcotics license of

288
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:12,399
course but if you're importing from

289
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,919
outside of the eu you will quickly

290
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,639
realize that at some point you need to

291
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,559
store your product somewhere as well as

292
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,159
being able to import from non-eu also

293
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:22,399
within you and to batch release products

294
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,600
within within germany so suddenly you're

295
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,600
moving from

296
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,600
having a subsidiary with a few licenses

297
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,240
to a full gmp

298
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,680
license stack that you need so this is

299
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,159
from the let's say if this is like

300
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,078
x-axis this would be solution number one

301
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,199
of course

302
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,039
the

303
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,399
vast majority of companies do not need

304
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:41,919
and do not require the full license

305
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,839
stack but also goes to the other

306
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,199
complete direction where you can

307
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,640
work with

308
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,399
companies such as nimbles but also

309
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,838
cansativa basically

310
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,759
and and others who do have the full

311
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,079
license stack

312
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:55,439
where you can lease out licenses and

313
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:59,039
thereby

314
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,600
you do not need to have

315
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:04,159
your own fully licensed subsidiary here

316
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,680
in germany and it also goes as far and

317
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,838
this is something that what what we for

318
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,838
example do with with althea that you do

319
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,480
not even have to have a subsidiary in

320
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,480
the market because a company can

321
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,720
represent you on the german market and

322
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,560
fulfill all the licenses that you need

323
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,440
also warehousing and commissioning

324
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,078
and

325
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,399
if we then look in particular to the

326
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:29,919
german situation and the

327
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,000
changes we had in the drug act in 2019

328
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,000
this is when the german market really

329
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,799
opened and i

330
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,360
was proud to find out that

331
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:42,399
this was quite an innovative step on

332
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,839
from our company so that's nice to

333
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,039
realize there can be a few

334
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,760
um

335
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:53,039
yes and for me it was interesting to see

336
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,240
that they go for a similar setup like

337
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,639
the dutch

338
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,320
agency with the

339
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,680
specific state organized distribution

340
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,519
and

341
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,239
i would like to find out

342
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,440
or

343
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,039
ask you benedict to share a bit uh from

344
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,920
your perspective

345
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,799
what are the players in this setting and

346
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,838
yeah

347
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:18,639
what value does it bring to have that

348
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,639
yeah that's a very good question i think

349
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,639
okay

350
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,360
yeah that's a good very good question uh

351
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:30,638
thanks for that so um there are mainly

352
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,600
three key stakeholders that are

353
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,079
involved in the process of the domestic

354
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,480
cannabis program so first of all there

355
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:40,879
are cultivators three companies i think

356
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,120
they were mentioned quite often today

357
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:46,320
already aurora afria and

358
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,440
dimikan they are contract manufacturing

359
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:54,240
organizations for the cannabis agency so

360
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:56,720
basically they produce 2.6 up to 3.9

361
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,399
tonnes of medical cannabis flowers a

362
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,199
year

363
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,679
with

364
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:06,559
more or less three different types thc

365
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:09,919
high thc medium and a balanced product

366
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:12,159
and they sell this product actually to

367
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:15,120
to the cannabis agency which is part of

368
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:18,000
db farm so the owner of the product

369
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,078
would be then the cannabis agency which

370
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,440
is the second key stakeholder within

371
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:26,638
this domestic cannabis program

372
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,959
and they also control the

373
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,799
manufacturers when it comes to harvest

374
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,559
to testing to packaging and all that

375
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:33,919
stuff

376
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,319
and they

377
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:39,360
are the owner of the product until it is

378
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,560
distributed to the pharmacies and for

379
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,680
this distribution there is a exclusive

380
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:47,439
partner of a cannabis agency which is

381
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:48,879
canzativa so

382
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,199
which is us

383
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:54,240
and we are shipping those products on

384
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:56,078
behalf of bay farm into the

385
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,198
pharmacy so this is basically how it's

386
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:59,759
set up

387
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:02,559
in general so so the orders from the

388
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,639
pharmacies would be

389
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:07,759
going to the bee farm which is then

390
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:11,360
informing you or directly to you so

391
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:14,159
you're ordering on behalf of a pharmacy

392
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,278
so what happens is that at b farm there

393
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:19,600
is no handling of the product at all so

394
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:20,879
that's the first important thing so it's

395
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
stored

396
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,399
at

397
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,680
either the cultivator site or

398
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,958
in our distribution hub and we are

399
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:32,239
receiving the orders from the pharmacies

400
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:35,838
directly

401
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,440
but always we act here on behalf of of

402
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,680
beef farm

403
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,880
when you look into the market sometimes

404
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:45,519
the pharmacist might not differentiate

405
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:49,120
is he now talking to us as cancer teva

406
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,480
or is he talking to the cannabis agency

407
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,278
who are

408
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,920
yeah

409
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:56,639
the actual owner of this domestic

410
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:59,278
cannabis so so one last question so you

411
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:03,120
were then actually also audited by the

412
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:05,278
bee farm to check on on your premises or

413
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,480
yeah absolutely so last year there was

414
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:08,480
the

415
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,360
tender process on the distribution

416
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,120
of

417
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,480
the medical cannabis

418
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,198
from germany

419
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,440
18 companies applied for

420
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:18,639
this tender process we made the race

421
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,920
which was good

422
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:24,639
but we also were audited by the cannabis

423
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:27,198
agency last year in summer

424
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,079
which was quite a rough audit when you

425
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,039
compare it to like other supplier audits

426
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,319
or so

427
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:36,399
what we also used used to in the past

428
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,959
so like you just mentioned there are

429
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,679
different players in this domestic field

430
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:45,119
and demi khan is the one who is

431
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:46,239
cultivating i assume you then also would

432
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,560
expect

433
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,639
to get inspected or um yeah by the bee

434
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:56,239
farm and and maybe you can talk a bit

435
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:59,839
about how high the requirements are by

436
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,240
uh given by by the license you won

437
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,440
recently um and

438
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,640
yeah

439
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,838
how how would you say um is it equal

440
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,559
between you and a cultivator from abroad

441
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,318
or to put it directly there is quite

442
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:17,038
some difference between

443
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:18,959
the level of expectations and maybe yeah

444
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:22,798
or requirements maybe you can comment on

445
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,959
that yeah i'm happy to do so so um yes

446
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,199
we will be inspected by the bee farm by

447
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,798
the cannabis agency in fact we're in

448
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,840
constant contact with the cannabis

449
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,759
agency we have a monthly call they check

450
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:36,798
on the progress of the build out the

451
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:38,160
progress of the cultivation and yes they

452
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,160
will audit us

453
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,120
though roughly once

454
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,558
we are ready to be audited which

455
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:46,479
is going to be

456
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,879
at the end of this year and we're

457
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:53,120
expecting to deliver medical cannabis

458
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,000
flowers into the market in q1 2022

459
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:56,959
so

460
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,079
you will have our product soon

461
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,880
um

462
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:03,279
now other requirements for us as medical

463
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,799
cannabis producers in germany higher

464
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,599
than for other medical cannabis

465
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:10,000
producers be it in the european union or

466
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:13,359
outside of european union yes

467
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,359
first of all in germany we have to grow

468
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:17,439
medical cannabis and process medical

469
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,558
cannabis in a bunker

470
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,320
so

471
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:22,960
for example in canada you have high

472
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:25,359
security protocols but it is basically

473
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,720
video cameras all over the place

474
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:30,319
we have to build a bunker and grow and

475
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,120
process in the bunker

476
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:34,558
so

477
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:36,479
that is already a big challenge then

478
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,160
when it comes to the cultivation of

479
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,360
medical cannabis

480
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,000
we partook in a tender process which we

481
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:46,319
won and we were rated

482
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,240
first of all on the price

483
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,079
but secondly also on the quality

484
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,640
concepts how we are going to grow

485
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:54,720
medical cannabis and we could only win

486
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,120
this tender process by demonstrating

487
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,200
that we will grow medical cannabis in

488
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,879
superior quality and from a

489
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,960
pharmaceutical standpoint superior

490
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,080
quality means that the active

491
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:09,600
pharmaceutical ingredients which are tc

492
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:12,319
and cbd will be constant between batches

493
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:14,719
and within a batch so um

494
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,960
yeah we had to demonstrate that and we

495
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,798
could only win the tender because we

496
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,279
were demonstrating that it would be of

497
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,960
higher quality so the expectation for

498
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:25,759
our product is higher than the

499
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,279
expectation for producers in europe or

500
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,440
outside of europe

501
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,918
and um

502
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,000
cultivating medical cannabis is one part

503
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,400
of the story the other part is

504
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,640
processing medical cannabis and here

505
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,640
comes eu gmp into play

506
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,960
because actually we're cultivating under

507
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,480
gacp though it is in clean room

508
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,000
environment

509
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:52,960
the product then has to be trimmed dried

510
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,759
stored packaged and delivered to to the

511
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,640
customer in the end and

512
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:00,240
for that we had to demonstrate that we

513
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,679
will become a pharmaceutical company

514
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,558
which we are by now

515
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,440
and

516
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:08,639
so we not only build those cultivation

517
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,279
rooms but also all the gmp area to

518
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,880
process medical cannabis allowing us to

519
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,399
actually build a center for medical

520
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,200
cannabis

521
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,360
processing our own product but also

522
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,319
allowing product to come in from other

523
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:23,839
european countries be processed so come

524
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,558
in as an active pharmaceutical

525
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:31,359
ingredient and then be refined into eu

526
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:32,319
gmp product flour or extract

527
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,798
so

528
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:37,439
that means the license which you got

529
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:40,240
defines quite

530
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,558
detailed how you produce it it would

531
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,359
then also define what kind of product

532
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:46,960
you're allowed to bring to the market

533
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:50,158
and i would be

534
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:53,840
curious to find out how much did the bee

535
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:56,240
farm really look into understanding

536
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:58,000
what what our patients needs what our

537
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,240
needs related to all the different

538
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,720
indications i know there's a huge

539
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,400
discussion going about what type of

540
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,720
product is the right one um

541
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,798
how are you dealing with that

542
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,279
because i assume the bee farm would then

543
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:15,839
solidly concentrate on the monographs

544
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,759
and what's what's written in them or

545
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:19,519
maybe you can outline how this

546
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:22,319
discussion goes about

547
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:25,279
yeah well monographs are kind of kicked

548
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:27,279
off at the bee farm so they have kind of

549
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,599
control and direction how the monograph

550
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:32,480
will be written during monograph and

551
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:34,319
also uh sending impulses for the

552
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,480
european union so that the european

553
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,319
monograph will be uh

554
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,640
in line with the dab

555
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:43,119
monograph the german monograph

556
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,960
and so first of all you have to look at

557
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,158
who is sitting in the cannabis agency so

558
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,600
what is the background they're

559
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,640
pharmacists

560
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,038
so

561
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,440
they're not medical doctors

562
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:56,720
they're not looking at what

563
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,840
cultivar and terpene profile will be

564
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,960
best for this or that indication they

565
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:05,599
look at medicare cannabis as a

566
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,798
api and for them there are two main

567
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:11,678
ingredients this is thc and cbd and they

568
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:13,519
basically set out this tender process in

569
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,600
that they wanted a high

570
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:18,319
tc cultivar

571
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:22,240
a medium thc cultivar and a balanced tc

572
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:23,519
cultiva meaning that 18 to 22 percent of

573
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,880
tc

574
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:29,839
16 to 12 percent tc and a balanced one

575
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,640
with five to nine percent thc and cbd

576
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:32,000
and

577
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,000
that's it

578
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,159
terpenes at

579
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,480
that point in time were not of

580
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,280
consideration they become more and more

581
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,798
now

582
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,038
so this is

583
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,038
advice to everybody wanting to bring

584
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,038
product to the german market have a look

585
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:48,400
at your terpene profile how does it

586
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:50,798
differentiate

587
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,080
from the other products in the market

588
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:56,000
and the b farm now has awareness of of

589
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,319
that

590
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,319
thanks

591
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:07,000
now we are all through my notes here

592
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:18,080
um if if i look at the requirements for

593
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,720
gmp production and

594
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:23,439
i know they then should be added to the

595
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,960
gacp requirements

596
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,360
we have those

597
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:32,519
being looked at by the bee farm

598
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:34,240
we also have requirements towards the

599
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:38,319
non-european

600
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:41,359
producers so maybe tony you can outline

601
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:44,480
what challenges do you see when it comes

602
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:47,599
to products coming maybe from your site

603
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:52,319
in europe but also comparing it to

604
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:55,359
those coming from further abroad

605
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:59,678
it's it's my experiences that company

606
00:23:55,359 --> 00:24:03,199
countries like israel know also start um

607
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,679
coming into the play in in discussing or

608
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,240
yeah setting their standards up to the

609
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,798
european ones

610
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,480
so where do you see the main challenges

611
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:13,759
in this

612
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,519
like say

613
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:17,839
none balance

614
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:21,119
because that's what we experience

615
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:22,720
here and maybe you can outline that

616
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:26,319
well we have the

617
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,960
the famous eugmp and they're very

618
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,879
fine-tuned guidelines existing already

619
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,120
i know that all european state

620
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,320
inspectors they're following the ugmp

621
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:35,839
guidelines

622
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:37,278
that's that's

623
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:38,879
that's basically what the what's on the

624
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:40,159
agenda on every state inspection what

625
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,039
they're doing

626
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:45,200
with other words the european suppliers

627
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:46,798
they they always have the the same

628
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,240
criteria how they how the quality will

629
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:50,158
be controlled and

630
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,240
stately inspected

631
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,320
plus on top the audits that the clients

632
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,679
or us as wholesale distributors who get

633
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:57,278
the products from the suppliers in we

634
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,919
have to qualify them as well we have to

635
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,359
perform audits which is exactly the same

636
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,559
like a statement spectred but code

637
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:04,000
ordered

638
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:06,879
and

639
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,119
i don't see the biggest problems there

640
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,039
there is differences between is somebody

641
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,439
producing cannabis flowers or

642
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,359
does somebody have an extraction

643
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,558
a facility

644
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:21,038
and a big big difference is also then do

645
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:23,440
they irradiate the product to reduce a

646
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:25,679
micro burden or germs

647
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,320
which i will say in a couple of minutes

648
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,640
leads to other regulatory problems with

649
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,960
with beef harm

650
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,960
overall i can see there's

651
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,840
still not enough product available from

652
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,038
foreign

653
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:38,879
suppliers

654
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:40,558
so the wholesale distributors are

655
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,320
desperately always looking

656
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:44,639
to get new products in not only for

657
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:47,599
medical reasons where uh cornelius said

658
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,000
it very correctly we need to look into

659
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:52,399
more details of the medical effects of

660
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,159
the cannabis plants and also pointing at

661
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,798
the terpene profiles for example and the

662
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,840
interaction with the cannabinoids

663
00:25:56,798 --> 00:25:59,759
anyway

664
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,519
we still need more product and there are

665
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:03,359
still not enough european suppliers that

666
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,400
are fully compliant to get product into

667
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:06,959
germany

668
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,960
as currently we still have the the

669
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,720
famous dutch products

670
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,919
which is also irrigated

671
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,558
flowers and we've got a huge amount

672
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,799
as supply from denmark currently

673
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:21,119
but almost on a weekly basis we get now

674
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:23,440
also from third countries from non-eu

675
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,759
member countries a product in now as

676
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,360
well which gets fully fully licensed but

677
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:28,558
that is actually a very tricky part

678
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:29,918
because

679
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:31,839
non-eu

680
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,840
member production needs to be compliant

681
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:35,439
with eu gmp they all call them

682
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,038
manufacturing

683
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,558
gmp compliance

684
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:40,480
but they don't even know what's in the

685
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:41,918
european guidelines but they are the

686
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,120
ones that matter

687
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,080
and

688
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:46,719
hence

689
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:49,359
it leads to a time problem because the

690
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,200
the law says a european state

691
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:53,678
inspectorate needs

692
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,600
to do a state inspection in whatever

693
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,559
country there is that wants to export to

694
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:58,558
germany

695
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:00,319
yeah and we recently had the news

696
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:02,158
jamaica in that case

697
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,759
they got their products compliant i wish

698
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,880
i was the state com inspector there you

699
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:06,400
know performing

700
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,480
the audit or the inspection must have

701
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,600
been funny with regular music but

702
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,000
um

703
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:14,000
they managed yeah we're in contact with

704
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
lots of other producers in third

705
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,798
countries like

706
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,359
australia like certain african companies

707
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:23,038
states sorry and we even contact that

708
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,278
with parts of

709
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:27,119
politicians like health ministries etc

710
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:29,278
and consult them what it means to become

711
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,439
a gmp compliant

712
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:33,759
and and due to covert there were a lot

713
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,120
of delays in the inspections by the

714
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:37,919
authorities

715
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:39,519
i think they did or i was part of some

716
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,278
which were held

717
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:44,639
virtually in case there's not much risk

718
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:48,558
but

719
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,559
especially specifically those sites

720
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:52,720
which are far broad

721
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:54,079
i'm sure they delayed in their

722
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,960
inspections

723
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:59,038
um

724
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,038
does does that impact any of your

725
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:04,000
partners obviously i i even can give the

726
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,679
the time you know

727
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,079
uh given a

728
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,278
a company gets ready or things is ready

729
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:13,599
for eugmp compliance

730
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:15,919
um it takes up to a year before a german

731
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,599
inspector it goes out there and performs

732
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,919
the inspection you know we're already

733
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:21,678
setting up now

734
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,440
for inspections in canada and australia

735
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,640
you know with one year ahead to get

736
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,480
these things done

737
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,159
there are massive delays so with other

738
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,759
words the german spectres might be

739
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,919
understaffed let's put it that way you

740
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:34,879
know let's talk about solutions here

741
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:38,080
and um that has an impact another impact

742
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,799
is maybe if i swap over quickly to the

743
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:42,960
uh regulator regulatory side of cannabis

744
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,398
flowers that are being irradiated which

745
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,399
at the moment the highest amount on the

746
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,479
german market is irradiated because

747
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:50,639
they're being produced in greenhouses

748
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,599
and you have to reduce the micro burn

749
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,679
so

750
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:56,558
in holland they irradiate with gamma

751
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,640
that's a very intensive radiation for

752
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:02,480
cannabis flowers has an impact on the

753
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,919
only ingredients on the quality as well

754
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,440
the authorities don't mind because as

755
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,520
long as they stay within the specs all

756
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:11,120
is good you know so but the consumer the

757
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:11,119
patients there will become more and more

758
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:14,719
picky is the wrong word you know but

759
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,600
sophisticated is maybe the the right

760
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,240
word

761
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:20,959
uh in denmark we radiate the product now

762
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,519
with uh electronic beams

763
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,759
uh that's much much nicer a way to

764
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:27,359
reduce the micro burn without having an

765
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:28,960
impact on the

766
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,278
on the substances

767
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,399
and but now what i really wanted to say

768
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:33,759
is

769
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:36,398
the german beef farm they have a

770
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,839
department is called already

771
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:39,199
it's

772
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:42,240
just like

773
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,080
irradiated license issuing department

774
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,599
you know it's called amrit power it's

775
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,519
it's a law text that clearly says that

776
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:49,599
any substances that has been irradiated

777
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,759
has to have a license with a licensed

778
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:53,439
number that needs to be printed on the

779
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,759
label of each single product and it's

780
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,120
related to the product name and now with

781
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,359
everything what my colleagues here said

782
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:01,359
before you know how hard it was

783
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:03,519
the to build up distribution channels

784
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:05,519
you know so from cultivation and all

785
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,519
these different manufacturing steps not

786
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:10,720
only the first gmp it's also the

787
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:12,798
labeling filling packaging etc gmp and

788
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,759
gdp laws we go through all these efforts

789
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:16,079
and then in the end of the day you

790
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:18,240
cannot bring the market the product on

791
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,480
the market without this radiation

792
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,359
license and to get that that takes at

793
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,240
least 10 months yes i know it's like

794
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:28,398
little dossier for a product so it is

795
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,278
quite extensive

796
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:35,278
since we would like to also allow the

797
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:38,319
audience for some questions

798
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,679
maybe i can ask each one of you to say

799
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:42,158
one to two

800
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,159
sentences of

801
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,240
then we don't get to the questions you

802
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,520
mean

803
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,679
okay then let's open for questions first

804
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,119
i think it would be nice to

805
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,919
give you some

806
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:55,918
opportunity

807
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:00,479
oh

808
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,360
yeah all right no one had one or two

809
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,079
sentences no let's start okay one or two

810
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:07,759
paragraphs is marlon

811
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,678
so i have a question regarding the

812
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:11,440
standardization of the cannabis flower

813
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,919
and the metabolic content so to

814
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,519
contextualize i am a biochemist and a

815
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,000
medicinal chemist i teach at a

816
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:20,159
university in colombia a medicinal

817
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,960
cannabis and a big part of my research

818
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,640
is analyzing the metabolic diversity of

819
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,319
cannabis chemicals cultivated in

820
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,840
colombia so we have

821
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:29,439
cooperation with different companies in

822
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:32,480
colombia different regions on the

823
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,679
cordilleras and we analyze the trapenoid

824
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,200
profile and try to establish

825
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,759
correlations to

826
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,679
identify potentially new metabolic

827
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:41,200
profiles so what i've realized in my

828
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,960
research is that

829
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,360
the cannabis flower can be very

830
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,120
heterogeneous even within the same plant

831
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:48,158
depending if you have the top butt or

832
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:49,918
the bottom

833
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,080
so i wonder okay when you have to

834
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,120
guarantee the um

835
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:55,439
um

836
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:57,678
chemical identity of a whole batch i

837
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,759
mean if it's hard within the same plant

838
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,640
when you have tons of it how can you

839
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:05,038
guarantee that um that they may every

840
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,320
flower on the on the on the bus would be

841
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:09,200
identical i mean my impression is like

842
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:11,678
yeah

843
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,399
uh harvesting your flowers and expecting

844
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,240
them to be identical is like buying

845
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:18,719
grapes and expect that all of them are

846
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,720
identically ripe so it's not how plant

847
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,079
biology works so how you

848
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,880
over am yeah overcome this issue this

849
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:30,639
fundamentally biological issue to comply

850
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,919
with the regulation which is very strict

851
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,960
thanks for the question i think

852
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:37,200
cornelius would be a good one to answer

853
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,360
so maybe i can answer for the b firm the

854
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,440
b farm overcame this challenge by

855
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:43,278
deciding that they wanted all medical

856
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,159
cannabis that is being produced in

857
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:48,798
germany to produce in indoor

858
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:51,760
facilities so full control on all

859
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:55,519
environmental parameters allowing for a

860
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:58,640
reproducible result now this is

861
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,640
the high pharmaceutical quality product

862
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,759
you can obtain and there you will get

863
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,840
more

864
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:06,319
a more homogeneous product within the

865
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:09,199
batch or and between badges however it

866
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:11,839
won't will never be in a whole room all

867
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,880
equal every flower every plant

868
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,879
but you can reduce the variance now next

869
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,760
level is greenhouse production and there

870
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,278
you should opt for a producer that has a

871
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:23,359
hybrid greenhouse

872
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:26,079
with additional lighting

873
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:28,959
shading blackout options

874
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:31,119
air condition would be very nice and is

875
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,319
randomly seen

876
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:36,639
and then you have greenhouse is without

877
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:39,678
any technical

878
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,320
additions they are as

879
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,960
bad or as difficult for a homogeneous

880
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:47,839
product as greenfield production so

881
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,519
there you have the gradients and this is

882
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:52,639
the reason why the bee farm opted for

883
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,960
indoor and you addressed before the

884
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,679
question are there differences between

885
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,079
the products yes here it is grown indoor

886
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,759
and currently into germany it's flowing

887
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,119
product being mainly produced in

888
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:04,839
greenhouses

889
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:06,798
some of them hybrid

890
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:08,639
greenhouses so

891
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:10,320
um i'm just wondering too would

892
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,599
extraction or something like that help

893
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,359
to create more

894
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,599
consistent results

895
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:17,918
i mean i'm a flower guy

896
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,559
but

897
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:23,039
yeah absolutely but um then again you

898
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:25,039
you want to have a high quality product

899
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:26,159
to produce high quality extracts with a

900
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:29,279
bad

901
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,760
biomass you will not obtain high quality

902
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,440
extracts if there's some some metals

903
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,919
inside or pesticides they will

904
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,440
accumulate and well yeah

905
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,838
yeah i would also add to that that

906
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,918
there's fda guidance for growing

907
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:43,440
botanical medicines as well which talks

908
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,638
about defining your batch size so

909
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,760
everything starts with how many plants

910
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,679
you're growing of that particular

911
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,440
variety we have things like harvest

912
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,358
batches which indicate what strains were

913
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,960
planted on what day under what specific

914
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,199
environment so absolutely environmental

915
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,878
control but then you have to homogenize

916
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,960
the batch enough that when you pull

917
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:01,598
samples and you pull a sufficient sample

918
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,440
size you're getting a margin of

919
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,280
tolerance that is replica that is

920
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,039
reflective of what it is that you're

921
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,880
trying to meet quality standard on so

922
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,639
these are the ways to kind of do that

923
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,559
sorry mark saw with i comply i have a

924
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:15,039
quick question just regarding

925
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:16,960
um the cost of production it sounds like

926
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:18,559
in germany to cultivate

927
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,320
cannabis is going to be an expensive

928
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:22,480
endeavor you've got a lot of regulatory

929
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,320
agencies cost of electricity isn't the

930
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,079
cheapest so i'm curious if you

931
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,079
calculated what your cost of goods sold

932
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,760
is going to look like and how that's

933
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,839
comparative to

934
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,720
cheaper imports that are coming up in

935
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,320
the game

936
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:36,239
and how do you think the price

937
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,119
difference is going to look

938
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:38,799
now

939
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,960
we participate in the first standard

940
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,000
because we wanted to be a first mover

941
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,400
but at the same time the bee farm made a

942
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,239
constraint on everybody that wanted to

943
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:52,160
apply to

944
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:53,199
offer something that allows you to

945
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:55,519
run your

946
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:57,759
business profitable so we had to

947
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:59,679
calculate a price that would allow us to

948
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,160
cover the cost of goods

949
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:03,838
and the overheads so actually we were

950
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:05,679
offering a higher price than our two

951
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:07,440
competitors the one in the

952
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:10,879
public tender

953
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,960
much higher as i believe and we were

954
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,200
only able to win the standard because

955
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,358
our quality concepts were

956
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:19,439
in a way that pleased the bee farm and

957
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:21,759
allowed for a high pharmaceutical

958
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,760
product

959
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:24,960
very informative and well structured

960
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,519
panel thank you very much to the

961
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,358
moderator and the panelists uh i would i

962
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,759
would like to ask you alessandro

963
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:33,358
mentioned some of the critical

964
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,280
approach uh

965
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,119
and we heard about some of the major

966
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,240
players but can you just briefly

967
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,320
summarize a road map we have a manufa a

968
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:44,879
growing and uh extracting facility in

969
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,920
north macedonia can you summarize

970
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,760
a brief road map and a timeline

971
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,039
what is going to take to enter the

972
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,040
german market thank you

973
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:56,719
okay so on on a timeline take that easy

974
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,519
question

975
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:01,919
yeah wait it's it's a big question um so

976
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:04,719
on the timeline as mentioned you should

977
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,639
have a ugmp license in place at some

978
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:08,399
point of course in macedonia there is

979
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:09,679
also some political regulatory issues

980
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,838
that

981
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:14,239
yeah does not allow exports so far but

982
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:15,920
it will come at some point

983
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:18,479
and then you need to pick and choose

984
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:21,280
your market entry strategy

985
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,199
you can produce for other companies who

986
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,720
put then of course white label

987
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,639
is that you can white label the brand

988
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:27,679
and they then it's up to them to enter

989
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:30,559
the market

990
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:32,078
or what is what is from my perspective

991
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,320
the more interesting part is to be

992
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,960
present on the market as a brand so if

993
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,200
you choose to go that way

994
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,720
you need to choose your setup so are you

995
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:45,358
going to have a subsidiary in germany as

996
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,959
a running company is the subsidiary also

997
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:50,078
going to be the one

998
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,480
who has a gdp and narcotics license or

999
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,800
do you say no we don't need any of this

1000
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,559
and you choose a partner to work with

1001
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,480
who is going to be let's say your joint

1002
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,880
venture partner at some point

1003
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,519
and represents you in the german market

1004
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,680
so that's that's the setup question that

1005
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:08,719
needs to be solved first

1006
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:12,078
it of course there's benefits and and uh

1007
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:13,519
and contraindications to to every each

1008
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,280
setup

1009
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:19,199
which has to do with costs and benefit

1010
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,519
and risks scenarios but then what

1011
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:23,279
what also the title of this panel is is

1012
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:26,079
how to get shelf

1013
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,839
shelf space in pharmacies then once you

1014
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,599
are here and you have everything in

1015
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:30,960
place and your cannabis products are

1016
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,559
sitting here the question is how do you

1017
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,960
approach the market

1018
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:37,759
do you approach the market via

1019
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,000
being let's say self-payers or

1020
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,400
patient focused who do not have

1021
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,039
insurance health insurance coverage

1022
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,800
for that of course price and to some

1023
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:49,599
degree marketing is key

1024
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,960
um but on the other hand um if you want

1025
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,320
to go the the full medical road i'm sure

1026
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,000
you've heard the pharmacist before you

1027
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,160
need to generate prescriptions at some

1028
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,039
point so you need to convince doctors

1029
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:02,078
that

1030
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:04,960
prescribing your product is somehow

1031
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:08,079
better superior or equal to products who

1032
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,880
are already on the market um so you you

1033
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,560
know now you have to to think about um

1034
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,720
yeah setting up a

1035
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:17,199
proper pharmacy salesforce doctor

1036
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:19,118
salesforce um that really really

1037
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:20,960
goes to each doctor knocks on every door

1038
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,960
and and tells them about you and your

1039
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,679
products so a lot of scenarios going

1040
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:29,039
from we only produce and send over white

1041
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:31,679
label to we produce and are present with

1042
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:34,960
our own brand on onto the market

1043
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:35,838
um to watch our scenario uh up to we are

1044
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,079
going

1045
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,078
with which strategy you choose to go are

1046
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,240
we going to be the more

1047
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,079
self paying market uh approach are we

1048
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:46,479
going to be the more more pure medical

1049
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,640
approach so there's a lot of questions

1050
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,599
um and and pathways that needs to be

1051
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,480
chosen

1052
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,880
um

1053
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,320
but i think everybody of us is open to

1054
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,079
to have a chat

1055
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,920
with you because we do have plenty of

1056
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,440
companies on the german market uh who

1057
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,280
are interestingly

1058
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,280
choosing each and every time a different

1059
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,040
scenario um and now we can see how the

1060
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,440
scenarios play out and which to have

1061
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:09,599
success and which to heavenly success

1062
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,200
but i think one big question we should

1063
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:15,280
address is

1064
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:19,439
whether you as a producer actually have

1065
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,440
to undergo eugmp certification

1066
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:23,358
if you do it will take time

1067
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:24,719
tony outlined

1068
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:27,119
now pandemic

1069
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:29,279
inspections are broad or difficult

1070
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,519
maybe it's a virtual inspection very

1071
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,040
difficult but do you have to do it this

1072
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:34,400
is the big question

1073
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:36,880
now if you want to bring your own

1074
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,039
product and have your own subsidiary

1075
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,358
alessandra is totally right we'll take

1076
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,199
the time and this is the path but if you

1077
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:45,119
want to produ if you believe you're good

1078
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:48,480
in producing product high quality

1079
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:50,400
product with low variance in the

1080
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,880
active pharmaceutical ingredients then

1081
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,960
you can actually choose a company in the

1082
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,280
european union or in germany such as

1083
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,519
demican which allows you a platform that

1084
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,359
is eugmp certified and bring in your

1085
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:02,559
product as an active pharmaceutical

1086
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:04,880
ingredient

1087
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:07,599
be it for refinement of the product into

1088
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,280
an extract and we can also market it for

1089
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:12,800
you but we're not the only ones to be

1090
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:15,359
fair so this is another pathway you as a

1091
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,760
producer can take but you have to make a

1092
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:17,759
decision

1093
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:23,598
it's my question before benedict

1094
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,960
uh obviously as the consumer tastes or

1095
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,800
the patient tastes become more

1096
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,039
discerning and that terpene profile

1097
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,318
becomes more important

1098
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:32,239
right now

1099
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:33,679
there's the radiation that's required

1100
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:36,318
for producers in order to hit that

1101
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:37,598
microbial threshold under eugmp

1102
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:39,599
but

1103
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,440
is it important for cultivators moving

1104
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,760
forward to try to figure out how to

1105
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,519
cultivate without radiating or will the

1106
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,240
distribution

1107
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:50,719
desire moving forward continue to demand

1108
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:54,318
that irradiation to mitigate the risk of

1109
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:56,399
products not being accepted into germany

1110
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:58,480
uh yeah very good question so i think

1111
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,240
first of all if you look into the market

1112
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,318
and observe what kind of products are

1113
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:04,159
available you see that there are

1114
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:06,480
products that are radiated and others

1115
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:09,519
are not and you can

1116
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,240
get them prescribed yeah so so this is a

1117
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:14,800
observation where we see that maybe

1118
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:17,519
especially in the more self-paced

1119
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,240
segment they might be more attracted to

1120
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:23,280
those products that are not radiated so

1121
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:25,759
this is something where i believe that

1122
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,480
this is important to understand

1123
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,839
from a pharmaceutical standpoint i would

1124
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,159
be always in favor of irradiation

1125
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:36,318
because as you said

1126
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:37,920
the limits of and certain thresholds

1127
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:40,480
they can't be

1128
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,639
let's say regularly and consistently

1129
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,440
achieved if you don't irradiate so

1130
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:46,400
that's

1131
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,039
my opinion and opinion of our company

1132
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,599
however we see that there is demand for

1133
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:54,318
products that are not irradiated so we

1134
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:57,838
need to somehow as an industry find the

1135
00:42:54,318 --> 00:43:00,000
right way that we bring those products

1136
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:02,880
also in the future into the market that

1137
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,880
are not irradiated

1138
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:07,920
thank you all

1139
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,800
yes thanks a lot and

1140
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,000
do we have the time for each one to say

1141
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,920
uh

1142
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
we don't have the time for one or two

1143
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,920
you had a chance

1144
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,119
you had a chance for one or two lessons

1145
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,119
let's hear it that was very informative

1146
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:31,599
you
