17
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,759
things that you have to think about when

18
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,320
you want to do International Trade of

19
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,640

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,200
Logistics is sometimes something that

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,040
you think it's like uh moving by itself

28
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,118
right but it's not so we will learn a

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,360
little bit about what you should do what

30
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:22,640
you should be aware about and now

31
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:25,438
actually all those uh presentation

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,519
before when we talked about all these

33
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:31,039
opportunities how we actually execute

34
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:33,640

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,479

industry and actually to bring all my

45
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:00,640

93
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,719
two three

94
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:07,759
four

95
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:10,318

96
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:13,959
about Five Guys that's it medical

97
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:17,719
cannabis markets as such five

98
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:19,959
markets six maybe so a lot of stories a

99
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,079
lot of H you know people think that a

100
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,840
lot of countries are joining the party

101
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,800
there's not a lot of markets Market I

102
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:30,038
mean doctors write prescriptions you go

103
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,600
to a pharmacy and you get your product

104
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:35,360
not a lot of market so everybody wants

105
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:39,000
to sell to Germany to Australia to the

106
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,800
UK to Switzerland to

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Israel that's it okay not more or not a

108
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,038
lot more than that and of course new

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,120
import export opportunities in Thailand

110
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:53,478
by by the way not just Thailand there's

111
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,000
a lot of stories about many countries

112
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:57,319
you will hear that there are imports

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,800
from Thailand to Thailand or export out

114
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:02,159
of Thailand

115
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,918
the answer is no there's no clear

116
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,560
regulations over there there's a lot of

117
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:09,359
gray issues so be aware to that there's

118
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,199
a lot of stories but when it comes to

119
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,840
execution make sure that you do

120
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,478
understand the regulations so Logistics

121
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:20,079
when you talk about logistics you have

122
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:22,159
to remember these five pillars one is

123
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:25,639
the Regulatory

124
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,680
Compliance unfortunately with cannabis

125
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,680
there's no or I would say differently I

126
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,879
would say that each country has its own

127
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,079
regulations so whenever you do

128
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,038
International Trade of cannabis be aware

129
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:38,639
that your the exposing country

130
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,240
regulations are not exactly is the

131
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,600
important country regulations and you

132
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:47,240
have to ad to both so regulatory issues

133
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,080
are mainly or probably the main thing

134
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:53,280
that you have to take care of

135
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:56,359
security okay it's a drug it's narcotics

136
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,918
it's a attracting a lot of attention

137
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,879
security is an important point there are

138
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:04,318
some countries that we are not moving

139
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:08,279
even one flower or one LEF unless we

140
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,439
have a armed guard together with a truck

141
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,038
sometimes it's the regulation sometimes

142
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:14,800
we're just doing it even if it's not a

143
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:18,038
regulation so be aware of

144
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,120
security quality insurance guys it's

145
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:24,560
medicines it's exactly like Pharma

146
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,399
medical cannabis is exactly like

147
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,879
any molecule that you can think about

148
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:32,079
paracetamol or anything else it's it's a

149
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:35,279
medicine this is why you have to adhere

150
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:38,639
to all those pharmaceutical requirements

151
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:42,758
GDP and other GMP

152
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,639
regulations expertise yeah cannabis

153
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:47,400
excuse my language cannabis is not

154
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,918
garments from I don't know from from a

155
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:52,399
country to ship cannabis it's a highly

156
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,680
regulated issue and if you ship it and

157
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:57,638
you don't do it right you can Kiss It

158
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,319
Goodbye and I'll say it several times if

159
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:02,840
you arrive to the country of destination

160
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:04,919
and you cannot clear it no way back it

161
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:08,560
you're going to be destroyed and you'll

162
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:11,598
have to pay for it so it's not a regular

163
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,918
thing that you just send it DHL or FedEx

164
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:18,240
or whatever and it's there it's not and

165
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:21,680
the last thing is global uh I think the

166
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,000
one the lecture before me said act local

167
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,280
think Global if you really want to be

168
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,038
there if you really want to do you know

169
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,119
International Trade think

170
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:33,318
Global what we had in 2013 these were

171
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,478
the main Lanes I told you before there

172
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:38,360
are not that many markets so I think

173
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:41,240
that the strongest exporter exporting

174
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,240
country is Canada you know that then we

175
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,158
saw some a lot of um movements from

176
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,000
South Africa either to you EU UK and

177
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:53,519
Australia Portugal

178
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,399
Uruguay and a lot of inra Europe

179
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,079
movements of medical cannabis within

180
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:59,598
Europe from Portugal to Germany to

181
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:02,639
Switzerland to others each one of those

182
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:05,560
Lanes required a completely different

183
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,240
logistic solution and we will talk about

184
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,079
that in a while I you don't need the

185
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,478
numbers there's a lot of H charts that

186
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:16,399
we saw today but you can

187
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:20,158
see the

188
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:22,519
potential Australia look at it they're

189
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:24,360
going to grow dramatically so again

190
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:26,758
numbers and numbers I just want to show

191
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,680
you the the trend that we are going to

192
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:33,120
face more and more and more sales in

193
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,918
different markets which will require

194
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,719
logistic solution at the end of the day

195
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:38,718
you have to move it you have to pick it

196
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,399
up in the site and you have to bring it

197
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,399
to the market whether you like it or not

198
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,278
you have to move it and you have to move

199
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:48,278
it right because if it's not it's not

200
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:50,919
going to help

201
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:54,480
nobody let's talk two slides about

202
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:59,000
regulations okay I can bring you I can I

203
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:02,200
I could have bring here dozens of charts

204
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,958
okay look at Google say cannabis legal

205
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:09,120
something you will get a lot of

206
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:12,599
charts this is for the legal status of

207
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:16,480
cannabis Recreation this is medical this

208
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,680
is another map just name it the reason

209
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,399
I'm putting it here because I want you

210
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:24,599
to make sure that you understand that

211
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:27,360
regulations are moving are changing

212
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,440
every week every week we see some

213
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,720
changes in regulations more countries

214
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:36,240
more changes in the regulations last

215
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,680
year it was Australia this Ser is

216
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,278
Germany Greece Israel it's moving Target

217
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,838
all the time so make sure that you don't

218
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:47,039
stick with one map but you understand

219
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:49,240
the changes that we see every almost

220
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,039
every week

221
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,200
Europe

222
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:58,078
really one of my the Prest presentations

223
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:00,160
where when someone show a list of 12

224
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:02,479
countries in Europe

225
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,439
Malta Portugal

226
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:09,759
Germany U

227
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,680
UK who understand the

228
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:15,480
the regulatory environment in Europe

229
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,479
please raise your

230
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:23,719
hand legal not legal half legal

231
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,320
decriminalized

232
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,879
criminalized another map of Europe

233
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:34,040
right is it right

234
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:36,759
or maybe this one is right same thing

235
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:38,199
it's confusing not like in the farmer

236
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:41,200
world in the fmer world you come to

237
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,920
Europe there's one rule with cannabis

238
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,639
changing all the time CBDs or not THS or

239
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:52,958
not above 0.2 above

240
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:54,799
0.3 whatever okay so Europe is actually

241
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:57,078
different countries in Europe and each

242
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:59,639
one of them is different than the others

243
00:10:57,078 --> 00:11:01,199
so make sure that you do understand that

244
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:03,360
what what you know today is not

245
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,879
necessarily what will be right next week

246
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:10,120
or next month or whatever so the

247
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:13,559
regulatory maze in Europe is amaz is

248
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:16,480
amazing can say it this way okay so

249
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:18,799
again this is the regulatory to make it

250
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,519
even nicer you know that according to

251
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:24,240
the UN regulations if a country want to

252
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,879
legalize or to actually to approve

253
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,079
import or export or or um consumption of

254
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:32,360
cannabis they have to create a local

255
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:34,719
agency each country have to create a

256
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:38,959
local agency to deal with the Cannabis

257
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,200
licensing this is the UN rules so when

258
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,919
you deal with a shipment let's say from

259
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,680
Portugal to Germany so you have to

260
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:49,559
adhere to the

261
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:51,799
Portuguese H inframed rules but you also

262
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:53,919
have to adere to the B Farm

263
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:56,879
rules not the

264
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,559
same and you have to have license import

265
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,799
license from Barm and you have to have

266
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:04,559
export license from inframed or any

267
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:07,359
other agency in the world good luck it

268
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,359
takes time sometimes they delay the

269
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,800
decision you don't understand why

270
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,440
sometimes it will take you a week to get

271
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,078
an input permit sometimes it will take

272
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:18,880
you three weeks to get it and sometimes

273
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:21,958
six weeks to get it h Canada okay just

274
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:24,399
to name few so remember if you want to

275
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:26,638
move even one leave of cannabis you have

276
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,360
to deal with the local a with the not

277
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,799
local well the Country Agency and there

278
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,079
are many of them with different rules

279
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:35,319
with different timelines with different

280
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,679
service

281
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,560
levels sometimes it's even not fun okay

282
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:43,359
but they are setting the rules and we

283
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:46,319
have to understand

284
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,278
that what is cannabis products okay so

285
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,680
we are dealing with a variety of

286
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,679
products let's start with genetics

287
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:56,919
genetics can be seeds can be tissue

288
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:59,958
cultures can be cuttings from a logistic

289
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:02,278
point of view to move cut Cs and we

290
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:05,399
moved already dozens of thousands of

291
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:09,039
cuttings okay cuting right

292
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:11,278
clones so I guess you know that in most

293
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,399
countries in the world they will not

294
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:16,439
accept rooted clothes they will accept

295
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:20,519
just unrooted clothes so when what is an

296
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:23,760
unrooted clone you cut it and if it's

297
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:27,240
not if it will not meet water in 3 4

298
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:29,799
days it's dead there's no roots so all

299
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,759
you have is 3 4 days to to bring it from

300
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:36,000
the cultivation site to somewhere a

301
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:38,639
laboratory or a site that can uh put

302
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,720
them in the water so logistically you

303
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:45,278
have to control from the cutting up to

304
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:48,560
the delivery with a very tight timeline

305
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:51,838
4 days it's dead by the way we have a

306
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:54,198
100% success with that dried flowers

307
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,480
apis what I call apis and you will call

308
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:59,198
extracts completely different logistic

309
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,278
Solutions completely different way to

310
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:04,120
deal with that PE finished semi-finish

311
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:06,480
cannabis products herbal medicine we

312
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,039
heard a lot about it CBD

313
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,720
products do they need temperature

314
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:14,879
control do they need any type kind of

315
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,399
control good questions because some

316
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:19,679
countries will say yes some countries

317
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,320
will say no and smokable products okay

318
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:25,039
same

319
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:28,639
thing so what we really need to know

320
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:31,879
from the quality point of view so

321
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,839
remember medical cannabis is a medicine

322
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:37,240
the problem or the first problem you

323
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,480
have to think about it's a plant based

324
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,680
medicine so it's not the tablet that you

325
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,759
go to the pharmacy and buy it although

326
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:46,559
there are tablets for cannabis but the

327
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:49,199
idea that if you're moving flowers it's

328
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:51,719
a it's a Agricultural Product it's like

329
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:55,078
moving Tomatoes but you don't have

330
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:58,199
medicine Tomatoes This is medicine so

331
00:14:55,078 --> 00:15:01,278
anywhere you go you have to adhere both

332
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:04,120
to the from pharmaceutical side and also

333
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:06,519
to the agricultural side and both

334
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,600
authorities will be involved I'm talking

335
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:13,039
flowers always is a little bit different

336
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,040
so it's a it's a plant-based medicine

337
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:18,958
which require much more attention than

338
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:21,519
just shipping either Pharmaceuticals or

339
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:24,838
tomato second issue of course you have

340
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:28,560
to adhere to the farmer standard quality

341
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:31,040
management GDP you know the whole thing

342
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:35,879
maintain the product

343
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:39,078
Integrity okay safety safe security and

344
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:42,000
of course temperature control okay if

345
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:43,559
you put a Data Logger on the origin and

346
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,318
the guy on the other side have to read

347
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:48,078
it and there is a temperature Excursion

348
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:51,039
no way you can take it to the market

349
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,439
unless you go through certain procedures

350
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,278
so you have to make sure that it's a

351
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,920
medicine you have to make sure how to

352
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,318
maintain the temperature along the

353
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:01,838
supply chain

354
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:04,159
GMP GDP applicable

355
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,160
regulations sometimes it's country

356
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,198
specifics sometimes it's General

357
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,198
sometimes it's country specifics that

358
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:12,958
you have to

359
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:15,838
understand packages I just brought you

360
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:18,119
here a picture of uh of a pette a nice

361
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,440
pette covered with thermal covers It's

362
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,440
Not the Only Solution there are

363
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,319
different solutions how you maintain

364
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,480
temperature okay this pet goes or

365
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:29,759
travels within a temperature control

366
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,800
truck what we call tcv okay temperature

367
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:36,480
control truck with the with um a thermal

368
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:40,078
protection a lot of types of that just

369
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,399
to show you that it has to be packed

370
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:45,879
properly and you have to put the Data

371
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,240
Logger under the the the thermal cover

372
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,799
and not on top of the thermal cover

373
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,159
because you put it on top of the thermal

374
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:53,240
covers you measure the outside

375
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:56,559
temperature you don't measure the inside

376
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:59,639
of the product temperature this is why

377
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:02,078
it's very very important to have a very

378
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,480
strict packaging protocol and to

379
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:05,879
understand how you protect those

380
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,120
products along the supply chain and this

381
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,480
pette can travel 10,000

382
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:12,798
miles okay how you protect it how you

383
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,240
make sure that it's working

384
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:17,679
properly and the last thing it's a good

385
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,199
advice for you when you are selling your

386
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,559
products to a customer on the other side

387
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:25,558
make sure that you understand their

388
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:27,838
acceptance criteria not yours their

389
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:30,480
acceptance criteria whether Laboratory

390
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,399
test whether other tests because you

391
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,480
have to adhere to

392
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,240
their acceptance or rejection criteria

393
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,279
if you don't know it in advance and you

394
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,720
don't bring you know the right covas or

395
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:44,279
the right documents they cannot clear it

396
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,558
in their market so in your Market it

397
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:50,000
might be okay but in their Market it's

398
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:52,399
not going to work this is why make sure

399
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,119
that when you negotiate a deal you

400
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,200
understand those criteria and you make

401
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:59,798
sure that you can adhere to that I saw

402
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,600
too many cases where it was not

403
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:05,119
aligned and it creates a lot of

404
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:06,678
issues so sometimes it's not about the

405
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,239
price it's not about the quality it's

406
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:11,400
not about the size of the of the flowers

407
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,919
or whatever sometimes it's just

408
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,798
laboratory tests heavy metals or

409
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,600
whatever the case

410
00:18:15,798 --> 00:18:20,400
is this is a

411
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:24,879
very uh

412
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,360
schematic chart how we ship cannabis by

413
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,520
the way how we ship Medical Products

414
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,399
anyhow we pick with the temperature

415
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,038
control truck we take it to the airline

416
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,320
we take it to the airport we special

417
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:38,158
measured at the airport we use special

418
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:42,000
special service with the

419
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:44,600
Airlines and on and on and on now you

420
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,440
want to talk about ontime

421
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:49,759
delivery you have to plan it very very

422
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,159
carefully and I'll talk about it a bit

423
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:55,960
later somehow I don't know why a lot of

424
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:58,960
cases in this industry is like you're

425
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:02,679
waiting 5 days before the expiry of the

426
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,640
of the permit and then you [ __ ] why why

427
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:07,200
canot do it months before why to be

428
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,080
under pressure and now you can

429
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,360
understand that sometimes there will be

430
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:13,720
delays there will be issues Customs or

431
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:17,038
whatever and then you are very close to

432
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:20,519
the expiry of your of your license so it

433
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:24,119
takes time and you if you want to meet a

434
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:24,119
deadline you have to plan it

435
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:29,918
carefully

436
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:32,879
security so you see there special

437
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,480
vehicles to maintain security I told you

438
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,240
already that in some cases some

439
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:40,360
countries we are not moving it without a

440
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,519
armed guard whether in the truck or

441
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:45,240
following the

442
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:48,720
truck of course GPS um you know GE

443
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:51,400
fencing all those the solutions but make

444
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,240
sure that you have a good insurance

445
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:57,038
coverage because sometimes things may

446
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:00,839
happen and by the way most of the things

447
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:03,960
we we didn't have even one case of theft

448
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:06,000
most of it is Damages or temperature

449
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,319
Excursion or things like that so make

450
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,519
sure that your insurance cover that we

451
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:13,240
provide special insurance policy for

452
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:15,759
cannabis make sure that you have such

453
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:19,679
it's a little bit more than just regular

454
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:22,759
pharmaceutical but you better have

455
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,320
it operation challenges well I can talk

456
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:27,640
about until the

457
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:31,200
evening so first of

458
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,840
all exportation procedures okay some

459
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,720
countries like for instance Canada you

460
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:38,240
have to be registered as an exporter and

461
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,000
we found cases where we already

462
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,519
collected the the goods and the guy was

463
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,400
not registered as an exported by the way

464
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,158
it's 2 minutes on the computer but you

465
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,120
have to do it once or you have to

466
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:52,200
register yourself with the with the uh

467
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:57,119
um Ministry of Agriculture Authority

468
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:58,840
local sorry I think it's C exactly so

469
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,239
you know exploitation should be be

470
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:03,119
simple but sometimes the procedure are

471
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,759
heavy sometimes they want to examine it

472
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,599
some sometimes they want to test it by

473
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:08,879
the way if it's within the EU it's

474
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:11,639
relatively easy but most of it if it's

475
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:15,360
coming from Canada Australia a lot of

476
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:18,038
issues custom clearance process okay be

477
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,119
aware that in most cases not always

478
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:23,919
customers may open your uh not your

479
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:26,319
boxes but your P to take a look physical

480
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,200
examination which may cause delays

481
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:31,558
usually not damages although we saw that

482
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,558
but you know highly

483
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:37,038
regulated documents and documents and

484
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,960
documents okay it's all about

485
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:42,480
documentation licenses permits feto

486
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,919
sanitary certificates

487
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,839
covas all kinds of declarations if you

488
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:52,320
don't have the right documentation it

489
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:55,399
will be stuck so you better have it and

490
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:58,119
by the way in kabog our practice is

491
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,679
where I'm not picking up even not one

492
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:02,199
flower before we get all the documents

493
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:04,360
and we make sure that we can clear it on

494
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,400
the other side I'm just encourage you to

495
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:09,759
take the same approach because there's

496
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,880
no use to ship it if you cannot clear it

497
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:14,919
so make sure that you can clear it

498
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,840
before even you pick it up and take it

499
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:21,559
to the airport or

500
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:23,879
whatever and other authorities okay it's

501
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:26,038
not just customs in Israel if you want

502
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,760
to clear a cannabis shipment you have to

503
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:31,798
go through three agencies Ministry of

504
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:34,839
Health Ministry of Agriculture and

505
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:37,200
Customs okay Germany is a little bit

506
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:40,319
different Canada is well not import to

507
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,960
Canada but a bit different so anyway

508
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:44,599
other agencies that you have to go

509
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:49,120
through physical examination already

510
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:51,839
spoke about it strict full endtoend

511
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:54,879
control in Pharma and I'm telling I'm

512
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:57,158
saying again it's a medical medical

513
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,159
product so the farma world and the

514
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:02,200
Canabis World require you as a shipper

515
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,840
to make sure that you control the old

516
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,919
chain you cannot say yeah I ship it and

517
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:10,000
that's it it doesn't work this way if

518
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:11,400
you have an audit from the authorities

519
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,919
that you will have to prove that you

520
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,640
know how to control the whole supply

521
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,799
chain there's no stories about that this

522
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,440
is the requirement so you have to make

523
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:23,278
sure that your logistic service

524
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,360
providers trucking companies whatever

525
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:28,519
you can control the whole way

526
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:31,038
through and we are very much

527
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:33,319
recommending on time real time data

528
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:35,119
loggers so you can track the shipment

529
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:36,839
all the way through and if there are

530
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:39,479
delays or if there are issues you can

531
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:39,480
know about it

532
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:46,360
immediately something that we developed

533
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:49,519
in the last year is a very very

534
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:52,278
reliable um Land Transportation within

535
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:54,960
Europe I brought you an example of a

536
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:58,440
shipment going out from Portugal to

537
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:02,278
Germany by temperature control vehicle

538
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:04,080
GDP certified company and you can see

539
00:24:02,278 --> 00:24:06,079
perfect temperature control everything

540
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:08,720
is around 20

541
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:11,399
20° less than 36

542
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,960
hours don't try to see where it came

543
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:18,240
from okay leave it everybody's looking

544
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:20,360
at the map you know to see and H secured

545
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,120
okay you can see few pilots in the truck

546
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:24,558
and those poles are keeping the the

547
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:28,879
freight so it will not fall or move or

548
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:30,440
whatever so limited there not that many

549
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,919
companies can do that so you have to

550
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:36,278
find a very reliable GDP certified

551
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,799
provider Pharma grade

552
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:42,359
service spoke about that online GPS you

553
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:44,359
can see at every point where the truck

554
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:45,519
is and what is the temperature inside

555
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:47,038
the

556
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:49,480
truck

557
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:52,079
reliability reasonable cost

558
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,079
responsiveness if you wish required

559
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,558
documents remember when you move in

560
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:59,119
Europe you cross

561
00:24:55,558 --> 00:25:01,278
borders now if you look at this

562
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,918
example they went from Portugal where

563
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:06,558
it's legal through Spain which is not

564
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,880
legal France which is not legal and then

565
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:12,079
Germany which is legal but you know

566
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,559
crossb within the EU is is possible but

567
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:17,000
you have to have the right H

568
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:19,278
documentation and don't hide it don't

569
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,880
write Pharmaceuticals write cannabis

570
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:23,960
it's okay but as long as you have the

571
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,559
import permit and the export permit and

572
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,278
your documents are good you're good

573
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:30,839
although you've passed those bord ERS

574
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,240
okay but you have to have a very

575
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:35,480
reliable provider that can arrange the

576
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,558
whole thing by the way pre-arranged it's

577
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,839
not that the truck is the living and and

578
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:45,398
you sit down and pray

579
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:48,240
no uh that's what I said

580
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:51,759
pre-arranged air fre so most of the

581
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,038
Cannabis goes by air fre right so first

582
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,798
of all I just want you to know that

583
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:58,319
there are very limited number of

584
00:25:55,798 --> 00:26:00,839
airlines that will carry cannabis not

585
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:03,678
every Airline will carry it just very

586
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:06,879
limited number of Airlines the second

587
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:09,919
thing is high cost sorry to say that the

588
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,399
airlines are taking advantage of our

589
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:17,200
shortage and the cost to ship cannabis

590
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:17,199
is very high much higher than than other

591
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:23,398
things when you come with to an airline

592
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,120
with a cannabis shipment you will always

593
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:28,319
have a delay of 2 three days before they

594
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:30,759
approve it because they have they have

595
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,918
procedure to improve the Cannabis

596
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:36,278
especially when you for instance

597
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:37,799
shipping with u let's say Emirates

598
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:39,599
General I mean those airlines that are

599
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:41,960
going through the gulf so you know the

600
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:44,359
gulf is canist is not legal so they have

601
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,120
to approve it in the origin station they

602
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:48,558
have to approve it in the what we call

603
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:52,079
transip Trans shipment station and then

604
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:54,918
in the destination takes two three days

605
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:57,599
so before we have this uh this we call

606
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:59,600
it okay to forward so before we have

607
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:02,000
this uh confirmation from the airline we

608
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:04,038
cannot move it so remember it's not that

609
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,759
we pick it up and ship it we have to do

610
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:10,759
some arrangements before we can ship it

611
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:13,839
on okay of course direct flights are

612
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:17,558
easier but it Australia right to

613
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:19,639
Australia almost no flights or not

614
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:21,720
direct flights especially not from

615
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:25,399
Canada in Europe very

616
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:28,679
limited so it's an issue tamak time you

617
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:30,599
know that more most of

618
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:36,798
W goes

619
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:38,079
fast so um okay so there's a be aware of

620
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:39,599
two things first of all the trans

621
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:44,879
shipment Point have to be

622
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:47,918
rearranged never ever ever touch a US

623
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:52,919
soil with cannabis shipment they will

624
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:54,759
conf confiscate it don't use American

625
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:57,880
American Airlines I know I I don't mean

626
00:27:54,759 --> 00:28:01,158
the American Airlines company don't even

627
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:03,480
think think about Landing in the US with

628
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:05,760
cannabis shipment with

629
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:09,240
THC okay I just want to go with the

630
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:11,720
lesson learned first of all packages

631
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,200
make sure that your packages first of

632
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,720
all optimal

633
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:20,440
size if you look here in this pallet you

634
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:23,480
see that this shipper paid a lot of

635
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,600
money for for nothing right because the

636
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,720
the boxes are not completely on the

637
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,158
pallet but you're paying for the air as

638
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,839
well

639
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:33,679
by the way something about this uh

640
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:37,480
thermal covers but

641
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:40,840
nonetheless um licenses validity day I

642
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,519
spoke about it avoid weekends try not to

643
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:46,000
Stu on weekends because then you will

644
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:47,880
pay more storage and you cannot clear it

645
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,480
try to do it before the weekend or after

646
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,640
the weekend and original documents

647
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,798
that's my last

648
00:28:52,640 --> 00:29:00,278
one do and doesn't let's hear it let's

649
