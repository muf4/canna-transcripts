This was an excellent event this year,

3
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,960
the culmination of a lot of years

4
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,679
journey and we're moving forward in the

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,200
cannabis industry in Europe full force

6
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,079
through Berlin and onward.

I'm really happy to be here. Jamie

I'm at my favorite conference in

11
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,479
cannabis which is the ICBC. I'm looking

12
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:44,039
forward to ICBC Berlin at the end of

13
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,039
April in 2025.

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,759
One of the things that we got a chance

16
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:56,959
to really connect in about this year was

17
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:59,679
the role that the evolution of cannabis

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,640
science and cannabis genetics will play

19
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:05,359
for the future of the industry. And as

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,359
we move forward, the future is going to

21
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,159
look a little different. So part of what

22
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:13,319
we're doing through these ICBC events is

23
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,719
to cultivate that future to be its most

24
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:19,359
optimized, healthiest, realist and and

25
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:23,079
freest kind of version of the industry

26
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,079
that we can help co-create

27
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:44,399
