14
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:46,710
if it works

15
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:50,159
okay my Spanish teacher told me this in

16
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:52,530
high school cerca de 1984 or whatever

17
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,359
all right so this is a French guy and a

18
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,600
Spanish guy sitting on a park bench

19
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:59,820
right and a young woman walks by and the

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,530
wind blows our skirt up a little bit and

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,659
the French guy who's very philosophical

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,368

23
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:08,069

26
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:17,188
three languages it's good all right

27
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,930
that's cool I'm enjoying Barcelona very

28
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:22,769
much so far I've been here two days and

29
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,509
I've been high for three days so that's

30
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:26,908
pretty good no Barcelona sucks because

31
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,519
here people ask me if I won't we'd

32
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:32,549
rather than if I have weed which is cool

33
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,560
because everywhere else I go people they

34
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,500
always think I'm the guy hey you're Bob

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:42,950

38
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:55,589
Jamie Shaw that was a pretty big intro

39
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:58,559
to live up to especially when ended up

40
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,659
being so long um I want to thank ICBC

41
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,210
first of all for having me here and for

42
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,009
having all of us here I also want to say

43
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:06,779
that I hate introducing myself but not

44
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,689
so much that I won't make my panelists

45
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,848
do it so as you come out if you want to

46
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:15,000
say a few words about yourself in your

47
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:16,500
work we'll start off with David I think

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,739
all the mics you're on the chairs come

49
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,930
on okay so this is the panel on social

50
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,610
cannabis clubs will be talking obviously

51
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,629
about social cannabis clubs but we'll

52
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,209
also be talking a little bit about

53
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:29,250
dispensaries retail models in different

54
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:32,400
places in the world probably mostly

55
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,469
California in Canada as comparisons so

56
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,739
David yeah from each cue like introduce

57
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:39,560
yourself hey how are you hey yeah my

58
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:44,430
name is David there's Natalie and I'm a

59
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:48,479
president for older and creator of HQ HQ

60
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:51,450
Barcelona yeah this is I represent here

61
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:55,469
social cannabis clubs but by themselves

62
00:02:51,449 --> 00:03:00,479
and this is the model that I defend HQ

63
00:02:55,469 --> 00:03:06,539
is a close-knit community of members but

64
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:09,238
beside it's my my home my family so the

65
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:12,060
thing is like it's it's kind of

66
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:17,039
different from the other two world war

67
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:19,590
world-known models like coffee shops in

68
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:22,979
Netherlands where walk-ins are accepted

69
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:26,519
or like dispensaries in United States

70
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:29,009
we're also walking Sur accepted in in HQ

71
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,319
you can't walk in you know so the other

72
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:34,259
member has to represent and sign for you

73
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:38,189
and yeah it's a big community for sure

74
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:41,729
but finally it's a family it's very

75
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:44,818
important for us we work with them we we

76
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:47,459
are active members you know we want to

77
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:49,348
break the stereotype of typical guy who

78
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,840
smokes oh he doesn't want to do anything

79
00:03:49,348 --> 00:03:55,619
we did a lot of activities it's a sport

80
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,560
its its music concerts we play

81
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,710
basketball

82
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:04,009
we make concerts we make some art events

83
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:07,939
it's it's a lot of things we do every

84
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:12,019
day yeah so I don't know I'm happy to be

85
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:14,270
here and represent our European model if

86
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,850
you have any questions in here over here

87
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:21,199
we definitely do thank you David next up

88
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:23,330
is dr. Dina hello I am dr. Dina I am NOT

89
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,319
a real doctor I'm board-certified by

90
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:28,759
Snoop Dogg I started the very first

91
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:31,969
dispensary in Southern California we

92
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:33,980
have the oldest in operation dispensary

93
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,770
in the United States which is pretty

94
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,540
amazing but I first started in the

95
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:41,269
medical side I opened up the very first

96
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,370
doctor's office that specialized in

97
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:45,859
medical cannabis recommendations and

98
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,449
then we had to find a place to where we

99
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,449
could send our patients to pick up their

100
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:52,579
medicine because everyone would ask once

101
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:54,860
they got their letter of recommendation

102
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:57,649
they were now legal where do we get our

103
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,900
cannabis so we opened up a dispensary in

104
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:01,668
the City of West Hollywood we worked

105
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:04,939
very closely with the city to create

106
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:07,819
regulations to allow people to have safe

107
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:10,100
access the reason why we started in the

108
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:12,620
City of West Hollywood is because there

109
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:16,100
are more people living in that city with

110
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:19,340
HIV and AIDS similar to a San Francisco

111
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:22,310
than most major cities and because of

112
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:24,469
that we were able to push the medical

113
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:27,560
side of it as you know cannabis is

114
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:29,419
extremely popular for people with HIV

115
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:33,139
and AIDS we know that it helps with

116
00:05:29,418 --> 00:05:35,870
wasting syndrome with pain with nausea

117
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:38,509
all these other you know side effects

118
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,009
from medications so because of that we

119
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:42,500
were able to get the voice of the

120
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:44,418
community and from there you could open

121
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,790
up the door to people with cancer people

122
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:49,279
with MS people with aches and pains

123
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:52,129
people with migraines people with stress

124
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:55,909
and before you know it that really means

125
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:58,699
to me all use is medical use we have now

126
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:01,540
convinced California to loosen its

127
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:05,269
regulations in a way where we now have

128
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:08,479
adult use cannabis so anyone 21 and over

129
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:09,909
can walk into my dispensary show their

130
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,370
drivers license or

131
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:14,230
sport from anywhere in the world and

132
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,600
they can procure cannabis they can

133
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:18,520
purchase it it is taxed it is like

134
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,129
buying a pair of shoes in a department

135
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:23,469
store except department stores aren't

136
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:27,670
regulated we are more regulated than

137
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:29,680
alcohol than pharmacies it's really

138
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,509
unbelievable what we've created when I

139
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,959
first started the dispensary I didn't

140
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:36,789
see the future really of where we'd be

141
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,849
now but now we're now we're a huge

142
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:42,600
industry and I have licenses for

143
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:46,120
cultivation for manufacturing for

144
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,670
distribution for delivery and retail so

145
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,220
I really have seen the full spectrum but

146
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:53,530
the most exciting part is now the social

147
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:56,260
clubs which we are just starting to open

148
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:58,319
now in California and I think it's going

149
00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:00,879
to really change the way that people see

150
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,560
medicating or using cannabis because

151
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,889
we're gonna have a safe place to go do

152
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,329
it

153
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:07,930
similar to what they've built in

154
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:10,810
Amsterdam and now Spain thank you so

en este a Panera said good morning

193
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,659
no Bernardo as a lawyer he does a lot of

194
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:26,859
advocacy work a lot of activism work he

195
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:29,110
works with a lot of clubs

196
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,720
if you're from Canada similar to Kurt -

197
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:35,289
Sarge on Conroy in the state so to me be

198
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,550
Dennis Peron mmm filled that role and he

199
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:39,039
was talking about how the social clubs

200
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:41,069
are not actually legal and it's not so

201
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,809
much even a gray area that it used to be

202
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:45,460
and we'll kind of get more into that how

203
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:50,109
that legislation changed and everything

204
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:52,389
else so in every everywhere that

205
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:54,700
cannabis is legal or soon to be legal or

206
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:57,580
has the possibility of becoming legal it

207
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:59,379
started as a grassroots movement and in

208
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,910
every area it started actually fairly

209
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:02,649
similar when you look at the early

210
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:05,379
dispensaries in the bay or here West

211
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:09,189
Hollywood or Canada they tended to be

212
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:10,899
collector collectives row ops it was

213
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,670
people who were growing and we're

214
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:13,629
sharing with other growers we're sharing

215
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:16,419
for patients who were growing

216
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:18,700
specifically for patients it was a lot

217
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:21,069
more like the social club model then

218
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,259
what it looks like now in California or

219
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,509
Canada and then of course there's also

220
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:28,789
other models too such as

221
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:30,740
Amsterdam's coffee shop model Bernardo

222
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:34,808
can you explain exactly what the social

223
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:38,329
club model is here in Spain M

de or oppose como en cambio de las cosas

247
00:11:55,129 --> 00:12:05,600
an evil man yeah so kind of recap a

248
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:07,548
little bit at the social club model

249
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,069
again like I said earlier is very much

250
00:12:07,548 --> 00:12:11,869
more like a collective um it's not so

251
00:12:10,068 --> 00:12:13,909
much a corporation and that member so

252
00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:15,459
usually referred by other members so

253
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:18,409
it's not kind of open to the public

254
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:19,998
earlier earliest dispensaries again in

255
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:21,528
North America we're very similar but it

256
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:22,999
wasn't so much being referred by other

257
00:12:21,528 --> 00:12:24,948
members it was having some sort of

258
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:27,528
medical documentation which was

259
00:12:24,948 --> 00:12:29,328
difficult to get dr. dena you like me

260
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:32,298
have experience in those very very early

261
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:34,338
dispensary days where is California at

262
00:12:32,298 --> 00:12:37,039
right now compared to where Spain's at

263
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:39,230
or work at it as that California's a

264
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,209
whole nother beast now I mean

265
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:44,389
ever since legalization hit it's it's

266
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:45,830
both exciting and and sad because there

267
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:48,500
are so many people who built the

268
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:50,480
industry to where we are right now who

269
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,879
were pushed out they were not able to

270
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,190
get licenses and those to me are some of

271
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:56,750
the most talented people you want on

272
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,870
your side you want those people on your

273
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:01,789
team you want them growing your cannabis

274
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,500
unfortunately for us they might be

275
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:05,659
moving to Spain to grow the cannabis

276
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,610
here because there's just not that much

277
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:09,919
that much opportunity there's only so

278
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,990
many licenses that are being given out

279
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,389
there's a lot of big corporations coming

280
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:16,190
in pushing out the small people and

281
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:19,519
that's what's really happening right now

282
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:23,240
yes it's exciting that we're seeing has

283
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:25,159
a legitimate business although we still

284
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,310
have the federal government looming over

285
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:30,980
our head saying sorry guys it's not

286
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:33,049
federally legal it's still a Schedule

287
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:36,170
one drug it's not going to happen but

288
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:38,599
that means I can't bank and so I can't

289
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:41,029
have a bank account under my dispensary

290
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,620
name they shut me down all the time you

291
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:45,289
can pop up with a different management

292
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,820
company they're gonna find you and so

293
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:49,069
that's the biggest issue right now it's

294
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,450
it's the money it's the banking it's how

295
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,400
do you pay your bills how do you pay

296
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:55,220
your employees the state's requiring

297
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,980
that we do payroll in a certain you know

298
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,389
amount of time how do you pay a payroll

299
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,519
company when you don't have a bank

300
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:03,649
account so you have to find a payroll

301
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,049
company from that's popping up in the

302
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:08,929
cannabis industry that someone who was a

303
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:11,709
grower maybe could not get a license but

304
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:14,359
now they're starting a cat all-cash

305
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:15,710
payroll company they'll come and bring

306
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,570
up you know pick up the cash from your

307
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:19,400
dispensary and they'll pay the payroll

308
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:22,879
so we're figuring it out we're self

309
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:26,870
regulating as an industry it's exciting

310
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:30,590
times for me I think that by having the

311
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:32,330
social club license the lounge and and

312
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:35,180
we're in the process of opening up a

313
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:38,629
restaurant and lounge it right now

314
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:40,459
it's it's open it's advertised I can go

315
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:44,350
to Yelp and I can search for it it's

316
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:47,150
there that changes the way that people

317
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,860
can medicate here it's like I had to do

318
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:50,959
a lot of homework to find your place and

319
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,669
I had to send messages to people and I

320
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,950
had to get recommending it it made it

321
00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:57,289
really exciting when I walked in I felt

322
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:59,330
like I earned it you know and I visited

323
00:14:57,289 --> 00:15:01,519
David's amazing shop last night his

324
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:03,860
lounge last night and it's a beautiful

325
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,360
place and it's just a nice place to the

326
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,810
community that's what it's about it's

327
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,190
about building community amongst

328
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:12,500
cannabis users because we're really

329
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:14,390

00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:18,769
to get inside the HQ I know a lot of

332
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:21,259
people a lot of people that don't mean a

333
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:22,970
David how it's always possible I was

334
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:25,460
there like I was there I couldn't get it

335
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,560
just right now half an hour ago like one

336
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:29,540
guy like David we met yesterday I'm like

337
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:31,339
yeah we're in the front of the shop I'm

338
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:34,759
like yeah so what's up you like I

339
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:37,490
couldn't get in oh I'm sorry it's it's

340
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:39,350
it's difficult we make it we know we're

341
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,570
not making it difficult it's not like

342
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:45,560
usually you have to be sign that by the

343
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:47,840
other it's all the time 100% imagine the

344
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:50,119
difference though on January 1st of this

345
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:53,060
last year when we became legal I showed

346
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,940
up to work and there was a line that was

347
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:57,709
over a mile and a half long of people

348
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,190
waiting and I'm going what are they

349
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,200
waiting for

350
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,210
I mean this is crazy and this is some of

351
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,460
the irony's equalization so what we've

352
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:05,780
seen in California and the microcosm is

353
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,730
is you've got cities like San Francisco

354
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:09,289
and Berkeley and Oakland that had really

355
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,310
great sort of community oriented

356
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:12,799
initiatives

357
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:14,389
you know subsidized medicine things like

358
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,889
that and then once the state legalized

359
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:17,509
sort of steamroll with a lot of that

360
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:19,129
stuff and kind of pushed it down it's

361
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:20,840
funny you said that because I was in my

362
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:22,580
shop the other day and I was talking and

363
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,980
there was a homeless man that came in

364
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,600
and I could see he was struggling and

365
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,120
trying to look for some change in his

366
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,590
pocket and normally in the past I would

367
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,810
see someone like that I would go into

368
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:34,100
the back and I would grab a joint and I

369
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:36,019
would give it to him and say there you

370
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,899
go because that's what we're here for

371
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:41,289
as a community now I can't do that I

372
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:43,939
cannot do it unless this man pays taxes

373
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:46,309
yeah and I think you know if you ever

374
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,230
federally I mean I was in a different

375
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:49,939
club yesterday and it was kind of hard

376
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,159
to talk about you know legalization

377
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:55,010
because they really want it to be legal

378
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,929
and I was like well do you cuz right

379
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:57,840
here how are your wishes already good I

380
00:16:56,929 --> 00:16:59,519
mean that's exact

381
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,460
what it comes down to but but you know

382
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,889
what for me the legitimacy I've been

383
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,740
I've had a dispensary for 17 years I

384
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:10,560
could walk into different social circles

385
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:12,690
throughout my life right and tell people

386
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:16,139
what I do for a living and for the last

387
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:18,690
17 years it was like ooh oh your drug

388
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,940
dealer or oh oh you're in the gray zone

389
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:21,420
you know oh I don't I can't be friends

390
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,120
with you

391
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,870
you know you might go to jail Oh

392
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,789
everybody wants to be my friend

393
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:28,799
everybody wants to know how its business

394
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:31,250
you need an investor everybody's proud

395
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,720
of me I've had transforming people

396
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:36,059
conservative Republicans

397
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,180
it's our taking cannabis I had

398
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:40,710
Republican congressman come to me for

399
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,430
cannabis products because they have a

400
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,559
bad shoulder

401
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:45,870
it was just cream but they wouldn't use

402
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:48,089
it before and now it's okay so the

403
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:50,009
stigma is gone and I believe that that

404
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:52,230
stigma is going to help the rest of the

405
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:54,509
world once that stigma leaves everybody

406
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,339
else in a see this was not a big deal

407
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:58,859
nothing's happening there are no car

408
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:00,839
accidents in California more than there

409
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:03,269
were before in fact there's less there

410
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:05,240
are less kids using cannabis because

411
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:08,129
it's just not cool anymore it's like

412
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,750
it's easy to get it big deal yeah that's

413
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,360
what's up that's what we hope you're

414
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:15,869
having here right yeah exactly exactly

415
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:19,979
we we are equipped to provide cannabis

416
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:21,389
to all users so there is no more case of

417
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,730
you don't have to you don't have you

418
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,980
don't you there is no need to go to the

419
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,660
street and find a dealer so it's like

420
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,549
it's more closed and hopefully when you

421
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,290
go to a dealer it's regular cannabis

422
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:33,329
it's not regular like if you're on

423
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:35,220
somebody's if you have a child and you

424
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:37,230
know that kid is gonna go buy weed right

425
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,539
would you rather go to a social club and

426
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:41,370
pick it up there as opposed to go to a

427
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:43,289
drug dealer who might offer them and say

428
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:45,569
hey I'm low on weed but I have some

429
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:47,369
ecstasy and some pills I don't really

430
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:49,619
quite know what's in there but take

431
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:50,849
those I've had too many friends overdose

432
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:53,309
over the years because they didn't have

433
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:54,629
access to cannabis in Vancouver what

434
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:57,599
we've seen in this is even before

435
00:18:54,630 --> 00:19:00,090
legalization is as dispensaries as the

436
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:03,419
number of dispensaries grew the youth

437
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:05,789
use rate dropped the age of first use

438
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,800
dropped by a whole year within the space

439
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:09,809
of about five years I'm trying to get

440
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:10,200
cannabis in the high school didn't work

441
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:11,759
I mean

442
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,269
I smoked my first joint in the girls

443
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,798
washroom and I think grade 8 that was

444
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:18,929
the first time I was exposed to cannabis

445
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,179
and I don't think schools really see

446
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:22,679
that now well it has a dare program and

447
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:25,080
I think that's what a lot of hits first

448
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,359
introduction to cannabis is is you know

449
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:29,460
your brain on drugs is the egg cracking

450
00:19:27,358 --> 00:19:31,678
in the pan and you're gonna be toasted

451
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:36,778
you can't pass the SATs which is all a

452
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:38,309
lie obviously but my nephew is 13 I had

453
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:40,558
to not I never told him what I did for a

454
00:19:38,308 --> 00:19:42,538
living I was terrified this kid's gonna

455
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,028
find me on instagram and see my profile

456
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:47,548
and like oh god he's old enough right so

457
00:19:45,028 --> 00:19:49,950
he sat him down and I said listen and

458
00:19:47,548 --> 00:19:52,858
I've really I was so terrified to tell

459
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:54,450
him I felt like I was telling like as a

460
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,980
15 year old telling my parents I was

461
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:59,038
pregnant or something it was like this

462
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:01,440
horrible by the way you know I'm in the

463
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:04,888
middle marijuana industry he goes oh

464
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,869
okay that's for sick people yeah it was

465
00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:08,459
like whatever what why is that important

466
00:20:06,868 --> 00:20:11,009
why do you care why are you nervous

467
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,509
and those attitudes changed so fast so

468
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,308
fast like I think people would be

469
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:16,649
surprised and that's the future those

470
00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:20,908
kids you know we continue I have a

471
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:23,819
nephew he's 13 he came like coming every

472
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:26,639
year to Spain to visit me so last time

473
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:29,428
he was like hey you know what uncle you

474
00:20:26,638 --> 00:20:31,918
gave me this shirt I saw 420 on it

475
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:34,649
what's that I'm like you know it's a

476
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,889
number of the building I had the

477
00:20:34,648 --> 00:20:40,408
opposite like yeah sure okay so you know

478
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:42,089
they know it's okay it's okay

479
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:44,159
but yeah I know what you mean because

480
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:45,749
like last time we we moved to another

481
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,940
apartment with my wife it was like

482
00:20:45,749 --> 00:20:51,329
alright we're assigning the pre-contract

483
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:54,269
it was good in in two days the agents

484
00:20:51,329 --> 00:20:56,220
calling like that it's not possible Matt

485
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:58,259
why because they just looked up your

486
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,739
name in Google I'm like what's up there

487
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:03,899
dude put your name in Google and yeah so

488
00:21:01,739 --> 00:21:06,659
but you know what happened the the

489
00:21:03,898 --> 00:21:08,969
director of the agency called owners and

490
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:11,850
they talked and we came in and there was

491
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:14,700
like 90 years old like serious Borgias

492
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:16,888
people here they were who they we

493
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,109
explained they saw me they you know it's

494
00:21:16,888 --> 00:21:21,959
changing it's very slowly but it's our

495
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:22,970
generation so our absolutely for us by

496
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,400
what we do

497
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,110
they appreciate entrepreneurism likely

498
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,900
they appreciate that you can go out and

499
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:31,609
build a business it's like the younger

500
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,250
ones I feel like it was like the 60 year

501
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:35,059
olds I had a hard time convincing

502
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,970
exactly exactly

503
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:39,980
I'm done one time we went to see their

504
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:42,200
bill with a building before the HQ you

505
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:45,440
know we opened HQ and that women she was

506
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:48,140
like what weeds no no this is not for

507
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,779
our family I'm like what women would

508
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:53,480
wear to have a bar open my bar so we

509
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:55,339
want to open the bar so anytime you open

510
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,620
a bar you know that there are some you

511
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:59,539
know consciousness it was cold

512
00:21:57,619 --> 00:22:02,089
there is like I don't know like legal

513
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:05,450
alcohol there is like kids entering what

514
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:08,419
walking in so you you're accepting this

515
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:10,549
but you're not accepting with right I

516
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:13,730
saw I was in I almost got kicked out at

517
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:15,559
Bergheim last year club in Berlin and it

518
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,329
was it was because of that I was smoking

519
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:18,889
a joint and and you know there's people

520
00:22:17,329 --> 00:22:20,619
going in and out of the bathroom I'm

521
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:22,850
like all night long every ten minutes

522
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:24,619
and you know they came up to me was like

523
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:26,209
smoking that [ __ ] tunes if [ __ ] in it

524
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:30,500
and I thought they meant tobacco I was

525
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:31,670
like no I don't you know my German

526
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,319
friend was like no no no that's what

527
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:35,779
they call cannabis [ __ ] and I was like

528
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:37,250
oh that's a weird stigma to kind of

529
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:39,470
still have to try and deal with I'm kind

530
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,789
of coming back to the models I was

531
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:43,640
wondering dataview talked a little bit

532
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:45,680
about the coffee shop model in Amsterdam

533
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,390
for example and how how certain

534
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,920
unregulated grey markets there's certain

535
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,720
benefits to it and then there's also

536
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,100
some drawbacks such as you know you

537
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,049
still have the threat of having your

538
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:54,709
kids taken away from you or things like

539
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:57,259
that

540
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:59,299
I think my favorite part of regulation

541
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:00,950
is the lab tests and to be perfectly

542
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:04,849
honest just knowing that what we're

543
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:08,690
getting is clean it's safe medicine you

544
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:11,119
have up when I first the legalization

545
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:13,910
first hit and I've tried to look into my

546
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:15,469
little you know crystal ball to predict

547
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:17,930
the future as to what would happen the

548
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:20,390
next day was December 31st I was

549
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:24,140
terrified I didn't know if I was just

550
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:27,440
gonna have miles of 21-year old standing

551
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:28,970
in line buying the cannabis and there

552
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,080
were small amounts because not many

553
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:32,630
people had been like

554
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:35,389
just yet and my concern was will I have

555
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:36,860
enough cannabis for the medical patients

556
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,720
because we still take the medical

557
00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:41,058
there's the adult use side and there's a

558
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,720
medical medical patients can buy as much

559
00:23:41,058 --> 00:23:43,849
as they want

560
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,278
there's no limit they don't pay sales

561
00:23:43,849 --> 00:23:48,980
tax if you have a medical card they

562
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:51,980
still pay a 15 percent excise tax but

563
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,690
it's lab tested and to me that is the

564
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,009
most exciting part because you know

565
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,929
there's gonna be molds there's the

566
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:58,519
pesticide so a minefield though so what

567
00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:01,278
we're running through in Canada is

568
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:03,048
overly restrictive so if you grow in

569
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:04,398
live soil for example there's no way you

570
00:24:03,048 --> 00:24:06,408
will ever pass back and it doesn't

571
00:24:04,398 --> 00:24:08,298
matter if it's clean or not that's the

572
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:10,490
way they set their regulations I have a

573
00:24:08,298 --> 00:24:11,720
friend who failed their pesticides are

574
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,089
there they had ecoli

575
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,778
in their cannabis it was from their

576
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:17,720
earthworms

577
00:24:14,778 --> 00:24:20,419
Anana organic grow so yes there could

578
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,950
always be bumps in the road if we will

579
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:23,720
happen it's gonna beat this me a

580
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,580
learning curve to figuring this out but

581
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,460
there's a lot of clean product on the

582
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:30,379
market that part is great what I notice

583
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:32,840
that when instead of the 21 year old

584
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,730
showing up it was it was a 60 year olds

585
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:37,189
it was all these people who were afraid

586
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:39,558
to get their doctor's note who said you

587
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:41,538
know I've got a bad shoulder or I can't

588
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:43,730
sleep at night and I'd like this the

589
00:24:41,538 --> 00:24:47,298
vape pen market went through the roof

590
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:49,788
overnight a really incredible market I

591
00:24:47,298 --> 00:24:52,069
would probably went from 15 percent of

592
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:54,379
our sales to 60 percent of our sales

593
00:24:52,069 --> 00:24:57,980
which is tremendous I want but with the

594
00:24:54,380 --> 00:25:00,559
lab testing you have phase 3 which just

595
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:02,929
hit which is heavy metals and a lot of

596
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:04,490
companies using cheap cartridges are

597
00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:07,399
noticing that the metal inside the

598
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:12,138
cartridge is leeching into the oil these

599
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:15,319
the silicone ring is turning into

600
00:25:12,138 --> 00:25:17,298
ammonia so there if it's not all perfect

601
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:20,178
but we have to make sure we're using a

602
00:25:17,298 --> 00:25:23,269
good high quality product pen surgical

603
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:25,340
steel that's good for the safe the end

604
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:26,929
user for sure yeah I wanna come back to

605

00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:01,529
all five those properly but a personal

662
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,299
growing is is a big goal access to

663
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:05,490
medical cannabis access to education and

664
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:07,169
of course get in business getting the

665
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:09,660
business world involved which is where

666
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:11,970
things start to kind of go funny you

667
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:13,290
know we've got the same thing in Canada

668
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,970
where you know all of the black market

669
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:18,059
players all the people that got us here

670
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:19,890
sort of got pushed aside and I mean in

671
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:21,419
fact who's a shameless plug but Hacha

672
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,759
brands what are the groups that I've

673
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:25,470
working with now is is built around that

674
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:27,119
it's literally designed to get these

675
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:31,039
black market players licensed and

676
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:33,539
legalized and regulated in that model so

677
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,159
the other thing that Bernardo mentioned

678
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:36,990
was that that you know the the cannabis

679
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,390
social clubs that they contribute to

680
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:42,000
overall economic activity but there's no

681
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:43,230
direct taxation that goes through and

682
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,269
that they're not really companies

683
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,519
they're run more like families or

684
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:50,129
collectives as we spoke about earlier so

685
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,049
David what's the process is like if I

686
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:55,110
wanted to set up a social club here

687
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:57,029
tomorrow how would I do that besides

688
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:58,709
calling Bernardo nothing sure I have a

689
00:28:57,029 --> 00:29:02,789
good lawyer yeah that was my first and

690
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:06,029
vehicle Bernardo first of all there is a

691
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:08,849
there is a complicated process of

692
00:29:06,029 --> 00:29:12,210
getting all the paperwork done there's

693
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:14,809
specialized companies that can help you

694
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:18,150
here in that what kind of paperwork

695
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:20,369
I don't know what's the name in in

696
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:22,410
English but esta to dos you know it's

697
00:29:20,369 --> 00:29:24,839
like the the rules that your

698
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:29,009
organization's gonna be gonna buy yeah

699
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:31,589
so I'm not sure if they're still giving

700
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:33,930
the licenses I know that in some regions

701
00:29:31,589 --> 00:29:36,959
of Spain they not giving it at all here

702
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:39,630
in Barcelona we had like in two years of

703
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,450
the they closed it then they open it

704
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:48,000
again it's it's difficult it's very

705
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:49,950
difficult the thing is also is when you

706
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,099
when you want to open a social club you

707
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:55,890
have to understand that the cultivation

708
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:58,619
well the transport is illegal

709
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:59,910
here it's been absolutely no gray area

710
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:04,469
it's just illegal

711
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:07,110
so yeah let's say in Netherlands for

712
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,970
example they you know that they can sell

713
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:11,579
weed but they can't grow with I mean

714
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:14,850
like it's what it's a loophole it's a

715
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:16,859
big loophole here the same but the club

716
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:19,139
that all this social club system is

717
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:22,319
working still just because one thing is

718
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:24,930
the constitutional right here in Spain -

719
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:28,460
if you are adult and you're more than 18

720
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:32,400
years old so you can consume your

721
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:34,529
cannabis privately so if I can do it

722
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,509
myself at home and you can do it

723
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:39,119
yourself at your home what's up if we

724
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:41,339
want to do it together and what's up if

725
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:44,369
we all want to do it together so we

726
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:48,240
gather yeah and we maybe we make a

727
00:30:44,369 --> 00:30:51,899
collective grow up yeah and we just rent

728
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:54,480
a place yes and we set sets rules to be

729
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:57,450
alive that's it so that's how it start

730
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,910
everyone that want to get in it has to

731
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:03,059
be represented by the other member and

732
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:07,170
there is no other way of getting in this

733
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:09,450
is very very strict thing and I don't I

734
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:12,330
don't know if if a lot of people

735
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:14,309
understand that the no walk-ins is very

736
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:16,259
important in social cannabis club system

737
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:17,700
it sounds very similar to the way that

738
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:19,650
they deal with alcohol in places like

739
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:22,170
Salt Lake City Utah for example when

740
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:24,330
they've got the private clubs by the way

741
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:27,779
yeah because you know when you said

742
00:31:24,329 --> 00:31:30,599
about you mentioned that right now in

743
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:33,029
California you are like there are places

744
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:35,699
I know that you are trying to open the

745
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:38,819
place the restaurant with it lounge but

746
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:40,740
I was there like heyou months ago I

747
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:43,139
found just one place in whole San

748
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:45,059
Francisco where there was lounge is it

749
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,770
changing I mean like yes so people's to

750
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:48,539
get the license de la well we used to

751
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:49,710
just be able to smoke in this dispensary

752
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:52,109
in San Francisco

753
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:53,970
Oh for years we had a front room and

754
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:55,679
that was just go and buy and you sit

755
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:58,289
down you smoke it was our mall but there

756
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,420
was no food or drinks or it wasn't like

757
00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:02,009
we don't want you to hang out all day it

758
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,800
was just smoke your joint go because we

759
00:32:02,009 --> 00:32:06,849
have only

760
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:09,309
couch right we need rotating couch so

761
00:32:06,849 --> 00:32:12,129
yeah but other than that it's very very

762
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:13,659
different now the licensing started they

763
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,910
hadn't they haven't given them out yet

764
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:18,279
so they've just in the last month or so

765
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:21,340
have started giving out these licenses

766
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:23,829
so give it about three three months or

767
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:25,269
so and they'll be open we've gone

768
00:32:23,829 --> 00:32:27,189
through something similar in Canada

769
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:28,809
where are the early dispensaries had all

770
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:31,090
smoke rooms in the back which brought a

771
00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:32,500
whole host of new problems that deal

772
00:32:31,089 --> 00:32:35,980
with let's see this interesting is in

773
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:38,349
California similar to Spain you go into

774
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:40,390
a lounge and you procure your cannabis

775
00:32:38,349 --> 00:32:43,000
there and you smoke it on-site and you

776
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:45,370
don't leave with it but with a challenge

777
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,440
for us is that in order to get into the

778
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:50,769
lounge you have to walk in to a

779
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,690
dispensary first if you have to go into

780
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:55,119
the dispensary and then a door into the

781
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:59,080
lounge so it's all combined into one

782
00:32:55,119 --> 00:33:00,759
type of business which is I mean it's

783
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:02,169
it's an evolution that I think we're

784
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:04,779
gonna need to get to but how do I

785
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:06,880
determine if you buy if you walk in the

786
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:09,009
dispensary my purchase product and then

787
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,720
you go into the lounge and then do you

788
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:12,490
can you consume that you have to buy it

789
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,809
separately and then can you walk out

790
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:16,809
with your bag I mean these are all

791
00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:18,339
problems that we have to deal with which

792
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:19,990
are which are better problems than what

793
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:21,819
we have in Canada right now because what

794
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:23,799
we've done is well similar to very early

795
00:33:21,819 --> 00:33:25,119
medical systems in the States where they

796
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:26,769
were like okay you're allowed to have

797
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:28,419
medical cannabis but you couldn't grow

798
00:33:26,769 --> 00:33:28,960
it yourself you couldn't buy it from

799
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,550
anybody

800
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,319
nobody could sell it to you but you were

801
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:34,180
allowed to have it right and we're sort

802
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:36,639
of like that now in Canada where we've

803
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:38,470
legalized last October and there are

804
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,920
still some lounges around but they are

805
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:44,319
illegal still and because they've sort

806
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:47,259
of looped things into a tobacco smoke

807
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:48,789
clause you can't smoke inside so that's

808
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:50,410
where we're at right now is where we've

809
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:52,450
got illegal lounges that we're losing

810
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:54,850
and dispensaries that used to have

811
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:57,400
lounges have pushed them out and so

812
00:33:54,849 --> 00:34:02,250
Bernardo how how would you suggest Spain

813
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:06,810
handles consumption lounges or or spaces

814
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:10,360
en en españa en propio esposa de

consumption right now actually the only

841
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:31,539
thing that is legal in Spain but there

842
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:33,429
are problems with the sale and

843
00:35:31,539 --> 00:35:35,590
distribution but also possession and

844
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:37,239
that was when I ordered cannabis

845
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:38,980
yesterday at the club that was she kind

846
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:41,199

847
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:44,469
how much I want it you know you can get

848

really big fines for this but I mean

849
00:35:44,469 --> 00:35:48,219
again this is something that sort of

850
00:35:45,789 --> 00:35:51,400
changes as we go along and and do you

851

que es algo que como de Oeste salvo la

875
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:08,260
revolucion Espanola so so Fernando

876
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:10,409
doesn't feel that that the social club

877
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:14,950
model is necessarily going to change

878
00:37:10,409 --> 00:37:17,649
it's it's because the public lounge is

879
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:19,359
not very likely due to the same issues

880
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:21,519
that that California is running into the

881
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,470
sea music California does running into

882
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:25,360
in terms of acquainting it cannabis I

883
00:37:23,469 --> 00:37:26,589
think we're getting pretty close to the

884
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,800
end of our time so I want to actually

885
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:32,320
ask each of you one more question and

886
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,990
we'll start with David what would be

887
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:38,920
your perfect advice or house Maine

888
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:42,189
should legalize cannabis there is no

889
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:45,159
perfect advice I am optimistic in that I

890
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:48,070
we are really years behind of

891
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:50,619
legalization right now but let's say my

892
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:55,420
prognosis is like five years maybe right

893
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:57,250
now we have to understand that it is

894
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:59,230
very important to analyze all our

895
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:03,460
products and to be clear with our

896
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:05,980
members and try to push the platforms

897
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:10,570
such as rosa verde or regulation

898
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:13,929
responsibly and try to make them support

899
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:16,030
what we do why because as you said maybe

900
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:18,669
it's not cool to be legal for us right

901
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:20,620
now yes because we we don't want to be

902
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:23,079
neither black neither

903
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:26,230
gray side we want to be white and yeah

904
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:29,380
we can't pay taxes but you know what in

905
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:32,860
HQ we paying all our salaries to all our

906
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:34,640
workers by bank we've made taxes from

907
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:37,608
that we pay taxes from all the

908
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:39,379
the non-weight product on site also we

909
00:38:37,608 --> 00:38:43,098
want to be very clear with all the ads

910
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:44,869
right so this is how we operate I don't

911
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:46,970
know if someday someone gonna come to my

912
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:49,369
door not gonna say hey your rest I'm

913
00:38:46,969 --> 00:38:51,879
like why it was I hold it just to make

914
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:53,960
people happy that says I don't know

915
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:57,858
something like that thank you thank you

916
00:38:53,960 --> 00:39:00,740
I have one question is a puzzle I have

917
00:38:57,858 --> 00:39:02,028
just one question for you because the

918
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:04,308
thing is like you're opening a

919
00:39:02,028 --> 00:39:06,409
restaurant and a lounge together is

920
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:08,690
interesting why because for example in

921
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:10,429
social clubs we can't have a kitchen you

922
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:12,980
know why because we're making like

923
00:39:10,429 --> 00:39:15,440
illegal competence to restaurants and

924
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:18,469
they can claim us you know because you

925
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,450
can't smoke inside the restaurant so if

926
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:21,858
we have a kitchen inside the club so

927
00:39:20,449 --> 00:39:23,989
it's illegal you know like because

928
00:39:21,858 --> 00:39:26,179
people can't smoke itself what do you

929
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:28,969
think about that you know it gets very

930
00:39:26,179 --> 00:39:31,098
complicated and and when you start

931
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:33,618
creating regulations for a social club

932
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:36,730
you're sort of separated from a real

933
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:39,079
restaurant you can serve food it's it's

934
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:41,210
yeah that's definitely a wall there's a

935
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:44,150
separation but it's it's a place where

936
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:47,059
we can serve so and the food is not

937
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:49,849
medicated food but if you order french

938
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:52,759
fries we can sell you a packet of

939
00:39:49,849 --> 00:39:54,980
medicated ketchup that you can then use

940
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:56,869
so it's it's that's how we get around it

941
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:59,150
so what we've really got something

942
00:39:56,869 --> 00:40:02,900
similar and illegally we're the experts

943
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:04,430
at workarounds right yeah this far so

944
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,720
yeah we've got there's a pizza place in

945
00:40:04,429 --> 00:40:07,159
Vancouver that you show up with your oil

946
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:09,709
and you give it to them and they're wet

947
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:12,259
on the pizza for you but in terms of

948
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:15,289
legality I mean we're gonna see wills

949
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:17,298
regulations by October and Antonin so we

950
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:18,799
will have legal edibles soon but right

951
00:40:17,298 --> 00:40:20,630
now they're looking at I just care about

952
00:40:18,798 --> 00:40:22,250
the head just stand alone production

953
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:24,048
we're not gonna have house for two years

954
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:25,969
oh you won't even have a sign like

955
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:30,409
that's my problem

956
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:33,348
yeah that's one point of view but yeah

957
00:40:30,409 --> 00:40:35,000
so what would you advise to speed me you

958
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:37,400
know I look at the other models that

959
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,889
have worked obviously Colorado went

960
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,769
first in the United States California

961
00:40:39,889 --> 00:40:44,179
saw that they saw the money at the end

962
00:40:42,768 --> 00:40:46,768
of the day that's what the government

963
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:48,699
wants they want the money

964
00:40:46,768 --> 00:40:50,348
unfortunately have this kind of sell our

965
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:52,929
souls to the devil a little bit to make

966
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:55,180
this work but they will want the money

967
00:40:52,929 --> 00:40:57,518
and when they come for it hopefully you

968
00:40:55,179 --> 00:41:02,108
guys will all get licensed to be the

969

Spanish companies help scattered and

1106
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:22,380
their smaller companies and that they

need support but that they're not really

1108
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:29,039
getting it from those organizations

1109
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:32,460
right now hi I've questioned for I guess

1110
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:35,369
either David or Bernardo similar vein al

1111
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:37,588
khali bar al caliber is one of the

1112
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:39,420
largest pharmaceutical companies why

1113
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:40,769
would they allow for the association's

1114
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:43,769
to take over this very lucrative

1115
00:47:40,769 --> 00:47:46,460
business when they're better situated

1116
00:47:43,769 --> 00:47:48,780
for the medical cannabis industry oh

1117
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:51,150
that's that's what I thought I thought

1118
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:53,280
like companies like Ana coreg simple one

1119
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:56,789
of these five companies that have this

1120
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,859
huge contract and license granted by

1121
00:47:56,789 --> 00:48:02,009
government they did they just they can't

1122
00:47:58,858 --> 00:48:04,679
support them no again I'm in what way

1123
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:06,750
why would they they making big money on

1124
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:08,789
that with a license they don't want

1125
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:10,920
small small companies having a license

1126
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:12,539
we don't believe in that we believe we

1127
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,700
don't believe in the monopolized system

1128
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:18,088
we want small entities small groups of

1129
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:21,118
people if it's possible to get licensed

1130
00:48:18,088 --> 00:48:25,289
and to follow they work because it is a

1131
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:28,769
lot of experience there I think I think

1132
00:48:25,289 --> 00:48:30,480
that this is should be fairway a five

1133
00:48:28,769 --> 00:48:32,940

1134
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,969

00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:51,250
go in there um yeah so I basically is it

1159
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:52,900
is naive to assume that that there's not

1160
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:54,940
gonna be pharmaceutical companies taking

1161
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:56,980
a lion's share of medical markets in

1162
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:58,869
particular and that they should support

1163
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:00,490
recreational cannabis I mean again we've

1164
00:49:58,869 --> 00:50:02,650
seen this in the United States and in

1165
00:50:00,489 --> 00:50:03,789
Canada where they don't really support

1166
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:05,349
it because they don't really have to

1167
00:50:03,789 --> 00:50:07,029
they know that once we push it through

1168
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:09,039
they then have access to make

1169
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:10,450
pharmaceuticals out of that so they

1170
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:13,269
they're kind of in this position where

1171
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:14,909
they don't really have to do anything

1172

1173
00:50:14,909 --> 00:50:21,029
hi Lisa Pettis I work at Meadow we're a

1174
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:23,230
point-of-sale company out of California

1175
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:26,110
so we do all the software for

1176
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:27,570
dispensaries in California so I kind of

1177
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:31,329
wanted to know more on the tech side

1178
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:32,769
your experience with software obviously

1179
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:35,559
it's a little more mandated in

1180
00:50:32,769 --> 00:50:37,809
California but I'd love to know you know

1181
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:39,969
from Bernardo and David what the

1182
00:50:37,809 --> 00:50:42,989
experience has been with actually using

1183
00:50:39,969 --> 00:50:45,849
tech and being held more accountable

1184
00:50:42,989 --> 00:50:47,319
from a technical perspective in

1185
00:50:45,849 --> 00:50:49,599
California if you use is going to sound

1186
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:52,450
a lot a lot of pen and paper so these is

1187
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:54,630
a throwaway and burn if you had to but

1188
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:58,000
I'd love to kind of know what the civil

1189
00:50:54,630 --> 00:51:00,309
similarities or differences are so just

1190
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,809
quickly in Spanish and in content yeah

1191
00:51:00,309 --> 00:51:05,079
something like to fit into the Sun

ignore oh here you software but uh and

1193
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:14,829
I'll bet I see a little socially alright

1194
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:18,250
so we are using our technical support

1195
00:51:14,829 --> 00:51:21,130
and program we did by ourselves I mean

1196
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:25,539
we don't use any other platform it's

1197
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:27,160
done by by the company and mate yeah

1198
00:51:25,539 --> 00:51:29,769

muchas muchas muchas gracias Kay tell us

1227
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:14,189
what it is um so Bernardo was the saying

1228
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:15,689
that the seed to sale kind of software

1229
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,920
that you see in Canada in the United

1230
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:18,030
States isn't really in effect here

1231
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,730
because again the growing and

1232
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:22,640
distribution is illegal and we can't

1233
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:25,889
promote you know like we can't promote

1234
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:28,739
anything from our problem outside so

1235
00:53:25,889 --> 00:53:30,838
that's why also right yeah well and in

1236
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:33,779
terms of the specifically the inventory

1237
00:53:30,838 --> 00:53:35,130
tracking that that can be a problem but

1238
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:37,320
Bernardo is also saying that they use

1239
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:38,910
they do use some other types of software

1240
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,890
and I know that you probably did

1241
00:53:38,909 --> 00:53:42,509
something similar in West Hollywood that

1242
00:53:40,889 --> 00:53:45,088
we did in Vancouver where you just sort

1243
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:47,280
of adapted retail software and tried to

1244
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:49,920
make it work the best we have metric

1245
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:52,920
which is the state software and so your

1246
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:55,320
POS system has to link to the states and

1247
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,930
has to upload it's very stressful it's

1248
00:53:55,320 --> 00:54:00,720
very stressful so you have a metric POS

1249
00:53:57,929 --> 00:54:04,079
but not the metric system in the u.s. we

1250
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:06,589
we don't use metric yet we will be using

1251
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,590
measures

1252
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:11,909

possibly supporting what you're doing in

1256
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:20,339
here but I just had a question about how

1257
00:54:17,699 --> 00:54:23,329
many social clubs are actually opening

1258
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,329

obviously as new ones open and other

1273
00:55:10,949 --> 00:55:15,419
other ones closed but between 2000 and

1274
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:19,719
2500 with Barnardo's estimate of what is

1275
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:21,680
