4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,900
saturation over Supply and under

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,198
performance

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,240

have here Vera broader she's the CEO of

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,980
mhi cultivo medicinal Sr as well as

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,079
Alexander Rick who is the Chief

17
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:48,839
Operating Officer at Harper farm game

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,640
but also one of the Pioneers here in the

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,859
German cannabis industry and former CEO

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,780
of gecko Pharma

21
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:56,519
um so it's a quite interesting topic

22
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,079
here with the Cannabis cultivation we've

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,579
heard some controversy already there

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,739
have been some ongoing discussions

25
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:05,159
already in the audience

26
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:08,579
um so maybe let's start with Adrian at

27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,979
that point again and see um Edwin as a

28
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:12,658
German producer of medicinal cannabis uh

29
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:15,000
what do you think what strategies do you

30
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,040
employ to ensure a consistent Supply and

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,959
quality to navigate a competitive

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,640
European market with your own

33
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,319
cultivation but also with the Imports

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,180
that you are doing and also maybe in a

35
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,919
perspective on other countries that you

36
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,560
as a company from Germany want to get

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,780
active in yeah yeah thanks for the

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,939
introduction um you're absolutely right

39
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,019
I think the response is twofold like the

40
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:37,379
first one would be a little bit more

41
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:38,879
technical on the side of the cultivation

42
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:40,618
um I think what's really important if

43
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,500
you're producing just for the medical

44
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:45,659
Market is consistency and control and

45
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,978
we've established a facility to do just

46
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,259
that

47
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:50,938
um I would definitely suggest everyone

48
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,640
who's going into that direction to

49
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:55,258
invest into two Labs which one the first

50
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,439
will be a tissue culture lab the second

51
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,938
one would be your own QC lab and if you

52
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:01,978
have full control over the product then

53
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:04,438
consistency comes

54
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:07,679
so for our domestic production that's

55
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:10,079
our strategy we can't produce any out of

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,819
specification batches because there's no

57
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,080
Second Use in Germany so everything that

58
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:15,119
is out of specification has to be

59
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,060
destroyed and there's also no way to

60
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,500
reroute it for example for exports but

61
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,520
the second part I think is really

62
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,020
important

63
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,040
um what we're also doing is we're

64
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:28,020
offering uh GMP services so we are

65
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:31,378
importing the ACP flowers from every

66
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,780
producer that is uh like fulfills gacp

67
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:36,120
criteria where we do the audit can

68
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,039
import the flowers and we do GMP

69
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,800
processing so I think that's a really

70
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:44,098
important part also to include other

71
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,680
people into the German market and offer

72
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:49,619
flexibility to include other people's

73
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,760
over the world to produce in or sell in

74
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,439
Germany

75
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:54,719
thank you very much

76
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:57,239
um David how do you perceive

77
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,939
European ecosystem production ecosystem

78
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,340
and complex regulatory landscape that we

79
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:05,060
have here in Europe

80
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,060
well this is

81
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:13,018
okay yeah it is a challenge

82
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:16,018
as as I've heard many times the European

83
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:19,200
markets are not harmonized the way they

84
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:22,500
handle you know every aspect of the you

85
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:26,280
know the GMP aspect even the cultivation

86
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,560
the the agencies are all learning a new

87
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,158
business they're a little confused by it

88
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,739
so you know we operate we're governed by

89
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,840
agencies that really don't understand

90
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:38,878
cannabis like in Spain you know they're

91
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,039
learning cannabis they're learning with

92
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:44,459
us so it makes it very challenging

93
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:46,139
there's no right answer always you can't

94
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,420
just pick up the phone and call a

95
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:51,298
consultant and get an answer so it's uh

96
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:53,939
it's a complex regulatory uh situation

97
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:56,519
uh as everyone learns how to navigate

98
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:57,840
this cannabis this uh this herbal

99
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,680
medicine

100
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:05,098
you know as far as the cultivation goes

101
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:08,939
you made a good point uh Adrian uh you

102
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:10,500
you have to control every aspect of uh

103
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:13,259
of your operation from the tissue

104
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:17,519
culture genetics which are highly

105
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:20,159
preferred to prevent uh to bet problems

106
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,259
in your crop but also it's very

107
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,439
important that your systems and your in

108
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:27,839
your cultivation facility are designed

109
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,639
properly that's where a lot of folks go

110
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,978
wrong in the states and in Canada in the

111
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,360
past we've done about everything you can

112
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:35,339
screw up we screwed it up in the United

113
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,699
States okay so we're we're hopefully

114
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:43,039
done screwing things up but uh every

115
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:44,840
aspect of temperature humidity control

116
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,580
drying

117
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:49,560
methodologies every aspect has to be

118
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,240
precisely on are you going to have a bad

119
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,100
product are you going to have a product

120
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,978
that fails or out of spec or what have

121
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:59,580
you so that's my two cents on that one

122
00:04:55,978 --> 00:05:02,519
anyway okay thank you um so Vera you're

123
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:04,379
one of the Pioneers in Portugal can you

124
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:05,879
tell us what were factors that

125
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:07,740
contributed to the successful

126
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:10,139
establishment of a cannabis cultivation

127
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:13,439
operation in Portugal and how can

128
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:15,600
Portugal leverage its Advantage does it

129
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,879
that it has and maybe you can give us a

130
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,800
quick overview on where the Portuguese

131
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,060
Market stands at this point in terms of

132
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,120
cultivation

133
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,459
yes thank you Lisa so Portugal has been

134
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,740
very accommodating to the medical

135
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:31,500
cannabis industry in the sense that it

136
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,740
opened up its doors for investment

137
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:37,620
on the other hand the regulatory

138
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,139
framework is very conservative and one

139
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:43,139
must understand that when one invests in

140
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:45,960
cultivation in medical cannabis in

141
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:48,978
Portugal it is a long path it's the

142
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:52,918
Pharma path in a very conservative

143
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:54,719
European structure

144
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,120
and

145
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,539
many companies when they enter the

146
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,180
cultivation they are not entirely

147
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:04,918
understanding of the Pharma path and

148
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,560
that has created many difficult

149
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:10,620
situations for the Cannabis medical

150
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,660
cannabis industry alike all over Europe

151
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,879
and that's a bit the situation in

152
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,820
Portugal many many licenses many

153
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,500
licensed submissions many companies that

154
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:21,839
were set up and haven't made it through

155
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,478
because you really need to take a deep

156
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,818
breath and walk through every little

157
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,038
path

158
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:31,379
um with the first mover Advantage is

159
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:34,079
definitely uh

160
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:35,339
critical for success

161
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,500
thank you

162
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:39,418
um Alex what is your perception I mean

163
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,720
you're active in Germany and you have

164
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:44,639
operation cooperation in North Macedonia

165
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,240
um what do you think where are

166
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,060
cultivation markets going and how what

167
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:55,280
are some key considerations when setting

168
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,280
up a production for facility still

169
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,360
the most important thing is that you

170
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,479
have a very good team we have a North

171
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,479
Macedonia an amazing head grower and a

172
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:08,818
very well educated team and they are

173
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:12,060
taking control of the cultivation 24

174
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:14,400
hours seven days a week you always have

175
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:19,379
to control all the lights nutritions

176
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:22,739
water Etc so yeah you cannot sleep you

177
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:26,759
have to control the environment Etc the

178
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:29,598
whole time and the problem is to yeah to

179
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,598
cultivate a product

180
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:36,538
same amount with the same THC content so

181
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,340
that you had the specifications you

182
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:41,519
always have to produce within the

183
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:44,159
specifications otherwise you cannot sell

184
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:47,818
the product for example in Germany when

185
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,120
it's registered as a 21 THC flower then

186
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:55,740
you cannot sell it as a 25

187
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:59,098
THC flower that's not possible and yeah

188
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:03,120
when you when it comes to New Market so

189
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:06,060
I'm in the industry since 2017 and what

190
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:10,139
I really or I was always surprised that

191
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:13,079
the cultivators they have big dreams and

192
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:14,759
big ideas and they said oh we are we are

193
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:18,240
we are now building the the

194
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:21,960
state-of-the-art facility Etc so it's

195
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:25,019
good to do the homework but you should

196
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:27,180
also know the market where you want to

197
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:29,459
sell your products so in the end a lot

198
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:32,038
of producers came to me in the past and

199
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:35,158
take hey we Alexander now we have to

200
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:38,458
grow and photons and we are now looking

201
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:41,158
for customers can you help us I said no

202
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,598
now it's too late you should have come

203
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:45,539
earlier

204
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:48,200
um so um yeah in best case or I want to

205
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:50,759
give an example for the Polish market

206
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,000
the registration of the product will

207
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:56,639
take you 12 60 months or more even yeah

208
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,740
and it's very conservative everybody's

209
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:02,879
looking to Poland right now because it's

210
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:04,620
a very interesting Market uh there is no

211
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,958
insurance

212
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,360
paying the cost for the patients that's

213
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,399
why I'm always surprised that I hear

214
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,860
that it's a very big Market but if you

215
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,899
know some people there they will tell

216
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,860
you and I think what is really important

217
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:21,419
when you enter New Market you should

218
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:24,000
also know the regulation Side by

219
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:27,958
yourself and have very good contacts who

220
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,679
know who are also very good informed

221
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:33,859
what they are doing yeah

222
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:36,719
so we heard this topic of consistency

223
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:39,720
before and stable genetics

224
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,060
um David you work with genetics what is

225
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,680
your stance on how do you see the role

226
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:45,659
of genetics in overcoming Market

227
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,338
saturation to a certain extent and

228
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:49,740
underperformance challenges in the

229
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:52,140
European cannabis industry what role do

230
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,600
genetics play in this equation

231
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:57,240
yeah I see genetics as vitally important

232
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,600
to being competitive in the marketplace

233
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:03,539
um you know we saw the phenomenon in

234
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,860
Canada where certain genetics would

235
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:07,019
become popular

236
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,519
and then everybody's got their hands on

237
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:09,959
those genetics and started growing them

238
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,799
and then the prices you know just

239
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:16,199
plummet so we bought a genetics bank and

240
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:19,859
we have a genetics company where we

241
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:22,940
pheno hunt about 950 high THC genetics

242
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:27,539
we also have some one-to-ones and and

243
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:29,760
CBD genetics but we think that where we

244
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:33,319
can stand out in the market is we can

245
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:37,740
provide importers of cannabis

246
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:39,778
flowers you know and other products we

247
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:43,139
can provide them uh their exclusive

248
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:44,639
genetic from our genetics bank that they

249
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:46,980
can choose and only they would have

250
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:51,778
access to those particular genetics that

251
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:53,159
we we uh license to them permanently so

252
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:55,799
I think that that's where you can stand

253
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:58,679
out in the market as a distributor to

254
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:02,039
have access to the best genetics

255
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:04,879
uh we're totally introducing new

256
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:08,599
genetics you know over time every year

257
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:13,200
uh keep keep a really fresh

258
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:15,300
uh uh variation of genetics and uh and

259
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,640
we also uh prefer to start with tissue

260
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:19,799
culture uh clones

261
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:21,958
from from our cultivation

262
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:24,059
Adrian you're also doing tissue culture

263
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:25,559
and you're also focused on genetics uh

264
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,659
what do you think is the role of

265
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:29,759
genetics and also in scaling cultivation

266
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:31,980
operations or making genetics available

267
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,480
potentially for home cultivation and

268
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,560
those kind of topics what's your stance

269
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,440
on that

270
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:40,078
yeah we're thinking very much alike here

271
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,399
um this is also one of the focuses we

272
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,458
are we're having

273
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:47,100
so um as a little background in Germany

274
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:49,979
we're quite limited with which strains

275
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,019
we can grow currently are under our

276
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,778
government contract but we are not

277
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:55,560
limited uh for which strains we can do r

278
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:58,320
d

279
00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:00,000
so we've began that already when we

280
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,040
started our company uh if you know

281
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,159
hunted our first strains and now are

282
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:08,099
running a lot more final hands using our

283
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:10,860
TC lab and preparing a strain database

284
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,899
for Germany especially when there's a

285
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,000
wreck market with the potential of

286
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,100
cannabis Social Clubs coming online but

287
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,379
also for our home cultivators and I

288
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,959
think there's a great demand for not

289
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:25,980
only good and stable genetics but also

290
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:28,078
clean genetics we know that many kinds

291
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,839
of different diseases are very prevalent

292
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:32,759
especially in the U.S market but since

293
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:34,860
we are now also having lots of U.S

294
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:35,879
genetics here in Europe all that has

295
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,800
come over

296
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:40,379
so it's a really important thing to have

297
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:42,120
something ready in that direction and

298
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:45,139
that's also something that we definitely

299
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,639
would like to offer

300
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:49,680
there are

301
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:51,360
I already have here a couple of overlaps

302
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,638
in what you guys are all doing what

303
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,200
would you say is uh are some of the

304
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,720
lessons learned from you in Portugal

305
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,120
about collaboration and competitiveness

306
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,639
in Europe itself

307
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,820
collaboration is critical because this

308
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,220
is a starting industry

309
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:10,040
especially at Europe we have a lot of

310
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,560
experience coming from North America

311
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:16,078
from Israel but in Europe it's a whole

312
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:18,059
different ball game the Pharma

313
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:21,899
regulation is completely different than

314
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:24,539
it is in North America or Israel and the

315
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:26,220
market in itself has a lot of potential

316
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:30,899
but we're far from reaching the

317
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:32,240
potential so if we all work together and

318
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:35,278
um

319
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,820
manage to uh

320
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:41,759
find the path to help educate the far

321
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:44,839
the the market educate the doctors

322
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,059
educate help with the regulatory path

323
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:50,040
ensure that the governments understand

324
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:52,138
the Pharma economics and the

325
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:54,838
sustainability that cannabis medical

326
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:56,600
cannabis can bring to them in terms of

327
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:00,500
less

328
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:03,720
expenditure with hospital beds with

329
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:08,299
drugs that can be harmful and create

330
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:12,019
worse expenses to the government

331
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:15,838
creating also establishing the

332
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:17,220
dividing amongst us the cultivation and

333
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,740
the entry as

334
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:22,079
we ourselves Medicare in Portugal are

335
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,180
also cultivators and an EU GMP

336
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,879
manufacturing facility we also have

337
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:30,359
strategic Partnerships in terms of

338
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:32,759
genetics so together we can unite rather

339
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:36,300
than be competitors we need to

340
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:37,039
collaborate and let each other

341
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:40,919
um

342
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:42,899
outstand in in their expertise to make

343
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:45,120
this a more successful established

344
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:47,100
industry and avoid the pitfalls and the

345
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,959
mistakes done in North America and

346
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,720
Israel

347
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:54,000
yeah thank you is very important I agree

348
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,379
um Alex what do you say what role does

349
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,778
collaboration

350
00:14:55,379 --> 00:15:00,360
um play and how can everyone address

351
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:02,879
these issues of oversaturation and

352
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:06,180
ensure that there's a more effective

353
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,500
distribution of products in the market

354
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:09,120
so

355
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,179
um yeah

356
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,179
um

357
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:18,958
the authorities in Germany are very

358
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,659
different and to get products into the

359
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:25,379
market is often a challenge for foreign

360
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:27,360
producers and in the end to make an

361
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:30,600
example Bavaria you can import medical

362
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,000
cannabis flowers as an API if you

363
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:37,040
irradiate them then you need an approval

364
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:41,458
by the German bee farm then it must be

365
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:44,759
cultivated under GMB conditions and the

366
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:46,919
development last six or seven years it's

367
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:49,379
a very good development we have now the

368
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:54,198
knowledge with all the Audits and all

369
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:57,240
the GMP gsap GDP guidelines which yeah

370
00:15:54,198 --> 00:15:58,979
there was a there was a way from the old

371
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,198
pharmaceutical Market into the medical

372
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,560
cannabis market so the development I

373
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:06,259
would say is very good of course

374
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:09,359
yeah you still have

375
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:12,778
or you still have to take some some

376
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,360
challenges in Germany because

377
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:17,639
um you know for example I know an

378
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,579
example from Northland Westphalia they

379
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:22,799
have to produce other GMP conditions on

380
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:25,019
the end and maybe another company has to

381
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,939
do it on a gsep conditions to produce a

382
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:30,120
product so

383
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:33,000
um yeah sometimes it's not easy for

384
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,278
producers to launch products here and

385
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,039
yes we have an oversupply in the German

386
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:41,578
market right now

387
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:45,000
in 2000 in 2017 I thought hey when

388
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:47,879
everybody built a facility we have so

389
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,578
much Supply worldwide who can smoke all

390
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:52,919
all the flowers and take the extracts

391
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:56,698
but in the end okay we have an

392
00:16:52,919 --> 00:17:00,979
oversupply and I should or I would say

393
00:16:56,698 --> 00:17:03,419
every company has to focus on themselves

394
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:06,058
there will be something on stock you

395
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:08,578
cannot sell in the in the industry or in

396
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:10,859
the market that's the truth but in the

397
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:13,438
end that it will come to this point it

398
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:17,338
was clear in the past and now you have

399
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:20,160
to stay or you have to survive and to

400
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:22,198
offer where high quality product or it's

401
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,459
a patient-driven market for for the

402
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,160
flowers

403
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:29,400
um and in the end I would say focus on

404
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,940
yourself on your on your goals and also

405
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,700
think about new formulations yeah I mean

406
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:38,340
now we have flowers extracts a lot of

407
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:41,580
companies are thinking about more and

408
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:43,678
new dosage forms Etc are the key for the

409
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:45,178
future yeah it's a great keyword that

410
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,160
you're saying that that would have been

411
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:49,080
my follow-up question how do you see the

412
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,759
role of pharmaceutical practices and

413
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:54,240
standards in shaping the future of the

414
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:56,819
whole European cannabis industry

415
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:00,720
I mean very important you always have to

416
00:17:56,819 --> 00:18:05,038
control everything from the from the GMP

417
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,679
cultivation ghcp cultivation GDP and in

418
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:09,960
the end the monography and all the nrfs

419
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,360
out there now we have a new one for our

420
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,538
cannabidiol you have to know everything

421
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:18,019
yeah and of course the one thing has an

422
00:18:15,538 --> 00:18:20,519
effect or an impact on the other thing

423
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:22,319
often the pharmaceutical entrepreneur

424
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:25,740
says okay

425
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,899
my responsibility ends at the at the

426
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,960
door of the pharmacy

427
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:34,320
but yeah that's true but in the end you

428
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,179
should also uh know uh the challenges

429
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,099
for the pharmacies because they are

430
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:40,080
giving it to the patients and if you

431
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:41,879
produce something and in the end it's

432
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:45,599
not compliant with the NF or something

433
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:47,340
like that uh yeah then you'll have a

434
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:48,980
good product but you cannot give it to

435
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:52,500
the patients

436
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:54,839
that's another interesting aspect Adrian

437
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,640
I mean you're a physician also

438
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:58,439
um we're talking here about cultivation

439
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,360
everybody can cultivate in the end we

440
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,038
need some prescribers who are putting

441
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:04,798
everything on a prescription so the

442
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:07,440
patient can have access can you tell us

443
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:10,079
a little bit maybe about what kind of

444
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,120
leg work is necessary for advancing

445
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,798
medical knowledge and improving patient

446
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:16,918
access because I think that's something

447
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:19,918
that people are underestimating a lot

448
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:21,840
yeah I mean of course education is one

449
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,320
of the most important things as long as

450
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:27,779
it's still a purely Medical Market there

451
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:30,779
might be some changes coming up you're

452
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:33,359
probably aware of the draft legislation

453
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:35,759
that is coming out that might be that

454
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:38,159
the status of cannabis as a narcotic

455
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,319
changes and it becomes an RX that would

456
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,380
at least

457
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:44,759
help prescription in in a lot of ways

458
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,160
that it makes it much easier for many

459
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:48,779
doctors to prescribe it because um I

460
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,538
think what people underestimate when I

461
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:54,660
talk to my former colleagues for example

462
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:56,759
from from my studies many of them have

463
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,740
never given out an aquatic drug

464
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:02,160
prescription it's something that is

465
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:04,259
relatively unusual to do and so it's

466
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,179
really something new so what we're for

467
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:09,240
example doing is we're inviting doctors

468
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:11,519
over to our facility and providing like

469
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,579
a first-hand impression on how medical

470
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:17,819
cannabis is cultivated and so that they

471
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:20,339
also can see the product smell the and

472
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:21,960
so far the feedback has been really

473
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:23,819
really positive even if you invite

474
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,620
people that you don't invite because

475
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:27,659
they are already in the Cannabis field

476
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:31,439
but you invite them because they are at

477
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:33,179
the forest way possible away from it the

478
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,860
feedback was always very positive that

479
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:36,419
when they learn and understand what

480
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,879
cannabis can do

481
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:41,460
um that they are supportive of it

482
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,039
afterwards

483
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:46,140
um David uh maybe back to you uh what

484
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:48,599
are other risks and opportunities that

485
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,700
you see associated with investing in

486
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:53,099
cannabis cultivation Ventures especially

487
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,440
considering that we have this fragmented

488
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:57,859
market dynamics and Regulatory hurdles

489
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,860
in Europe

490
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:03,120
well I was I woke up this morning

491
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,298
received the article on my phone from

492
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:08,579
Forbes Magazine and it said that canopy

493
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:10,798
growth at uh

494
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:15,298
has destroyed

495
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:18,179
19 billion U.S of value over the last

496
00:21:15,298 --> 00:21:19,619
five or six years they've got about 400

497
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:23,100
million left that said they're going to

498
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:25,798
be insolvent so one of the risks of uh

499
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:28,379
importers of cannabis flowers from from

500
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:31,139
Canada and elsewhere is the supply chain

501
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:33,059
risk of the of the underlying companies

502
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,919
they're bringing in from there's very

503
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:37,740
much pain in Canada

504
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:40,080
right now uh all companies are losing

505
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,419
you know a Bunches of money not all

506
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,579
tributable to the Europe of course but

507
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:47,159
there's a supply chain risk when

508
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:49,379
bringing in uh from suppliers that

509
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:53,280
aren't reliable longer term

510
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:54,659
uh so what I would do is Hitch my wagon

511
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:58,379
to someone that's going to be there a

512
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:59,880
while and not losing money they the the

513
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,200
Canadians right now are able to sell

514
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,640
product

515
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,919
uh

516
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,200
below cost because they have an

517
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:09,179
unlimited public money supply for for

518
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,140
right now but that that'll soon change

519
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:15,240
so I think uh sticking together uh uh

520
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,220
you know partnering with suppliers that

521
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,980
are there for the long run I think is

522
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:22,980
key to being a successful Distribution

523
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,240
Company in the long term

524
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,460
and then

525
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,900
um as far as the the capital markets

526
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:31,980
right now

527
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:34,679
the the the the sentiment uh for for

528
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,900
cannabis capital is

529
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:38,519
as low as I've ever seen it uh because

530
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,919
the the sentiment in the U.S the

531
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:43,139
sentiment in Canada the sentiment really

532
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:45,900
never got too euphoric in the in Europe

533
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:47,038
but the sentiments is low as I've seen

534
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,700
it

535
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:50,038
um

536
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,840
I was telling somebody last time I asked

537
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:54,259
somebody for equity in a cannabis

538
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:57,298
company they punched me in the face okay

539
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:58,980
it's not it's not a popular thing right

540
00:22:57,298 --> 00:23:00,298
now so it makes it very challenging for

541
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,179
companies out there

542
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:04,440
to expand their operation build their

543
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:07,380
grows

544
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,840
you know do things right so what happens

545
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,039
in a cannabis business in the states and

546
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,279
elsewhere

547
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:15,960
companies tend to cut corners on the

548
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:17,759
design of their facilities because they

549
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,740
don't have access to Capital they do

550
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,179
things wrong they don't set it up right

551
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,159
very important that you design

552
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:25,880
facilities to control the cultivation

553
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:29,760
process precisely

554
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,860
we spared no expense in Spain as we

555
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:34,019
built out

556
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:36,058
our well we acquired the greenhouse

557
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:38,158
which is 1.6 million square feet state

558
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:41,038
of the art but on the conversion of

559
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,780
cannabis on a small portion of that we

560
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:44,819
spared no expense to make sure we had

561
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:47,579
control of every aspect of the

562
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:50,339
cultivation process and that cost a lot

563
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:52,798
of money but I knew that if we didn't do

564
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:54,480
it we'd be in trouble like like many of

565
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,579
those before us that have had trouble

566
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,659
with cultivation and I see it in

567
00:23:56,579 --> 00:24:00,599
Portugal

568
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:02,220
not you but some companies have ceased

569
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:04,619
operations because they had trouble with

570
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,120
cultivation it's it's about a thousand

571
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:08,219
things that can go wrong if you don't

572
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:10,019
have the proper facilities to produce

573
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,220
that cannabis reliably

574
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:13,519
you're going to run into a lot of

575
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,519
problems

576
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,600
thank you so Vera you're a marketer and

577
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,519
you studied business administration and

578
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:21,558
business management in Boston and in

579
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:24,658
Switzerland

580
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:27,058
so how do you what do you think what

581
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:29,340
strategies should be employed to

582
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:32,759
establish and expand the presence in

583
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:34,859
global cannabis markets and do you

584
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:37,798
approach building corporate Partnerships

585
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:40,019
or how are you dealing with this topic

586
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:42,720
well I think that David touched a bit on

587
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:44,759
it I think it's a time in the industry

588
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,679
we're called consolidation needs to

589
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:48,900
occur there's lots of companies

590
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:51,960
struggling because they did cut corners

591
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,759
and did not manage to create the

592
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,100
infrastructures that are required to

593
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,079
grow cannabis you said before Lisa that

594
00:24:56,099 --> 00:25:00,658
growing cannabis anybody can grow

595
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:02,819
cannabis it's true anybody can grow

596
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:05,100
cannabis but not anybody can grow it

597
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:07,259
properly and that's the biggest struggle

598
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:10,459
in this industry if you don't cut

599
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:14,460
Corners like David says and if you do

600
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:17,400
invest everything that it takes to grow

601
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:20,400
a proper flower then your chances to

602
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,679
make it are very very high and the point

603
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,140
is that there are so many companies

604
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:26,880
struggling and so many that don't

605
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,100
deserve to struggle because they are

606
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,720
very good those need that's where we

607
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:33,719
need to take be

608
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,058
keep our eyes open and find them and

609
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:39,298
consolidate our efforts because that's

610
00:25:36,058 --> 00:25:42,658
that's the path to this new era in

611
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:44,579
cannabis in medical cannabis to pave the

612
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:47,100
way another thing is to stay ahead of

613
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:49,339
the game and make sure to be Innovative

614
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:52,678
we have an r d

615
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:57,359
division in Israel that is working on

616
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:59,759
New pathologies on new formulations for

617
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:03,119
pathologies and that's the future for

618
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:05,519
this industry because as cultivation is

619
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:09,058
going it's becoming increasingly more

620
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:12,418
difficult the investment is very heavy

621
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:16,558
and the price of the Cannabis flower is

622
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:18,720
being is going down tremendously to the

623
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:21,178
point of a commodity where the Pharma

624
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,179
regulation does not allow it to be a

625
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:27,480
commodity priced product

626
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:30,538
so that's where we need to focus to

627
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,339
focus on consolidation to focus on where

628
00:26:30,538 --> 00:26:34,079
we can make a difference and to make

629
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:36,899
sure that the governments and the

630
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:39,960
regulatory regimes that keep us working

631
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:42,059
will help us sustain this industry and

632
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,700
another thing is the sustainability it

633
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:47,460
was spoken before

634
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:48,200
how sustainability is critical in in the

635
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,720
future

636
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:55,319
there's this common miscon misconception

637
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:59,640
that only indoor cultivation is correct

638
00:26:55,319 --> 00:27:02,339
and keeps makes consistency and allows

639
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,980
for high quality flowers well you have

640
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:08,058
to consider that countries like Portugal

641
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:11,400
or Spain or

642
00:27:08,058 --> 00:27:14,639
sun-driven countries where we can expand

643
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,740
on greenhouse and enjoy the benefits of

644
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,020
what nature provides us while lowering

645
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,940
our footprint are definitely the path

646
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:22,918
forward

647
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,440
thank you thank you very much

648
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:26,880
um so let's have a warm Round of

649
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,538
Applause before we open the floor

650
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,539
questions

651
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,440
are there any questions in the audience

652
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:44,640
foreign

653
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:48,080
from Netherlands so what I actually see

654
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:51,840
when you have a mature plant-based

655
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:55,019
industry then usually you have

656
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:58,980
separate professional breeding companies

657
00:27:55,019 --> 00:28:01,579
small number then you have a lot of

658
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:04,259
producers cultivating

659
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:07,079
the crop and then you have a limited

660
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:10,919
number of processing industry

661
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:12,538
making me maybe half products and then

662
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,120
you have

663
00:28:12,538 --> 00:28:18,480
companies that make the final products

664
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:21,959
like a food or a medicine

665
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,480
so what I see is in in the Cannabis

666
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,298
industry this is not

667
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,900
happening it's it's out of balance I

668
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:34,259
think that's that's a major problem

669
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:37,080
so how can we change that and just

670
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:40,339
invest in a few very professional

671
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:43,038
breeding companies have good

672
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:46,619
producers cultivators

673
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:50,179
and have a good professional processing

674
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:53,058
industry for medicines pharmaceutical

675
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:57,059
companies so so I think

676
00:28:53,058 --> 00:29:00,778
now what I I see is that companies tend

677
00:28:57,058 --> 00:29:03,538
to do everything from breeding up to

678
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:06,140
making the products and maybe they're

679
00:29:03,538 --> 00:29:09,298
all very specialized

680
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:13,020
businesses that need to be in in

681
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:13,019
different companies

682
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,820
the first I'd

683
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:19,619
um yeah I think you're right the the

684
00:29:17,819 --> 00:29:22,019
regulatory framework is just very

685
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:24,058
difficult in the current situation so if

686
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:26,778
you think about a nursery concept it's

687
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:30,960
currently pretty complicated to export

688
00:29:26,778 --> 00:29:32,940
plans from one facility to another in

689
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,100
another country but we're seeing that

690
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,320
that's happening in most of the states

691
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:39,959
in the in the US

692
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:41,939
so um I think it's definitely moving in

693
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,919
that direction but the framework is just

694
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,298
very complicated to to make it possible

695
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,799
and

696
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:49,740
um even then for the pharmaceutical

697
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:51,480
production that's just begun right we're

698
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:55,500
all learning how to do it how to do it

699
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,558
right to do something uh and do audits

700
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,640
from other companies work together

701
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:02,460
I'm pretty convinced that it's going in

702
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,559
that way in that way meanwhile I think

703
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,419
it's good to get an understanding of all

704
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:09,119
the steps a little bit also like you

705
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:11,038
said when there is no fully established

706
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:13,379
industry I think it's good for you to

707
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:15,599
know a bit of a bit of all the process

708
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,340
in the supply chain but yeah I agree

709
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:19,199
with you it will be in the future how

710
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:21,359
long it takes to get there it's very

711
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,419
difficult to say and I think depends on

712
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:26,398
changes in regulatory Frameworks

713
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:30,200
somebody wants to add anything

714
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:32,759
and even if you separate

715
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,620
during the supply chain you have

716
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:38,398
somebody who's doing the extraction Etc

717
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:41,819
the logistic companies uh everybody is

718
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:44,038
working together I know that

719
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:45,359
um or they are not separated from each

720
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:48,359
other

721
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:50,579
um and in the end yes we have a lot of

722
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:53,879
companies who are who are taking parts

723
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:55,980
of this supply chain to get the product

724
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,080
from the cultivation in the end to the

725
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:00,000
pharmacies in Germany

726
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:02,699
um I don't know if they are or there are

727
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,440
many companies in the market right now

728
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:07,558
that's true

729
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:10,740
um but is it more complicated if you do

730
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:12,480
it company or everybody's doing let's

731
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:16,140
say the extraction the next is

732
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:19,380
responsible for the logistic part or you

733
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:21,240
do it in-house like Harper does

734
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:24,960
um in the end it's always very complex

735
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:27,240
and it's there will not everybody will

736
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,819
survive in the future that's all also a

737
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,579
part of the truth

738
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:34,639
all right we have one over here

739
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:38,639
hi thank you so much

740
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:41,640
I was wondering if you can speak to uh

741
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,980
hemp cultivation in terms of industrial

742
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:46,259
applications

743
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:49,440
my understanding is at this point we

744
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:50,359
have Mercedes Audi as well as BMW having

745
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,298
a

746
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:56,939
biocarbon stemming from hemp so what do

747
00:31:54,298 --> 00:32:00,019
you see the role of all of that here in

748
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,019
Germany thank you

749
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:04,619
anybody wants to I think most of the

750
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:06,960
panelists here have their focus more on

751
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:07,918
the medical parts or the industrial hemp

752
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,259
part

753
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,340
is not really represented on this panel

754
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:14,519
I reckon

755
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:16,319
um yeah but uh if you want I can connect

756
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:18,960
you to the expert in our industry

757
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:21,599
Association in Germany for that topic

758
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,980
and then you can discuss it with him let

759
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:25,379
me ask you then on the medical side

760
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:29,000
because there's been a lot of discussion

761
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:32,460
of uh THC derived from hemp or different

762
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,960
terpenes derived from yeah and the hemp

763
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,960
and cannabis are really the same thing

764
00:32:36,058 --> 00:32:39,720
um THC level that's that's something

765
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:41,639
that's a very tricky thing we need to

766
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:45,419
talk more about standard of identity of

767
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:46,980
individual products and on the complete

768
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:48,840
value chain that they are produced in

769
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,519
and here we are looking at Medical value

770
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:52,678
chains it's something completely

771
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:56,278
different and the hemp value chains that

772
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:58,440
are mostly laid out for producing fiber

773
00:32:56,278 --> 00:33:00,419
and seeds yeah but if you really look at

774
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,058
these things like cannabinoids and

775
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:05,460
cannabis resin it's still in the in the

776
00:33:03,058 --> 00:33:07,678
bad schedule of the global drug policy

777
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:10,259
so we all have to do something in that

778
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,360
regards to First free debt so the

779
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:15,058
therapeutic potential can be used and

780
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:17,459
the industrial potential for Cosmetics

781
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:19,259
for foods and other fast-moving consumer

782
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:21,058
goods like smoker bills inhalables and

783
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:23,220
so on so forth but that's an entire

784
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:24,240
different panel I guess

785
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,460
yeah

786
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,440
actually that was exactly my question

787
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:31,679
too I was I was going to delve into the

788
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,000
the food and the nutrient uh aspects of

789
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,179
cannabis because the discussion is

790
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,940
Market saturation and just anecdotally

791
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:40,860
like in at can of Portugal last year I

792
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:43,919
had a bunch of old Farmers coming to me

793
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:47,278
and saying Hey how do I rip up all my my

794
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:50,100
apple trees and replace it all with with

795
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:51,839
hemp how do I rip up all my

796
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:54,719
um banana trees and replace it with hemp

797
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:57,740
and I said you know hemp For What and it

798
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,538
would the answer was universally flour

799
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:02,099
and and it's like well you know we we've

800
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:04,679
already seen that in North America like

801
00:34:02,099 --> 00:34:06,418
everyone died dove in to to do flower

802
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:10,019
but I mean there's still plenty of

803
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:12,000
medical or at least health related uh

804
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:13,500
constituent the aspects of the

805
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,719
constituents of this plant can provide

806
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,059
such as the oil such as the seeds I mean

807
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:19,980
I'm vegan and a lot of my protein comes

808
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:21,779
from him it's a great vegan ingredient

809
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,699
but that is something that we need to

810
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,980
discuss more but alone in the medical

811
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:27,598
sector we can already see that there's a

812
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,820
lot of over supplied we've seen the same

813
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,800
thing in CBD actually like there was a

814
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,539
spike it was a hype yeah I will talk

815
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,440
about it in my presentation and a little

816
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:36,480
bit

817
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,858
um and after that hype like we had a

818
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,898
couple of hundred companies that have

819
00:34:37,858 --> 00:34:41,759
been Consolidated the prices of the

820
00:34:39,898 --> 00:34:43,739
entire Market have dropped

821
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,560
um three years ago or four years ago you

822
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:48,959
could get over 20 000 Euro for a kilo of

823
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:51,179
CBD I said that cost you now 600 euros

824
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,159
so all this Market is messed up as well

825
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:55,619
but again this is all negatively

826
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:57,240
affected by the drug status and that's

827
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:59,280
something we need to work on so we can

828
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:01,379
really use the economic potential use it

829
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,940
as a food stuff and so on so forth and

830
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,400
in Europe here we have the additional

831
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,960
challenge of Novel food where for

832
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,240
example cannabinoids need to be

833
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,980
registered so they are safe and can be

834
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:13,459
handed out on a safe scale to end

835
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,460
consumers

836
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,760
well that was great very comprehensive

837
