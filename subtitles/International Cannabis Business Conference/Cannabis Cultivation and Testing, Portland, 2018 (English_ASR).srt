1
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,480
I will introduce the moderate and he'll

2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,520
take it from there

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,670
he is a horticultural scientists court

4
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:18,129
certified expert and a teacher and he

5
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:20,170
serves as a director of kin research

6
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:29,140
please give a warm welcome for mr. Todd

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:32,079
at dalat oh oh thank you so yeah so

8
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,929
cannabis testing for quality control for

9
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,509
safety for potency has been an integral

10
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:40,829
part of Oregon as well as just about

11
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:44,649
every other States regulated systems

12
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:48,909
Oregon did some of the some of the

13
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:50,948
earliest work on on developing testing

14
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:54,488
requirements and such and it's been a

15
00:00:50,948 --> 00:00:57,729
long long process of of changing and

16
00:00:54,488 --> 00:01:02,468
adapting to the needs to assure quality

17
00:00:57,729 --> 00:01:04,659
and safety and so so it's been an issue

18
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:07,000
that's been very intimate to to myself

19
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:10,629
and we're bringing we got three

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,370
panelists here today testing goes a lot

21
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:18,009
more beyond um testing labs

22
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:20,410
you know the Oregon farmers farmers are

23
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:23,530
basically every the whole industry is

24
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:28,629
downstream from the farmers and so we've

25
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:31,480
got a farmer Tom Lauer men here to start

26
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:34,359
to tell us about the you know some of

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,909
the cultivation aspects of quality

28
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:41,260
control and how that eventually goes

29
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:45,399
downstream to the testing labs we've got

30
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:49,090
Matt otua from Jefferson packaging and

31
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:51,520
he takes his business is taking things

32
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:54,520
from the from the grower to the retailer

33
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:58,689
providing harvest services drying and

34
00:01:54,519 --> 00:02:01,479
curing and such and then we have a

35
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:04,810
Wesley McGuire from Pyxis labs and he's

36
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:08,140
an expert in analytical chemistry in in

37
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:10,659
one of the one of the biggest labs in

38
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:14,158
Oregon which actually goes back many

39
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:18,218
years as an agricultural lab way before

40
00:02:14,158 --> 00:02:19,929
they started testing cannabis so we're

41
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:22,840
gonna give each of them a few minutes to

42
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:25,840
to tell us about their perspective on

43
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,700
cultivation and testing then I'm gonna

44
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,560
ask the panel a few questions and then

45
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:31,718
we'll open it up to you guys ask

46
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,709
questions as well so how about we start

47
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:38,650
with with farmer Tom hello thanks thanks

48
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:42,310
for having me as far as a cultivation

49
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:45,310
goes and pesticides well everybody wants

50
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:47,319
to be organic so you've really got to

51
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:50,500
know what your neighbors are doing a lot

52
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:54,188
of blow over is caused causing problems

53
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:57,250
in the testing realm you know in America

54
00:02:54,188 --> 00:03:00,128
were pretty more reactive than

55
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,289
preventive as far as testing goes on all

56
00:03:00,128 --> 00:03:07,209
aspects we can start in the food

57
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:13,899
industry in Japan it's zero parts per

58
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:15,730
million of any kind of bacteria and in

59
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,709
South Korea it's three parts per million

60
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:20,828
in Europe it's five parts per million

61
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:23,199
for the United States it's 5,000 parts

62
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:27,849
per million so we really have become a

63
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:29,738
reactive country where it favors the the

64
00:03:27,848 --> 00:03:32,018
growers and the processors and not so

65
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:33,430
much the consumers so we think we really

66
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:37,030
need to change that in the cannabis

67
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:39,729
industry we there change of laws around

68
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:42,489
the state like Washington State a couple

69
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:45,729
years ago they were having 30% failures

70
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:47,949
due to mold so what happened was one of

71
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:49,419
the lobby groups came in they lobbied

72
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:51,219
them and now they have zero percent

73
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:53,919
failure rate so that means that there's

74
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:56,560
mold out there in the system and what

75
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,870
usually happens in America is a group of

76
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,750
people look at SiC and what they'll do

77
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:04,930
is they'll go after the processor and

78
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,818
that grower and not really deal with the

79
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,370
bigger picture you know the five

80
00:04:06,818 --> 00:04:10,628
thousand parts per million of any kind

81
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,900
of fecal back to her or any kind of

82
00:04:10,628 --> 00:04:14,298
bacteria

83
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:18,290
in the end product so we really need to

84
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:21,639
be more proactive than reactive and I

85
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,639
think that's a great place to start

86
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:29,449
alright and Matt HOF hey my name is mojo

87
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:33,228
and Jefferson packing house is my

88
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:34,910
company we have a fairly unique position

89
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:36,680
in the market and that we work with a

90
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,820
lot of farms in the area we're down in

91
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,639
Southern Oregon where a lot of our

92
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:43,399
product comes from and I think 70% of

93
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,038
the producer licenses are within 72

94
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:48,500
miles of our warehouse and what we see

95
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:51,469
is kind of the results of everybody's

96
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:55,250
idea of how to cultivate we we as an

97
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:57,949
industry for the last 30 40 years the

98
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,418
thing was to be in a vacuum you know

99
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:01,340
everybody was in their own little silo

100
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:02,389
doing what they thought best and and it

101
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:03,769
was really important to not communicate

102
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:07,430
with other people about what you're

103
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:09,409
doing and it's a big transition in the

104
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,879
culture of the market to have it all be

105
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:15,889
out in the open and all be tested and

106
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:19,610
seen and so you know it's it's going

107
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:23,689
from everybody's personal view to what's

108
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:26,960
actually working and so a lot of what

109
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:29,120
we're sharing with people is it's just

110
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:32,839
the result side we're seeing that now

111
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,668
it's it's all about unit cost you know

112
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:36,408
it used to be just produce as much as

113
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:39,379
you could and as much as you could

114
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:41,569
produce with me gone and and now it's

115
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:43,129
really about like cash flow is super

116
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:45,379
important like are you are you laying

117
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:47,360
out too much cash for what this market

118
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:51,348
constructed and constricted and organ

119
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,830
can actually get back to you and so like

120
00:05:51,348 --> 00:05:56,240
as a result a big focus for our model is

121
00:05:54,829 --> 00:06:00,189
helping people with efficiency and

122
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:03,348
helping people see what really works and

123
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:04,699
you know it's in one way it's really

124
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:06,680
awesome to see it all coming through

125
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:08,288
it's awesome to see the the legal market

126
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,819
happening and it's and it's

127
00:06:08,288 --> 00:06:11,348
it's a really painful market right now

128
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:12,819
for a lot of people there are tons of

129
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:15,788
high hopes and dreams everybody thought

130
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:17,830
they had the secret to success here and

131
00:06:15,788 --> 00:06:20,019
and that might be more true when there's

132
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:21,278
more opportunity for sales but right now

133
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:24,930
you have to be really be a tight

134
00:06:21,278 --> 00:06:28,418
operator to function in this market and

135
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:31,689
yeah I mean I think I think the industry

136
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:34,209
I was in a sense of kid and you know

137
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:36,099
pain and difficulty was always a big

138
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:37,478
part of it I think as we're going

139
00:06:36,098 --> 00:06:39,218
through this transition we're seeing a

140
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:41,258
lot of the newcomers fall back off

141
00:06:39,218 --> 00:06:43,629
because they're it's they're expecting

142
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:44,979
it to be something it's not it's not you

143
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:46,569
know I got a message from a farmer and

144
00:06:44,978 --> 00:06:48,218
straight up saying like can I take over

145
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:49,778
his farm because he thought it was gonna

146
00:06:48,218 --> 00:06:53,468
be like hanging out on his tractor and

147
00:06:49,778 --> 00:06:54,728
going fishing you know it was never that

148
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:56,288
like everybody I always knew as a

149
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:59,498
producer was working hard making a

150
00:06:56,288 --> 00:07:03,218
living and I was kind of always in the

151
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:06,849
same position as a wholesaler and you

152
00:07:03,218 --> 00:07:09,939
know we we got a ways to go before this

153
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:11,860
this makes it through and on one on one

154
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:14,278
side it's really beautiful to see the

155
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,538
community that arises out of difficulty

156
00:07:14,278 --> 00:07:20,228
people come together and people drop a

157
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:22,778
lot of their resistance to you know

158
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:24,778
sharing what's going on and so the

159
00:07:22,778 --> 00:07:26,889
beautiful side of it is that people are

160
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:28,360
supporting each other and I know my

161
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:30,038
company wouldn't be here without a ton

162
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,620
of grace from last year like we had a

163
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:33,759
ton of understanding and patience with

164
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,399
us while we went through our growing

165
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,848
pains and uh and I really appreciate

166
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:42,180
that part of it and I'm glad to be a

167
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:45,699
part of this thank you

168
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,930
great thanks Matt so Wesley McGuire I

169
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:50,278
want you to tell us a little bit about

170
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:53,559
the analytical chemistry side of things

171
00:07:50,278 --> 00:07:56,949
so I've been an analytical chemist for

172
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:58,979
about ten years doing testing in food

173
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:04,389
and environmental and agricultural

174
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:09,159
fields the interesting thing about being

175
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:11,050
involved in cannabis here in Oregon is

176
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,689
I was just speaking to a colleague

177
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:17,170
outside before we came in here this is

178
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:19,779
the first time that I have been involved

179
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:21,850
in a testing market where you're

180
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:24,459
required to test for all of these

181
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:27,250
parameters cannabis growers and

182
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:31,629
producers are required to test for

183
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:35,009
potency for pesticides for residual

184
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:38,409
solvents in their extracts and so on and

185
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:42,759
well I think this is really good I think

186
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:45,909
that there are times when it puts a in

187
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:49,659
order to no amount of pressure on small

188
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:52,539
cannabis businesses and I wouldn't

189
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:55,480
advocate for that to be changed but as a

190
00:08:52,539 --> 00:09:01,120
comparison if you look at the the food

191
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:04,920
industry nationally FDA sets standards

192
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:08,529
or rather EPA sets tolerances for what

193
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:10,329
what residues are allowed on crops and

194
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:13,059
FDA enforces them

195
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:15,040
no one's required to do that testing but

196
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:18,789
anyone could be liable and that creates

197
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:20,819
a pressure that you know pushes testing

198
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:22,899
in the interest of not only

199
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,879
self-preservation for those companies

200
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:26,649
but in the interest of public health and

201
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:30,100
I definitely want to give props to

202
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:32,470
farmer Tom for bringing up that public

203
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,529
health aspect because it's a it's an

204
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:37,000
important passion of mine which is that

205
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:40,449
I think that we should really be

206
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,730
focusing our regulatory and our testing

207
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:48,129
efforts on things which could present a

208
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:50,019
health threat to the consumers of this

209
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,669
product now interesting thing about

210
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:55,899
cannabis different from other

211
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:59,469
consumables is that many cannabis users

212
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:03,569
are medical patients this is not simply

213
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:05,230
a consumable that people are using

214
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,650
recreationally although that has

215
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:11,409
definitely driven a lot of this market

216
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:14,439
but people with sometimes compromised

217
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:16,990
immune systems they may be cancer

218
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,850
patients undergoing chemotherapy using

219
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,430
cannabis products to help medicate their

220
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,899
nausea

221
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:27,250
they could be people suffering hiv/aids

222
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:29,600
and using cannabis because of the

223
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,820
anti-inflammatory benefits and the

224
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,129
benefits that they see for their immune

225
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:37,430
system response were to counteract the

226
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:39,320
effects of harsh medication these are

227
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:41,838
people that really cannot Brook

228
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:46,790
additional threats to their health in

229
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:49,520
the form of toxic residues and so I

230
00:10:46,789 --> 00:10:51,409
think in some ways organ has set

231
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:55,129
themselves up to go above and beyond

232
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:57,500
what other industries do require for

233
00:10:55,129 --> 00:11:01,189
testing but in some ways we also have a

234
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:04,039
long way to go in Oregon in particular

235
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:06,380
we have a list of 59 pesticides that we

236
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:09,679
test for residues and they were selected

237
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:12,320
based on known use and based on

238
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:15,409
potential health effects but at the same

239
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,129
time there are a thousand pesticide

240
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:21,769
products available out there and more

241
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:25,278
and and routine testing in the food

242
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:28,069
world often incorporates hundreds of

243
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:31,039
pesticides into their resident tests so

244
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:34,129
it begs the question once we know that

245
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:36,829
there is a static list required for

246
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:38,509
testing you know are there because of

247
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:43,278
these economic pressures in the oregon

248
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:45,740
rket are there unscrupulous growers or

249
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:48,950
producers out there that are using

250
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:51,379
products that you know they know aren't

251
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:53,810
being tested for I've done some research

252
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:56,570
in this area and and I found the results

253
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:58,309
kind of interesting but the one thing

254
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:01,610
that I would say is that we have the

255
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:05,299
capacity and the analytical capability

256
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:08,000
to test for more residues and to ensure

257
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:11,539
that our product is cleaner and safer

258
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
for consumers and patients alike and I

259
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:15,980
try to advocate for that I try to

260
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,990
advocate for even in the absence of

261
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:21,528
regulation for us to go above and beyond

262
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:24,169
and demonstrate that we are providing a

263
00:12:21,528 --> 00:12:27,519
safe product especially for people who

264
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:27,519
may be using it but dissing alee

265
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:33,479
good thank you so much so I'm gonna ask

266
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:34,828
the panel a few questions and so in the

267
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,389
meantime why don't you guys think of a

268
00:12:34,828 --> 00:12:38,818
few questions yourself because you'll

269
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:43,139
have the opportunity to ask them as well

270
00:12:38,818 --> 00:12:45,799
so starting with with farmer Tom you

271
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:49,789
know this last 10 years or so we've seen

272
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:53,669
probably the largest scaling up of

273
00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:55,498
canvas grow cannabis grow operations you

274
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:57,539
know we started you know maybe 10 years

275
00:12:55,499 --> 00:13:00,420
ago a lot of people had you know a 100

276
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:03,198
or 200 plants with people going barefoot

277
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:06,058
and making love to every single plant

278
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:09,328
not wearing rubber gloves or hair nets

279
00:13:06,058 --> 00:13:12,078
or even lab testing and now we're

280
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:14,578
building multi-million dollar facilities

281
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:17,219
you know with a lot of standard

282
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:19,169
operating procedures and so can you tell

283
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:22,319
us a little bit about some aspects of

284
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:24,958
scaling up that's important for growers

285
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:26,849
to pay attention to that that we may not

286
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,039
have realized from the way we did things

287
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:31,110
ten years ago well there's so much

288
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:33,948
recording that needs to go on for the

289
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:36,750
oil CC and the different you know

290
00:13:33,948 --> 00:13:38,729
government agencies that that takes up a

291
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,708
huge amount of time and then there's the

292
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:43,558
taxes that they have to worry about and

293
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:46,619
then there's the employee and the

294
00:13:43,558 --> 00:13:49,528
employee unemployment and all these

295
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,419
different taxes and regulations and the

296
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:53,370
small farmers really been burdened with

297
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:57,088
the ton of that stuff and like these

298
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:59,009
guys are most of us we're just good guys

299
00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:02,220
who love the earth and who loved a girl

300
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:03,870
good cannabis and have a good product so

301
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,778
much of us really don't know anything

302
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:09,839
about about scaling up you know right

303
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:11,789
now we're in a corporate world and the

304
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,939
the mom-and-pop small farmers are going

305
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:16,769
to be following up I mean you know like

306
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:19,349
they said they're gonna lose 80 to 90

307
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:21,328
percent of them here in the state of

308
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,699
Oregon you know over the next few years

309
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:25,678
you know that's why they're working on

310
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:29,129
out of state Commerce and and these

311
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:31,139
types of things and and they'll help you

312
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:34,620
as far as the small farmer goes and

313
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:37,169
scaling up you know you really can't do

314
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,210
things like you did in your closet you

315
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:41,099
really need somebody there

316
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,750
you need a bunch of different extra

317
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,029
people there you need somebody who's

318
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,980
gonna do inventory control and take care

319
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:49,139
of all the tagging of all the plants and

320
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,810
and all this stuff and they really need

321
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:53,939
a large workforce and it's really super

322
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:56,489
hard for them right now since the price

323
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,140
is driven down so low I know a lot of

324
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,730
farmers are paying their employees out

325
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:06,330
of their pockets and they can only do

326
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:08,009
that so long so scaling up you know

327
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:11,100
start off with what you know you can

328
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:13,439
sell and and just continue and continue

329
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:17,750
down that road I think in the end of the

330
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:20,190
day here and in Oregon and in California

331
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,879
it's not going to be so much the small

332
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:25,770
farmers we're gonna have a handful of

333
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:28,860
craft organic farmers throughout the

334
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:30,689
state it'll be you know in Eugene you

335
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,720
know and then down it's in Southern

336
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:36,000
Oregon and kind of what I suggest is you

337
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,160
know we need historical centers we need

338
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,460
some young guy to go out there and

339
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:44,159
document the last 40 years of cannabis

340
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,740
growth in these industries areas and

341
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,309
then I see you know because content is

342
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,919
king

343
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:51,779
so we get somebody out there documenting

344
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,899
all these video documenting all these

345
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:56,129
have a place where people can land

346
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:58,019
broadcast of wide over social media

347
00:15:56,129 --> 00:16:00,720
across the country then you've got a

348
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:04,949
place for people to to land and to come

349
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,810
and visit the historical centers of

350
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:09,150
cannabis here in Oregon and California

351
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:11,328
and I think that's the way it's gonna go

352
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:13,970
because all we have to do is look at

353
00:16:11,328 --> 00:16:15,378
cut flower industry used to go from here

354
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:18,230
the Willamette Valley all the way to

355
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:19,249
Mexico the Tijuana border and they're

356
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,409
not here anymore

357
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:24,439
they all went to Colombia Bolivia and

358
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:26,539
you can guarantee that's where cannabis

359
00:16:24,438 --> 00:16:28,188
cultivation is going it's only going to

360
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:30,078
be here in the States until they open it

361
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:31,998
up internationally and then the whole

362
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,708
ball is chant the game has changed and

363
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:36,649
it's a whole different world and we're

364
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:39,018
right in that position now where we see

365
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:41,058
big money coming in from Canada the

366
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:43,068
corporate world everybody's getting

367
00:16:41,058 --> 00:16:46,519
excited they're doing a lot of buyouts

368
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:47,838
in California of small companies and a

369
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:49,519
lot of these companies will do pretty

370
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,110
good its own for five or ten million

371
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,019
dollars I mean they'll be able to retire

372
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:56,600
but their dream of you know being on

373
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:59,389
national brand and taking their product

374
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,420
all the way is gonna be a lot but a lot

375
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:04,970
more difficult path so my suggestion to

376
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:07,970
Oregon and California is to create this

377
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:10,639
historical centers have tourism wrapped

378
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:12,949
around it learn about all the the oh

379
00:17:10,638 --> 00:17:14,509
geez who you know paved the way so we

380
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:16,579
can all be in this industry

381
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:19,158
bring them have them out of the darkness

382
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:21,048
and into the light documented create a

383
00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:23,000
historical place where people around the

384
00:17:21,048 --> 00:17:24,859
world I've spent a lot of time in Europe

385
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,199
and these Europeans will eat this stuff

386
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:30,019
up they will travel from all over the

387
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:33,259
world to go to Williams or to go to

388
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:37,480
Eugene and to learn about the history of

389
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:39,769
cannabis and how we all got here so it's

390
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,298
it's gonna be a tough path where all

391
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:44,599
your small farmers out there

392
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:47,028
I see diverse yourself building it brand

393
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:49,609
you know and it's tough for a farmer

394
00:17:47,028 --> 00:17:49,880
because a farmer's job is 365 days a

395
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:51,918
year

396
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,570
and there usually aren't days off and

397
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,490
you really don't have that much time to

398
00:17:53,569 --> 00:17:57,589
go out and do branding and marketing and

399
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:59,569
all the other things that go along with

400
00:17:57,589 --> 00:18:01,490
creating a realist

401
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:03,889
very good nobody can do it alone huh

402
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:06,019
that's right so I really love the

403
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:11,330
California model they've all grown

404
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:13,220
grouped up into like collective gardens

405
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:15,619
for these little micro regions down

406
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,870
there the terroirs and I see that being

407
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:20,239
a huge but a benefit to California

408
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:22,909
because they were able to keep the small

409
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,890
farmers in the play funnel it through

410
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:27,460
one processing facility and then it goes

411
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:29,690
out on one brand see it look at the

412
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,850
California I mean the hub old son

413
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:34,279
growers guilt they've got true humble

414
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:37,519
they've got like 250 farms that feed

415
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:41,029
this machine and they were able to keep

416
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:43,129
the state plenty in good humble cannabis

417
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:45,920
so tea bad Washington Oregon and

418
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:47,480
Colorado we didn't really think too far

419
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,830
ahead you know it's kind of the Wild

420
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,599
West out here we're all you know

421
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:53,019
individuals pulling themselves up by

422
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:55,609
their bootstraps that kind of stuff so

423
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:59,150
yeah good example thank you very much

424
00:18:55,609 --> 00:19:01,519
tom yeah good I wanted to ask Matt you

425
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:05,420
know businesses like yours serve a lot

426
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:08,410
of different producers and and so one

427
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:11,690
you know issue that comes up is

428
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:14,600
cross-contamination you know maybe you

429
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:16,430
know client a you know process it you

430
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:20,059
know you process something for client a

431
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:22,430
has some residual contaminants on it can

432
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:25,879
affect client be nos you have the

433
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:27,860
protocols to mitigate that so can you

434
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,070
just tell us real briefly just some of

435
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:34,240
the protocols that are necessary for for

436
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:36,409
preventing cross-contamination yeah

437
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,759
going into the business model we had a

438
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:42,140
lot of questions like is if some mold

439
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:44,390
comes in on one plan is that gonna

440
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,890
spread everywhere else the the

441
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:47,470
infrastructure in systems in the in

442
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,538
place have a lot to do with it

443
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:52,778
a lot of like your mold and everything

444
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:55,440
grows in the right conditions so our our

445
00:19:52,778 --> 00:19:58,839
system is to control the temperature

446
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,639
keep a lot of air flow up one of the

447
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:03,878
main things that I see is just

448
00:20:00,638 --> 00:20:05,500
overcrowding a product and so one of the

449
00:20:03,878 --> 00:20:07,418
big things we did is leave leave a lot

450
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,069
of extra space in our warehouse there's

451
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:10,509
which gives access to everything and you

452
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:13,058
can monitor everything see what's going

453
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:15,759
on but we really didn't have the issues

454
00:20:13,058 --> 00:20:17,918
everybody was afraid of I mean we never

455
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,028
had mold go nuts and we never had you

456
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,429
know of course you have to clean up your

457
00:20:19,028 --> 00:20:28,089
equipment between jobs you you always

458
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:30,370
want to do that anyway aside from just

459
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:36,398
keeping things clean and tidy and making

460
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:38,138
sure that good good yeah before we open

461
00:20:36,398 --> 00:20:39,398
things up to to the audience hope you're

462
00:20:38,138 --> 00:20:43,418
thinking of some good questions for our

463
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:46,349
panelists Wesley is there any aspects of

464
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:49,570
testing that that are often overlooked

465
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:53,548
in the industry or that you would like

466
00:20:49,569 --> 00:20:57,278
to see either voluntary testing or or

467
00:20:53,548 --> 00:20:59,589
required well in the u.s. cannabis

468
00:20:57,278 --> 00:21:02,740
testing regulations vary quite a bit

469
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:05,079
state to state now there are states

470
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,960
which have copied the regulations that

471
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:10,269
other states have put into place and I

472
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,210
think everyone is striving to reach a

473
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:15,429
best practices but I think there are

474
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,889
some holes one of them I mentioned a

475
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:20,798
little bit earlier which is I think that

476
00:21:17,888 --> 00:21:22,859
our scheme for pesticide testing is

477
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:25,888
nowhere near expansive enough

478
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:28,990
particularly as farmer Tom mentioned

479
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:31,240
everybody wants to be organic right in

480
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:34,450
the cannabis world we would love to

481
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:38,138
believe that our product that we produce

482
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:41,440
or consume is clean and healthy and

483
00:21:38,138 --> 00:21:44,648
natural but the only way to know that is

484
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,960
to test and when we do organic testing

485
00:21:44,648 --> 00:21:48,729
on other commodities we do much more

486
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,600
expansive testing than what's currently

487
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:56,009
required so I would like to see whether

488
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:58,949
it's driven by regulation or by

489
00:21:56,009 --> 00:22:00,390
the industry leader is wanting to

490
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,798
demonstrate that their products are

491
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:04,650
cleaner than the competition I'd like to

492
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:07,950
see expanded testing in that regard

493
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:11,280
in the same vein organ does not have any

494
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:14,100
requirements for testing of mycotoxins

495
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,660
which are the toxic metabolites left

496
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:19,379
behind by certain mold and fungus

497
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:21,179
species in my opinion I don't think that

498
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,220
the states that are doing mycotoxins

499
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:26,340
testing are looking at the right

500
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:28,200
mycotoxins but that may be a discussion

501
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:31,230
that's a little bit longer than we have

502
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:34,169
time for here today but I think

503
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:35,880
mycotoxins testing is important I also

504
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:39,390
think that heavy metals testing is

505
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:43,559
important cannabis and hemp are known

506
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:45,299
bioremediation 8 all sorts of things

507
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:48,450
from the soil that they're grown in and

508
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:50,129
from their environment and heavy metals

509
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,919
testing I think is an area of concern

510
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,030
that we should be focusing on

511
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,160
particularly with all of these things

512
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:58,889
when you take a plant and you

513
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:02,580
concentrate it into an extract all of

514
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:06,480
these potentially toxic elements come

515
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:10,710
along with it so since we're using this

516
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:13,470
stuff frequently for recreation and as

517
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:15,630
well as for medicating ourselves I think

518
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:18,600
we owe it to ourselves and to the

519
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:20,660
consumers and patients to make sure that

520
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:24,418
it's as safe as possible

521
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:26,130
great thank you thank you and yeah you

522
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:27,600
know as a horticultural starting to run

523
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,740
out a little bit of time now you want to

524
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:32,039
take questions we're getting very good

525
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,900
indeed we're yep we're right there yeah

526
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:36,569
as a horticultural scientist I also have

527
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:39,330
a great desire to see a lot of you know

528
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:42,659
we've nutrient analysis soil nutrient

529
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:45,689
analysis microbial biomass and such just

530
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:47,370
to throw it out there anyway um yeah

531
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:49,019
it's time I hope you guys got some good

532
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:51,000
questions for a panelist and guy who's

533
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:53,450
got the mic let's hear for the panel one

534
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,450
more time

535
00:23:53,940 --> 00:24:02,350
anyone have any questions once again you

536
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:05,889
guys are so thorough or everybody's so

537
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:09,538
stoned full of ice cream yeah there's a

538
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:09,538
question over here okay here I come I

539
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,740
thank you all for your thoughts and I

540
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:16,900
think the question might be directed at

541
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:18,819
Wesley I appreciate your comments on

542
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:21,548
expanding the pesticide list and maybe

543
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:24,279
looking at additional contaminants are

544
00:24:21,548 --> 00:24:26,319
there any ways that you would see that I

545
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:28,298
guess what would the cost implications

546
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:31,509
beyond that you know looking at the

547
00:24:28,298 --> 00:24:34,179
batch size of 15 pounds in Oregon a 55

548
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:35,890
50-pound batch in California it would

549
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:38,620
representative sampling allow us to

550
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:40,750
maybe enhance enlarge the batch size and

551
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:43,928
then you know be able to have additional

552
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:45,819
analytes or are there other ways that

553
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:49,210
you would anybody on the panel see as a

554
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:52,210
creative way to expand the testing but

555
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:53,950
also keep cost the same or reduce it by

556
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,659
either expanding the badge or moving a

557
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:57,069
duplicated so on and so forth

558
00:24:55,659 --> 00:25:00,039
well I think that's a really relevant

559
00:24:57,069 --> 00:25:03,490
question and as both Matt and Tom

560
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:06,990
touched on because of the way the market

561
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:10,659
and organ has developed it puts a lot of

562
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:12,819
pressure on growers particularly small

563
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:15,549
growers to try to be profitable and to

564
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:17,408
try to stay in business and the more

565
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:21,819
testing that we do you know testing is

566
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:23,799
not cheap yes the pricing of testing is

567
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:25,720
being driven down but at the same time

568
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:28,240
there is a certain level of expertise

569
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,860
expensive instrumentation and facilities

570
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,380
that need to be maintained and and

571
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:34,839
there's a point past which labs can't

572
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:37,000
lower their prices any further I do

573
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:40,959
think that you may be on the right track

574
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:45,450
in terms of lot size I think

575
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:49,360
the 15-pound lot makes sense from

576
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:52,690
perspective of small batch grower but

577
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:56,199
from the perspective of industry so I'm

578
00:25:52,690 --> 00:26:00,120
not sure what the right approach is from

579
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:04,750
a regulatory side to limit that cost

580
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:08,079
however I do know that the that better

581
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:11,440
testing services are available for those

582
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:15,309
who want to be conscientious about the

583
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,200
safety of their product and and I think

584
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:20,109
that if you build a good relationship

585
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,269
with a laboratory they can do a lot to

586
00:26:20,109 --> 00:26:23,740
work with you on pricing we don't have a

587
00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:26,740
whole lot of control over the

588
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:28,990
regulations that specify how much of

589
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,549
each lot needs to be tested but I think

590
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:34,089
if you compare cannabis to other

591
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:37,539
industries that 15-pound lot size may

592
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:40,329
need to be reconsidered I also think

593
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:42,909
that the state tax system should pick a

594
00:26:40,329 --> 00:26:45,129
part of the testing bill for sure

595
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:47,710
because you really can't pour all of

596
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:49,720
this responsibility onto the farmer I

597
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:51,819
think that they should be using the tax

598
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,769
dollars that they generate to help

599
00:26:51,819 --> 00:27:01,689
subsidize the testing that's needed to

600
00:26:53,769 --> 00:27:03,700
keep the public safe really quickly to

601
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,769
add to that I would say again in

602
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,289
comparison to food it's not just the

603
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:11,740
growers that are testing distributors

604
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:14,279
tests retailers tests and ultimately the

605
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:16,599
the job of policing and enforcing

606
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:17,829
potentially toxic residues is on the

607
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:20,379
regulatory agency

608
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:22,179
so what farmer Tong saying is not

609
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,460
without merit

610
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:26,190
you know if we want in Oregon or

611
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:29,140
elsewhere to know that we are

612
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:35,799
distributing clean product organs it

613
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:38,110
bears some responsibility my question is

614
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:41,730
about laboratory testing and how there

615
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:44,099
is a lack of oversight and

616
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:47,750
I believe this cannabis Commission in

617
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:51,269
Oregon is talking about creating a

618
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:54,599
laboratory that would oversee the or lap

619
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:56,670
labs how do you guys feel about that do

620
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:59,939
you feel like there's a real need for

621
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:01,800
that I absolutely feel like there is a

622
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,210
need for that and I wish that we had

623
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:04,529
more than a minute and a half to talk

624
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:07,319
about it because it's something I'm very

625
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:10,259
passionate about there are a number of

626
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:13,409
laboratories in Oregon that were

627
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:15,180
basically built entirely to service the

628
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:17,430
cannabis industry in the last couple of

629
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,750
years my lab is not one of them we've

630
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:21,060
been doing food and environmental

631
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:22,559
testing for a long time but one of the

632
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:24,599
things that makes it really hard for

633
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:28,349
labs like that to compete is that they

634
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:30,689
are dependent on cannabis business in

635
00:28:28,349 --> 00:28:33,240
order to keep their doors open and what

636
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:37,019
that means is that when they are

637
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:40,680
pressured by sometimes big and lucrative

638
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:43,859
cannabis business to give to deliver the

639
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:46,680
numbers that seem favorable they may be

640
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:49,529
required to fold and Bend to that and I

641
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:51,779
think that compromises our scientific

642
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:54,690
ethics and I think the only real

643
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:58,410
solution for that is oversight now or

644
00:28:54,690 --> 00:29:00,570
lap is supposed to be delivering that

645
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:01,920
oversight for organs cannabis

646
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:05,759
laboratories but they're spread way too

647
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:08,970
thin and one of the results of this is

648
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:12,119
that laboratories are unfairly pressured

649
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:15,960
to compete on potency numbers and there

650
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:19,259
is an ongoing issue in Oregon with a

651
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:22,590
pretty rampant potency fraud since those

652
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:26,220
THC numbers do drive sales I think

653
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:28,259
education of all levels of the market of

654
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,839
the industry is going to help with that

655
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:33,420
educating consumers educating business

656
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:36,299
owners even educating regulators to a

657
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:37,830
certain extent but oversight of the

658
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:40,589
laboratories and making sure that we're

659
00:29:37,829 --> 00:29:44,220
committed to quality data systems is
