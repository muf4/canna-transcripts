12
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:48,238
inviting me here for having me

13
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:50,558
here um yeah I started to visit my first

14
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:53,599
Cannabis Conference back in

15
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:55,759
2017 and uh by that time the first CBD

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,600
products came up and nobody really know

17
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,679
knew how to handle that from a legal

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,198
point of view so I took a deep dive into

19
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:05,198
that and u i uh started a Blog and

20
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:08,118
published some articles and because of

21
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:10,000
that I was invited to the MJ day League

22
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:11,438
conference in Toronto and became member

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,959
of the international cannabis Bar

24
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:17,438
Association and since 2017 we got a a

25
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:20,158
whole set of new regulations which I

26
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:22,279
want to introduce you today but first of

27
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,520
all let me say the new regulations are

28
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,000
in place since April this year and a big

29
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,920
relief went through the country uh the

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,478
big relief starting with the prosecut

31
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,240
UTS the judges the police and at least

32
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:39,039
the consumers so this was a really

33
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,919
really good decision it's not so far as

34
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,118
we have all wished but it's a big step

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,640
and a big relief in in Germany so U that

36
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:51,718
was a very good development and we will

37
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:55,840
take a look at the details

38
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:58,559
now yeah the CBD market so you see here

39
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,439
different products CBD gummies Edibles

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,519
chewing gums uh

41
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:05,559
um

42
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:08,959
Beverages and uh at the last product we

43
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:12,680
had we saw was the CBD oil but as a

44
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:15,560
cosmetic mouth care product come to that

45
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,840
later so the hype of CBD the CBD Market

46
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,280
is definitely over the enforcement of

47
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,000
the novel food regulations since 2019

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,840
was pretty successful and CBD oils are

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,400
no longer are not longer on the market

50
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:31,120
as food even the shelves of the big

51
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,159
retailers withdraw all these products

52
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,120
and now it is mainly marketed as a

53
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:39,199
cosmetic oral care product but this is

54
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,800
also very very small numbers right now

55
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,560
and uh we saw still partly persecution

56
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,360
on the ground of the narcotic act that

57
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,598
stopped now and we'll get a new law for

58
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,640
these products um as well which I will

59
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:53,479
explain

60
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:55,679
later and the um important thing is

61
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:57,919
these applications for approval as noal

62
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,439
food are on the way especially the

63
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,799
application of the European Industrial

64
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:05,359
Hemp as Association the Iha they did 80%

65
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,640
of the way and the final results are

66
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,720
expected in

67
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:12,439
2025 um the toxicological studies are on

68
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:15,519
the way there is a big um study starting

69
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:19,840
in Portugal with 400 participants

70
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:23,039
participants uh and we expect that the u

71
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:27,120
u uh authorization by the EU commission

72
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:29,759
will be granted at the end of 2025 for

73
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,239
full spectrum products a little bit ear

74
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,280
earlier for

75
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:36,840
isolates so with that you can Market CBD

76
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,158
products again as a supplement and as a

77
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,158
food

78
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,039
product yeah there was this one study

79
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,719
from Belgium a cosmetic study and they

80
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:51,120
found out that CBD has a

81
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:54,919
antibacterial effect in the cavity uh so

82
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,879
it's the new mouth care product 2.0 uh

83
00:03:54,919 --> 00:04:02,479
as as they say it it and that was the

84
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:04,518
reason why companies started to um uh

85
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:08,039
distribute these products as a cosmetic

86
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:10,480
Oral Care spray with hemp leaf

87
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:16,639
extract and

88
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:20,959
uh then we had two decisions uh who um

89
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:24,600
uh confirmed that this um distribution

90
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,360
way is possible that was in Hamburg even

91
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,439
in the court of appeal confirmed

92
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:35,199
that uh and one in dorf that was my

93
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:37,439
decision I was working on that um and um

94
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,120
yeah as it is it's not food since

95
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,918
absorption through the oral mucosa does

96
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,038
not represent absorption through the

97
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:47,399
gastro International tract no

98
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:50,680
application of the NF novel food

99
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:52,799
regulation uh and uh it all also depends

100
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,639
on the expectation of the consumer so if

101
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,439
you write on the product it's only for

102
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,439
the overal care um then the consumer

103
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:02,000
will respect that and that was the

104
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:03,680
confirmation of the

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,600
court

106
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,120
but we have other Court decisions in

107
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:13,199
Berlin in munic and in B buen saying

108
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:16,120
exactly the same the opposite thing uh

109
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,759
so it's very hard to uh comprehend that

110
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,280
to to get through this uh with logic so

111
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,240
you have the situation that you can

112
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:27,119
distribute these products in dorf and in

113
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,879
Hamburg but not in the rest of Germany

114
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,000
so the uh authorization as a novel food

115
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:36,360
is indispensable for the CBD Market um

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,560
otherwise you we won't be able to uh to

117
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:43,280
revive this Market this Market

118
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,918
again okay you see this here the other

119
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:49,638
problem is which came up the last two

120
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:54,120
years is uh the uh pharmacological

121
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:57,478
effect of CBD products um and there was

122
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,319
one um uh decision from the colog

123
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:02,719
administrative Court saying that CBD o

124
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,479
CBD oil should in principle be medicinal

125
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,680
products even if underdosed there was in

126
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:09,800
this case it was 18 milligram CBD

127
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,478
recommendation intake per

128
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:16,720
day uh and uh then the news came from

129
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:19,000
the FSA from the UK uh they came came

130
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,720
from 70 milligram per day daily intake

131
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,120
and now recommend 10 milligram CBD

132
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,440
intake per day otherwise it would be a

133
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:30,800
medicinal product but the European court

134
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:33,360
of justice explicitly says uh that uh

135
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,199
you need uh exceeded that you need to

136
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,520
exceed a significant threshold and you

137
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:40,960
have to prove that in every case so this

138
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:43,680
decision is against European Court

139
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,879
decisions you against European law uh

140
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:51,120
but we will have to take a look on this

141
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:55,038
this will be U probably uh will be U

142
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,439
yeah in the courtroom again with this

143
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:00,560
question but of course the results of

144
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,800
the no food application from the AA will

145
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,038
be taken into account as well they just

146
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,439
finding out that this is

147
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:12,839
safe okay then we have the other CBD

148
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:15,319
Market we have U flowers and hemp leaf

149
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:17,598
tea there's a great demand very popular

150
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:20,319
in Germany CBD flowers they are all over

151
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:23,120
the place from from the south of Germany

152
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:27,639
to the north of Germany sold in Kiosk

153
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:30,598
and petrol stations and supermarkets

154
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:33,360
Etc uh but the LA law enforcement de CBD

155
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:34,800
flowers as an arotic due to a possible

156
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,280
risk of

157
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,918
intoxication um police raids and Court

158
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:42,478
sentences against Traders happen on a

159
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:44,839
daily basis still still right now uh and

160
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:47,279
the problem is uh that in Annex one of

161
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:50,279
the narcotic act and now in the in the

162
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,758
kakang in the consume cannabis law there

163
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:55,719
was this Clause that a misuse of

164
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:59,158
intoxication has to be ruled out how can

165
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,960
you intoxicate yourself with hemp anyone

166
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:03,959
has an

167
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:06,519
idea okay the the the high court of

168
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:08,799
Germany the federal uh the federal high

169
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:12,799
court of justice said if you bake 15

170
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:15,360
gram of CBD flowers into a cookie and

171
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,199
DEC carboxilate it bake it and then eat

172
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,479
it there may be the chance that you can

173
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:27,520
intoxicate yourself with 50 milligram of

174
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:30,158
THC yeah U you have to pay €50 for that

175
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:33,120
um and you have to eat this

176
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:36,479
why these this brownie then but that was

177
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,080
the uh the the the the yeah that was the

178
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,879
the consequence of this um expert saying

179
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,680
2,000 in one of these cases um that this

180
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:46,399
might be possible and because of that

181
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:49,759
all the police rates and all the

182
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:54,679
sentencing uh took place so but now we

183
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:57,919
get a new law uh the uh draft is already

184
00:08:54,679 --> 00:09:01,439
there the associations can take part in

185
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:03,838
in a hearing and is scheduled to come

186
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,959
into Force at the 1st of January

187
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:11,120
2025 uh and this law will delete these

188
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:13,719
misuse of intoxication Clause big big

189
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,078
big progress for the whole sector we had

190
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,120
Farmers confiscating or we had

191
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:21,239
prosecution officers confiscating whole

192
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:24,078
hemp Fields whole hemp Fields because of

193
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,278
this clause and uh it's really really

194
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:30,120
about time that this will that this will

195
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:33,439
stop and uh CBD flowers and hemp Leaf te

196
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,560
will be freely marketable after the 1 of

197
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,240
January

198
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:42,000
2025

199
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:44,879
um and um but of course it's 0.3 not

200
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,600
like 1.3 like here in like in the Czech

201
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:52,519
Republic we heard or what you guys are

202
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,519
introducing here and if you have

203
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,759
a if you have such a low threshold for

204
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,480
THC the practice was that uh the

205
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:06,000
genetics from Switzerland they have 0.5

206
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,800
0.6 0.7 too much for the German market

207
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,440
so what did they did they do they washed

208
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:14,039
it down in washing streets with solvents

209
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,560
uh and added and by that you wash away

210
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:19,480
as well the CBD and the Turpin and you

211
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:22,199
have product which is like nothing you

212
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,800
rape the plant so to say and then you

213
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,959
add um artificial turpins and CBD again

214
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:29,359
on the product so that you have a smell

215
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:31,199
and that you have CBD on it um and then

216
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,560
you sell it in the German Market I think

217
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,959
this is unbearable practice has to stop

218
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:39,278
somehow so please think about better

219
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:42,159
genetics because the consumer wants

220
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:44,439
these butlike uh uh products and you

221
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,799
can't get that with 0.2 or 0.3 with a

222
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:51,399
European variety you need another

223
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:53,359
variety like 0.5 0.6 uh but um this

224
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:55,600
product shouldn't be on the market uh in

225
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,879
in any in in the in the first place so

226
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,639
let's see how this will

227
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:04,360
develop okay yeah we have to to uh to

228
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:06,639
love we we suit the for two clients we

229
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,320
suit the federal government of Germany

230
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,079
on the grounds of the free movement of

231
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,879
goods principle because these CBD

232
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:15,559
flowers are legal in Austria Belgium and

233
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:17,320
Luxembourg so we said if they are legal

234
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:19,159
there they have to be legal in Germany

235
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,720
on the grounds of the free movement of

236
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:24,360
goods principle these lawsuits are

237
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,120
pending in at the administrative Court

238
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:30,039
of brke right now uh and if the law

239
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,919
comes at in effect at the 1 of Jan

240
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:36,240
these um law fluts lawsuits are

241
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:39,799
Obsolete and but I talked to the judge

242
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,959
and he's thinking about having a hearing

243
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:44,639
uh this Autumn so maybe this decision

244
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:48,000
comes first or the change of the law

245
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,000
comes first we have to

246
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:54,880
see okay conclusions CBD oils extracts

247
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:58,919
isolates are not marketable as food now

248
00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:01,958
CBD infus Edibles beverages gummies Etc

249
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:03,679
CB D oils as cosmetic Oral Care Products

250
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:06,039
partly marketable certain regions of

251
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:08,199
Germany if correctly

252
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:11,639
labeled uh we have the novel food

253
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,120
authorization by the ukom commission

254
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:17,360
indispensable now marketability of CBD

255
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:19,759
flowers we will see CBD cosmetic and CBD

256
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,029
liquids are marketable if no Health

257
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,278
claims are made I forgot

258
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:27,078
[Music]

259
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:29,720
to yeah here you have

260
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:31,638
um you have to write on the label with

261
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,920
these Oral Care Products it's not

262
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:34,919
suitable for

263
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:37,000
consumption you have to spit it out

264
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,319
after certain seconds and do not swallow

265
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,559
that's what you have to label on the

266
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,160
product there so pretty silly and not

267
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:44,159
good for

268
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:51,639
marketing okay then we have hhc as well

269
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,519
on the German Market very popular two

270
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:57,839
years uh eventually it was stopped in

271
00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:02,679
June this year due to an amandement of

272
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:08,160
the new psychoactive Substances Act so

273
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:09,479
hhc H4 CBD thcp they are all banned Now

274
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:16,360
by federal

275
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:20,399
law um and uh the new uh cannaboids are

276
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:22,519
already there 10 hhc or 10 hydroxy uh

277
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,480
and I think you can't win the race

278
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:27,120
against the development of new

279
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,159
semisynthetic cannabinoids you better

280
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,278
take the check rout as we learned this

281
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:35,159
morning regulate them all or regulate

282
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:37,639
all non internationally regulated

283
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:41,439
substances or products in a in a special

284
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:44,278
law and uh don't push it into the

285
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,360
illegal Market again uh issue licenses

286
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:49,559
take care of prevention take care that

287
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,759
the uh the Traders are obliged to give

288
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,879
information material prevention in

289
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,480
information Etc I think this is the

290
00:13:53,879 --> 00:14:00,078
better way but we because you can't you

291
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,079
can't win this race

292
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,839
same with katom not very popular unless

293
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,959
unlike in the Czech Republic when you go

294
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,880
to Cana Fest in

295
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:14,679
Prague uh you will see Kum everywhere

296
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:17,159
they are selling it in the booth on the

297
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:19,519
on the grounds there uh so that was the

298
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:21,039
reason why Czech Republic is taking care

299
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,320
of this I

300
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:26,679
guess and um it's good that they have

301
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,560
this this approach with this new cycl

302
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:32,159
motor Substances Act we suggest that

303
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:35,000
from the organizations to the Ministry

304
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:37,600
of Agriculture to do the same and the

305
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,639
Ministry of Health in Germany let's see

306
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,480
how this will develop if uh the Czech

307
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:45,440
Republic makes progress on

308
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,120
that okay then adult use U yeah we

309
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,800
started in November

310
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:54,039
2021 uh the new Coalition came into

311
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:56,879
place and the Coalition negotiations

312
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:59,039
took place and uh they said we are

313
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:01,240
introducing the controll distribution of

314
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,958
cannabis to adults for consumption

315
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:07,560
purposes in licensed source so a

316
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:11,599
complete commercial route was intended

317
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:14,919
to for all these for all these um

318
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:18,000
esteemed uh goals like Health protection

319
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:20,000
child and use protection product quality

320
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,639
and illegal market and crime

321
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,159
displacement what came out was what we

322
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,600
see now uh there were several legal

323
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:30,120
problems along with this legalization

324
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:34,000
especially the single convention the

325
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,919
mother of all evil um which restrict the

326
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,879
traits of cannabis to Scientific and

327
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,879
medical purposes article

328
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,000
four there were several solutions to

329
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:46,559
solve these

330
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,879
International

331
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,359
obligations like Canada like a

332
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:54,318
respectful non-compliance which which

333
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:59,759
Canada does unscheduling of cannabis

334
00:15:54,318 --> 00:16:03,719
very unlikely U amandement um uh via a

335
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:06,680
simple procedure how also highly unlegal

336
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,519
but could trigger useful political

337
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:11,799
debate and uh the most popular was the

338
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,360
termination of the single convention uh

339
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:16,958
and the re accession with the

340
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,959
reservation of cannabis that was what U

341
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:22,439
Bolivia did for Koka and that was the

342
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:25,000
model what we thought the German

343
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,440
government would do uh for for cannabis

344
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,360
and then these inter modification

345
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:34,800
procedures then you can uh negotiate uh

346
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,120
trade deals with Canada for example that

347
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:39,318
um you can modify the rules of the

348
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,360
single convention interp

349
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:44,559
partis and start trading cannabis

350
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,919
recreational

351
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:50,599
Cannabis but this was too complicated

352
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:53,278
too much time too much effort involved

353
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,040
too much diplomatic and uh political

354
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:58,159
issues so the German government decided

355
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:00,958
not to do that um and the European

356
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:03,000
problems is article 71 of the Shen

357
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,879
contract this is only relevant for

358
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,798
transborder situations so not really a

359
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,919
problem but this article two of the

360
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,679
framework

361
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:16,439
decision G also talked about this

362
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:21,160
morning um and uh saying the same like

363
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:24,480
the single convention uh only uh for uh

364
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:27,319
scientific and medical purposes but uh

365
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,759
jinri pointed this as well it's article

366
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:32,519
two number two

367
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:36,200
uh exclusively for their own personal

368
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:40,879
consumption as defined by national law

369
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:45,279
and this rule or this black letter law

370
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:48,000
uh came was interpreted like this that

371
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:49,639
you can have two columns uh column one

372
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,359
and column two column one is deep

373
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:56,200
criminalization of 25 program possession

374
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:58,519
in public and 50 g at home homegrown of

375
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:03,519
three living plants Harvest limited to

376
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:06,319
50 gr successively harvesting was one

377
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:08,240
phrase in the reasoning of the law uh if

378
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:09,639
you now about cannabis you know if if

379
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,798
you have to harvest you have to harvest

380
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,679
the whole plant and you can't

381
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:17,359
successively harvest the plant so very

382
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:19,720
silly and uh cannabis cultivation clubs

383
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:22,839
for Collective home growing because they

384
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,679
are privileged under a un agreement and

385
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:27,839
EU law so that was the results now

386
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:31,960
Edibles allowed now exraction allowed

387
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:34,599
except of CBD but hashish and life Rosen

388
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:38,038
um this is because our health Minister K

389
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:42,158
laak was in Canada and always heard the

390
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:43,759
stories of little kids and child having

391
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:45,919
to go to hospital because they were

392
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:48,279
eating Edibles with THC because their

393
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,480
parents didn't secure that properly and

394
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:52,359
so he said now edibles but wasn't

395
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,120
thinking about that you can have life

396
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:58,839
Rosen with high concentrates uh

397
00:18:55,119 --> 00:19:02,798
concentration of THC as well so you you

398
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:06,000
see it's not so easy to set up logic and

399
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:09,000
sound cannabis law column two model

400
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
projects we'll see in a

401
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:18,720
minute yeah um exactly oh hang

402
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:21,000
on yeah you see here details column one

403
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,919
cannabis handling almost everything is

404
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,759
still forbidden it's forbidden

405
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:29,320
possession possession growing producing

406
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:31,558
trade import export um to obtain

407
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:34,639
cannabis or to dispense or distribute

408
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:37,399
cannabis so if you have your own Harvest

409
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,400
of 50 gram and you give 50 gr to your

410
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,679
neighbor or to your friend criminal

411
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:46,159
offense not possible if you use your

412
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:47,759
cannabis for a fat extraction at home to

413
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:50,640
uh to produce

414
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:53,200
cookies not allowed fat is an extraction

415
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:57,759
is a solvent uh not allowed criminal

416
00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:00,319
offense so uh but then we have these

417
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:02,599
exemptions so so it's a very very uh

418
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:05,918
restrictive approach and you have to

419
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:05,918
find your way through that

420
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,679
law yeah we have the consumtion bands

421
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,159
bands in public areas 100 meter from

422
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,320
kindergartens

423
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:18,360
playgrounds um prohibition of

424
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,759
consumption near children and minors

425
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:23,639
also for medical pish patients this is a

426
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:25,759
real disadvantage in comparison to the

427
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,320
former legal

428
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:31,798
situation and numerous new conflicting

429
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:34,000
panel and fine regulations it's a sexy

430
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:35,679
we have 45

431
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,720
paragraphs sometimes they are

432
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:43,519
contradicting themselves um so uh really

433
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:47,279
crazy uh this law needs a a rehaul very

434
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:49,200
very soon to make it sound again um yeah

435
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:52,599
cannabis possession consumption still

436
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,960
stigmatized by this

437
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:59,319
law okay then we have seeds and clowns

438
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:01,798
uh seats were deemed as an n otic ever

439
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:05,960
since in Germany not like in Czech

440
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:08,639
Republic or in Spain uh and the new law

441
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,400
took over the um definition the

442
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,440
International International definition

443
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,759
for cannabis means the flowering or

444
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,919
fruiting tops only if you have fling or

445
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:20,599
fluting tops it's cannabis in the sense

446
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:23,240
of the law so quite easy if the Cannabis

447
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:26,038
is not flowering it's not cannabis you

448
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,798
can trade it you can legally trade it uh

449
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:33,038
you can give it away to a a colleag or

450
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:37,558
friend or whatever uh and um what

451
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:40,278
happened then is that

452
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:42,278
um the seed importation for hom growing

453
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:44,960
cation clubs from within the EU is

454
00:21:42,278 --> 00:21:45,960
possible as seeds are not listed in the

455
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,319
single

456
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,600
convention uh and also domestic

457
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,359
commercial trade is possible that's

458
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:55,079
clear by now but what's not possible to

459
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:58,240
produce seeds because if as long as the

460
00:21:55,079 --> 00:22:00,960
seed is at the plant uh it's cultivation

461
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:04,038
of can and you don't have a license to

462
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,360
do so unless you are a cultivation club

463
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:11,319
which is which are not in operation

464
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:14,278
right now uh so uh like a miracle uh the

465
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:16,200
seed is uh separated from the the plant

466
00:22:14,278 --> 00:22:18,679
and you have a legal product because

467
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,000
it's not cultivation anymore uh very

468
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:23,159
strange

469
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:29,159
so and you can't import it from third

470
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:32,159
countries uh because you have to um uh

471
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:34,559
because the EU EU law forbids that you

472
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,840
can't import hemp from third countries

473
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:38,240
then you have to have a special

474
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:42,038
permission and you have to talk to the

475
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,000
EU commission Etc so they somehow have

476
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:47,240
to appear in the European Union then

477
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,839
they are legal um and that's um yeah we

478
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:55,640
have to deal with that um but the um the

479
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:58,678
clowns is a problem we had couple of

480
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:02,000
seizures of clowns from commercial

481
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:05,360
Traders uh because there was a very

482
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,319
misinterpret uh reasoning to the law

483
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:11,599
which says if you cut the catling put it

484
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:15,759
plant it in uh then it is a Seedling and

485
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:19,519
In This Moment it's cannabis again okay

486
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:22,640
uh that was in the reasoning uh um it

487
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:25,000
was taken over into a commentary in a in

488
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,440
a law commentary uh and this was the

489
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,240
reason for police to go after clone

490
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,120
Traders again

491
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:34,079
uh it's wrong it's so obviously wrong

492
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:36,759
because the definition is clear if there

493
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:39,399
is no flowering top it's not cannabis we

494
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:41,679
will have to see how that will work out

495
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,320
but in fact in principle we have two new

496
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,519
legal products on the market which is

497
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:46,519
seeds and

498
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:54,278
clones yeah some more details of column

499
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:57,798
one we have the cultivation associations

500
00:23:54,278 --> 00:24:00,119
yeah go through that um it's uh it's a

501
00:23:57,798 --> 00:24:02,319
bureaucratic overkill for for cannabis

502
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:05,959
clubs uh we have

503
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:08,519
280 uh applications right now uh in in

504
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:11,079
in whole of Germany uh a couple of

505
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:14,079
handful were were granted uh

506
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:16,918
authorization already uh but under

507
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:19,798
reservation because uh the prevention

508
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,799
officers haven't been appointed yet

509
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:23,200
because there were no C courses for

510
00:24:21,798 --> 00:24:27,319
these prevention officers which they

511
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:30,480
have to uh fulfill which they have to do

512
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:33,639
because they weren't yet so

513
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:37,120
um I don't think this cannabis

514
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:39,520
Association model will be a success uh

515
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:42,879
let's see if a couple of clubs next year

516
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:46,679
will be able to be uh

517
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:49,039
to uh be able to yeah to put some

518
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:51,960
products on the market maybe a handful I

519
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:54,480
guess but not really on a large scale

520
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,200
throughout throughout Germany and yeah

521
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,839
this was driven by over complying with

522
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,640
International and EU obligations

523
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:03,798
and a healthy policy alism by the

524
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:07,080
federal health Ministry rather than a

525
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:08,639
human rights and Justice

526
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:12,398
approach

527
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,640
okay yeah the model project there were a

528
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:17,278
bit of confusion the last couple of

529
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,640
weeks because the city of weisbart

530
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:23,240
together with other cities announced

531
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:27,080
that they will apply for model projects

532
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:29,038
um without a new law defining that uh

533
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:34,119
the government in the first first place

534
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:36,440
said um we um want a new law we want

535
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:41,558
these uh these aspects being being

536
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:44,080
covered uh and um you need to have a an

537
00:25:41,558 --> 00:25:48,038
Institutional a legal framework for for

538
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:50,000
model projects like the Switzerland does

539
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:51,798
and with the framework in place you

540
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,880
can't have model projects in in my

541
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:56,359
opinion um but um let's see how they how

542
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,278
they will how they will do it this

543
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:01,678
situation will be clear will develop

544
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:05,759
will show will turn out in the next

545
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:08,640
couple of months three to four month I

546
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:11,599
guess uh but as we saw in the

547
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,440
Netherlands and in Switzerland the the

548
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:16,398
the the phase from the first idea of a

549
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,759
model project to really implementation

550
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:21,918
to the real implementation of the model

551
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:23,558
project took five years so we are far

552
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,200
away from from implementing model

553
00:26:23,558 --> 00:26:29,158
projects even if we get a new law uh and

554
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:32,640
a proper uh framework which implements

555
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:35,520
that um yeah but it's cannabis it's

556
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,200
never be uh boring and always something

557
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,839
to

558
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,720
do okay medical

559
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,398
cannabis I think I have 26 minutes we

560
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,519
have Peter homberg this afternoon

561
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:50,119
talking about Metal cannabis uh I think

562
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:54,639
I will skip that and uh

563
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:57,119
uh I'm open for questions yeah takeaways

564
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,399
CBD Market stays complicated no real

565
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,798
changes new legal products seeds and

566
00:26:59,398 --> 00:27:03,839
clones and medical has a lots of

567
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:07,398
potential we see we

568
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:10,480
saw uh skyrocketing prescription numbers

569
00:27:07,398 --> 00:27:13,398
uh skyrocketing import volumes uh at the

570
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,720
end of the year I would be surprised uh

571
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,959
that what kind of numbers what what

572
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,480
number of tons we will have been

573
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,360
imported and how many patients we will

574
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,519
have in in Germany so let's see thank

575
