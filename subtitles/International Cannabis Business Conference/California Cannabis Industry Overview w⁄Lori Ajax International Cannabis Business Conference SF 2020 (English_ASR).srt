1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
thanks for joining us Lori thanks for

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,640
having me hi everybody

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,019
gosh what a year it's been I feel like

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:09,209
we were just here last year but it's

5
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:12,779
it's also been really long has been a

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,269
long year and a long January 2020

7
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:17,399
well we got to go fast and there's a lot

8
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,618
to cover it's a big state so let's just

9
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:22,070
dig right in what are some of the top

10
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:24,629
2020 borough of cannabis control

11
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,179
regulatory changes to expect I'm seen

12
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:28,559
emergency rules about QR codes I'm

13
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:30,448
wondering if there's anything going to

14
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,368
be new and lab testing or coming for

15
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,230
retailers or distributors and certainly

16
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:37,079
I'm hearing a lot about metric although

17
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:40,078
that might be on the DFA side right so

18
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,899
as most of you know we just released our

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,350
emergency regs for the QR code require

20
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,239
retailers to post their QR code to help

21
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,559
consumers make informed decisions to

22
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,808
make sure they know they're going to

23
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:54,089
license retail shop so that just got

24
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:56,308
released we of course had some

25
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,399
legislation that was passed last year so

26
00:00:56,308 --> 00:01:02,570
we are looking at SB 34 the compassion

27
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,250
care we had to make some changes in

28
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,750
metric in order to accommodate that and

29
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,629
all three licensing authorities are

30
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,489
working on regulations so that's going

31
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:14,759
to give a folks in the supply chain the

32
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:18,469
ability to donate cannabis to to folks

33
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,939
that yeah that really need it and so

34
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:23,429
that's coming up really soon so that's

35
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:25,649
pretty exciting and then we've been

36
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,720
working on a variety of changes so it

37
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,100
really encompasses a lot but a lot of

38
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:33,150
cleanup changes looking at the three

39
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:34,949
licensing authorities over the last

40
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,090
couple of years you know some people

41
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,359
have pointed out there's some

42
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,670
inconsistencies so what for example man

43
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,640
you know CD pH is written doesn't really

44
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,680
work when it gets down to distribution

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,859
so a lot of that cleanup we're looking

46
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,868
at so I think you're gonna see a lot of

47
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,030
things coming down more you know there's

48
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:56,188
a lot of confusion on ownership I think

49
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,599
how the Bureau looks at ownership is

50
00:01:56,188 --> 00:01:59,398
slightly different than the other two

51
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,750
and so all that needs to be cleaned up

52
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,340
because if you're gonna apply for a

53
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,590
license it should be fairly consistent

54
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:10,378
between the three licensing authorities

55
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:12,120
what legislation is Bureau of the Bureau

56
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:13,590
of cannabis control watching in 22

57
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,959
you know the governor just released his

58
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,539
budget package and talked about a little

59
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,509
bit of agency consolidation potentially

60
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:23,219
potentially moving streamlining taxes

61
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:24,989
what are you watching what salient in

62
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:26,310
this new year well I think there's a

63
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:28,349
couple of things obviously the

64
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,479
streamlining of taxes I think that's

65
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:32,310
important to everybody even when we look

66
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,959
at you know where the point a collection

67
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,090
is going to be that may change things

68
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,009
for the bureau but I think you're

69
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:45,120
looking at things like trade samples may

70
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:48,149
pop up again so I think we'll be

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,370
watching things like that maybe what's

72
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,409
even happening on the hemp front you

73
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,629
know does that fall under you know a

74
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:57,299
regulatory structure and then of course

75
00:02:54,628 --> 00:03:00,090
we will be watching how things develop

76
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:02,879
with consolidation that's probably a big

77
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,739
one right yeah just to jump off on

78
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,479
consolidation is there a timeline around

79
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,009
that at all is this a fast-moving thing

80
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,810
or a slow-moving thing and I mean that's

81
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:12,899
all relative to the speed of government

82
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,420
in general all right I think you are

83
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,269
gonna see some changes fairly quickly

84
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:20,129
when it comes to really just starting to

85
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:21,329
have a plan of what consolidation is

86
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:23,430
going to look like and what that

87
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:25,739
leadership's gonna look like so we're

88
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,689
all you know reporting to the same chain

89
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,359
of command I think what's going to take

90
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:33,419
probably anywhere from 12 to 18 months

91
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:35,090
is really we all have we all are located

92
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:37,169
in different facilities and really

93
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,239
geographically getting everybody in one

94
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:41,939
place or deciding where people are gonna

95
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,819
be I think that does take some time

96
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:47,159
I think anything I mean depending I you

97
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:49,108
know at at the state level I don't know

98
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:52,198
what's what you consider quick to what

99
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:53,969
we consider quick but I in my eye you

100
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,440
know if we get this done in the next 18

101
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:57,150
months I think that's that's a pretty

102
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,189
huge accomplishment and that's fairly

103
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,639
quick and I think the important thing is

104
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:04,949
is that the industry it's smooth with

105
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,889
the industry I mean there's gonna be a

106
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:09,510
lot of work to do within but as long it

107
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:11,609
we need to still be making sure we're

108
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:13,259
getting those license applications out

109
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:15,959
that we're answering your question so

110
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:19,189
hopefully as quick as we're moving the

111
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,959
industry isn't affected by it too much

112
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:23,490
what are some of your success metrics or

113
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,220
goals for 2020 at the

114
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:29,400
cannabis control wow that seems a change

115
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,259
every year so well I'm gonna tell you I

116
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:33,568
mean it's pretty exciting I mean for us

117
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:35,639
it's always the priority is making sure

118
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:37,889
people that are qualified to have a

119
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,569
license and want a license we get them

120
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:42,120
licensed I mean the more people we can

121
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:45,300
get licensed working with the local

122
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,660
jurisdictions to educate them making

123
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,220
sure we're helping them to approve some

124
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,960
of these licenses and then you know

125
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,460
enforcement I think for the next couple

126
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:58,439
of years is going to be a big priority

127
00:04:53,459 --> 00:05:00,408
and making sure we're still have our you

128
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:03,629
know foot on the pedal of going after

129
00:05:00,408 --> 00:05:05,788
unlicensed activity across the state

130
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:09,598
obviously consolidation is gonna be a

131
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:13,168
big priority for us and you know I think

132
00:05:09,598 --> 00:05:15,180
it's a great opportunity I think the

133
00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:18,299
fact that we're all gonna be one agency

134
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:20,668
is it just makes sense and I think in a

135
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,788
lot of ways it makes its combining all

136
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:26,579
of our priorities I think it's gonna be

137
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:28,439
in a lot of ways for the folks out in

138
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:30,120
the audience that works with California

139
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:33,149
it's gonna be really nice when you can

140
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,090
go to one place for your license search

141
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:39,319
to see who has a license one place to

142
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:42,589
apply for a license I think I mean us

143
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:45,509
streamlining that process and making it

144
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:46,948
more business friendly for the consumer

145
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:49,439
to apply for a license and get

146
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:51,389
information I think that is gonna be the

147
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,620
goal for this year to make sure we do

148
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:54,870
that right because I think it's

149
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,090
important we do that right is the BCC

150
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,860
fully staffed up how staffing looking

151
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:01,258
this year I know we got annual licensing

152
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,060
going on and these are two separate

153
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,490
questions but what hiccups can people

154
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,709
avoid common hiccups can they avoid any

155
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:11,280
annual licensure yeah so we're we're

156
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:13,198
we're getting we've staffed up a lot you

157
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:16,258
know within the bureau we're close to a

158
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,530
hundred employees we are we are almost

159
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:21,870
fully staffed on our licensing and

160
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:26,848
really probably the biggest hiccup we

161
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:29,129
find with people is just a lot of just

162
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:31,110
just things like that when we reach out

163
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:33,060
to folks a lot of times it takes time to

164
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,550
get things back but I think a lot of

165
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,410
people have trouble with the application

166
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,000
maybe what they need to do

167
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,700
maybe not understanding what they need

168
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,740
for like providing us and I think the

169
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:46,289
biggest thing I can say is like please

170
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,910
reach out to us have that everybody here

171
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,650
if you have a application with the

172
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,110
bureau you're assigned a licensing

173
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:53,939
analyst to work one-on-one with you with

174
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,980
your application if you're having

175
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:58,019
trouble with that application we want to

176
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,629
know we want to walk you through it and

177
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:02,399
so I think instead of like anything else

178
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,199
when sometimes you don't understand what

179
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,019
you need to do you tend to put that off

180
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,209
oh yeah we all do that I do that and I

181
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:11,490
think it's like just let you know

182
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:13,709
whatever we need to do to work through

183
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:16,769
that application the good news is is

184
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:18,810
that for the annual application most of

185
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:20,549
you are getting Provisionals and a lot

186
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:23,100
of times we can get those Provisionals

187
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,259
out and then we can slowly work with you

188
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,600
to get those annual requirements so I

189
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:29,670
think it's not gonna keep you from doing

190
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,590
business so I would always encourage you

191
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:33,689
whatever we need for that provisional

192
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:35,339
get that to us first so we can get you

193
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:38,399
in a provisional and then we can work on

194
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:39,899
all the rest is there a BCC help phone

195
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,649
line have you considered doing one of

196
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:46,109
those yes that's a good point so we do

197
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:48,239
have a phone line that can reach

198
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,830
directly to our licensing people and you

199
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,889
know you're gonna ask me for it right

200
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:55,769
now and I'll get you well we'll get you

201
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:59,490
it but it's more to your point anyone

202
00:07:55,769 --> 00:08:07,529
800 BC yeah we're we yeah that's what we

203
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:10,319
do need that yes we we do have that

204
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:12,239
number but I think I like your idea we

205
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,060
need like that vanity number so it's

206
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,340
easy to get a hold of us and with more

207
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,459
people it allows us to be more

208
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:22,469
accessible and I think we're trying to

209
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:24,750
you know not everybody wants to be

210
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,280
communicated by phone someone email but

211
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,459
somewhat text so I think you're gonna

212
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:32,218
see us exploring more of hey how maybe

213
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:35,218
asking you on the application how do you

214
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:36,570
prefer let's communicate to you so we're

215
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,849
making some changes to the application

216
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,410
where we're gonna ask those questions so

217
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:43,229
then we know what your preferred method

218
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:46,409
of communication is I know it's crazy it

219
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:48,389
is but I think it's good we're also

220
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:50,649
looking at doing a lot more in the

221
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:53,318
application process putting little help

222
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:55,419
says we find that there's a lot of

223
00:08:53,318 --> 00:08:56,919
things we can head off by just putting

224
00:08:55,419 --> 00:09:00,669
those things and so we're really looking

225
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:02,558
at how that application is online and

226
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:04,568
trying to make some really needed

227
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:06,730
changes to it to make it easier for you

228
00:09:04,568 --> 00:09:10,110
so you don't have to call us up that you

229
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,110
got the answer right there

230
00:09:13,438 --> 00:09:17,980
how is your email response times I

231
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:19,929
gotten a couple social media questions

232
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:23,199
about like I'm having trouble getting an

233
00:09:19,928 --> 00:09:25,928
email response back yeah you know I you

234
00:09:23,198 --> 00:09:28,149
know I could I think I'm gonna say we

235
00:09:25,928 --> 00:09:30,308
are we're really responsive especially

236
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:34,178
on the the questions that we answer on a

237
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:36,818
regular basis we those are we got those

238
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:39,879
right we even have a database that we

239
00:09:36,818 --> 00:09:41,409
house those on our website which is your

240
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,928
questions answer it's a searchable

241
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:47,198
database I always say on some of the

242
00:09:43,928 --> 00:09:50,470
questions likes unique business models

243
00:09:47,198 --> 00:09:53,528
that we get those do sometimes take

244
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:56,050
longer right because we don't know the

245
00:09:53,528 --> 00:09:58,269
answer and we are and sometimes we have

246
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:59,979
to contact public health and food mad

247
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:03,459
because it's sometimes it involves all

248
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:05,860
three and so we do just so you know we

249
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:07,599
meet every week to talk about email

250
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:13,419
questions we're not sure how to deal

251
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:16,269
with and have a controlled trimmer

252
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:17,979
agency doesn't have any pot but anyway

253
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:22,629
that's my job you guys have creative

254
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:25,959
questions - there's like ice cream

255
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:29,438
trucks well there's all sorts of things

256
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:31,479
you guys have great ideas and we got to

257
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:33,370
keep up with all those great ideas one

258
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,839
question people have is what is the

259
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,100
future of lounges

260
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:37,600
there's certainly a number of

261
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:42,730
consumption lounges there tend to be

262
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:45,459
locally licensed and the BCC is yeah

263
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:49,659
really lounges is is more of a local

264
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:52,659
jurisdiction issue and we that is really

265
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:54,610
if the locals allow a lounge most of the

266
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:57,068
time there's not gonna be an issue with

267
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:59,889
the BCC unless it's violating some sort

268
00:10:57,068 --> 00:11:01,928
of regs but so far we haven't had any

269
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:03,310
issues with the the social consumption

270
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,929
lounges that have been issued

271
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:06,339
there could be some out there that we

272
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:09,429
don't know about that we could have an

273
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:12,790
issue with but but yeah that's more at

274
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:14,859
the local level and so yeah you know one

275
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:17,110
thing you guys do have is eighty-five

276
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:21,190
events like events licensees this year

277
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:22,419
can you speak to that licensing space it

278
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,650
seems like there's a lot of them as it

279
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:26,679
means we're gonna have a lot of events

280
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:28,600
this year what's your read on the event

281
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:31,299
this awesome events license that no

282
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,820
other state has and California cannabis

283
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:38,309
tourism in general well I just was at a

284
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,310
reason I understand Michigan sort of

285
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:50,279
they took what we did you know I I feel

286
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:52,838
like I hope that we get a lot more event

287
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:54,850
temporary events coming up we had some

288
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:56,610
really big ones last year you know we

289
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,810
have had Emerald cup we've also had

290
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:01,180
grasslands which was under council it

291
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:05,289
was huge and it really went off with

292
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:07,870
with no issues at all and so I think we

293
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:10,240
you know if you go back to years when

294
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:13,060
the statute only allowed you to have

295
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,759
temporary events on on fairgrounds or

296
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:18,250
district agricultural places and then

297
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,230
that got changed to allow for it could

298
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,179
be anywhere where the jurisdiction

299
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,750
expressly approved I think we thought

300
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:27,579
there'd be a lot more event licenses and

301
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,649
I don't know that we've seen that and I

302
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,600
think the locals are really trying to

303
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:34,000
figure out where the best place to have

304
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,129
these things so I really am optimistic

305
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,480
that we're gonna have a lot more of

306
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:43,389
these this year what do you tell people

307
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,879
who ask I mean so much of this stuff is

308
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:47,559
local what's the best way to affect

309
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:50,620
local change that you've seen do you

310
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:53,259
have any stories that stick in your mind

311
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,269
where locals really changed their

312
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:57,610
environment I think of people running

313
00:12:55,269 --> 00:13:00,759
referendums or taking city council seats

314
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:03,430
I mentioned you know that last year yeah

315
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:06,069
I mean I think all of that at the local

316
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:10,629
level has to come from the constituents

317
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:13,510
of that jurisdiction and really engaging

318
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:15,429
with the local politicians though that

319
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:16,960
that that's a full that could almost be

320
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:18,909
a full-time job

321
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:23,019
you know that you have to be on top of

322
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:26,199
that and so I think also though it's a

323
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:28,149
lot has to do with their also struggling

324
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,730
with resources they have a lot of other

325
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:31,509
issues they're dealing with in their

326
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:33,670
jurisdiction whether you know

327
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:36,309
homelessness and housing and all those

328
00:13:33,669 --> 00:13:39,099
things so I think the more you can keep

329
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:42,039
them informed about what's going on with

330
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:45,129
cannabis and the statutes and and just

331
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:48,399
keeping them educated is also you know a

332
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:50,409
really valuable thing and if you know of

333
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,079
like a local jurisdiction that seems to

334
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:55,419
want to do cannabis regulation but maybe

335
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:58,300
they don't know where the start we're

336
00:13:55,419 --> 00:14:00,490
happy to Steve we know will step in and

337
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:02,229
send people there and and really talk

338
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,700
with them about it because you know we

339
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,129
want to make sure they get really good

340
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,930
information so if you think there's a

341
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:09,279
jurisdiction out there that's struggling

342
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:10,929
that you think would be valuable for us

343
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,089
to talk to we're happy to do that as

344
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:14,500
well I saw for the first time that the

345
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:16,690
League of California cities this

346
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,250
Association of California cities that

347
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,410
does a lot of lobbying they not only

348
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,909
have model band ordinances on their

349
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:24,579
website but for the first time they have

350
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:25,839
actual model dispensary ordinances and

351
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,030
it struck me that the lack of

352
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:31,060
institutional support over these years

353
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:32,860
has left these bewildered citizens who

354
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:35,829
you know are in charge of their locality

355
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:38,110
kind of gun-shy about moving forward on

356
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,790
a lot of this stuff do you see any more

357
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,409
institutional support emerging to

358
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:43,029
support locals who again remained the

359
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:44,620
wildered and outgunned in terms of the

360
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:48,669
legal innovation required to do a local

361
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:50,230
ordinance well I think you're seeing you

362
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:53,019
know one of the things we did do last

363
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:55,870
year is released the local social equity

364
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:59,829
grants we award ten million dollars to

365
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:04,779
ten jurisdiction we there's now go-biz

366
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:07,570
just announced another round of yeah

367
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:11,049
there's close to thirty million and

368
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:13,270
they're they're also going to be giving

369
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:15,129
out grants to local jurisdictions and

370
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:18,189
intend to do a social equity program so

371
00:15:15,129 --> 00:15:19,299
I think that's really going to really

372
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,980
you're gonna I think you're gonna see

373
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:22,870
more local jurisdiction looking at

374
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,940
cannabis regulation look at in social

375
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:28,570
equity programs so I think you're gonna

376
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,800
see some of that changing also you know

377
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,240
because we get

378
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:33,729
so many questions from the local

379
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,080
jurisdiction I think people if you're

380
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:37,149
not from California

381
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,889
you forget we have over 500 different

382
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:42,039
cities and counties that we have to

383
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:44,559
interact with it's it's it's huge and

384
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:46,120
country yeah and we're finding locals

385
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,609
are asking more questions we're

386
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,578
expanding we have a local liaison unit

387
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:53,589
and their sole responsibility is just to

388
00:15:51,578 --> 00:15:57,009
work with that local jurisdiction answer

389
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:59,290
their questions we having a dedicated

390
00:15:57,009 --> 00:16:02,289
phone line so they're not waiting for

391
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:04,599
answers because we want them to get

392
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:06,909
answers so they can answer you as well

393
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,129
so I think you're gonna see hopefully

394
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:11,078
I'm trying to be optimistic that that's

395
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:13,450
gonna change this year how many stores

396
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:15,219
do you think California new ones well

397
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:17,079
well the state might license this year

398
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,910
well it's actually state and local I see

399
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:21,129
the licensee numbers come out every week

400
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:23,769
I see new stores opening in places that

401
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:25,088
have never had them I see cannabis

402
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:26,500
commerce coming to places that never

403
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:28,300
even considered medical cannabis

404
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,009
commerce you know talking to some

405
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:31,870
experts like Amanda where at counter

406
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:33,819
regs we're guessing that maybe two or

407
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:36,310
three hundred more stores might join the

408
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:39,010
mix this year what do you see in that

409
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:41,469
tempo I think that way I'm hoping that

410
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:43,990
happens I think when you look at our

411
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:46,600
population and a number of retailers I

412
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:49,419
mean I mean really it's you know with

413
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:52,659
the number of yeah I mean we want people

414
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:54,759
to have access to legal cannabis and you

415
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:56,799
can't do that when you have pockets of

416
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:58,929
the state where people can't access

417
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:02,199
legal cannabis unless they have to drive

418
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:04,539
several hours so we want as a state

419
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,970
right we want them to be able to access

420
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:08,558
places that have their cannabis tested

421
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,600
to make sure they're they're you know

422
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:13,568
paying their taxes their packaging and

423
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:17,619
labeling and so it's really I'm hopeful

424
00:17:13,568 --> 00:17:19,328
to see increased access at the retail

425
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:21,639
level I think that's good for everybody

426
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:24,698
it's good for your distributors and

427
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,829
retailers right now right right and I'm

428
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:29,110
seeing again like there's 500 plus

429
00:17:26,828 --> 00:17:30,759
cities or counties even if a hundred of

430
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:32,639
them just do one or two stores for the

431
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:35,440
first time it makes a measurable impact

432
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,480
how many we have going right now when

433
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,900
you look back at 2019 what do you

434
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,940
consider the biggest wins of last year I

435
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,450
don't recall you were telling LA Times

436
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,548
that

437
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,950
not a single confirmed case of exclusive

438
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:51,548
use of a licensed or vape product

439
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:53,380
associated with injuries last year but

440
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:55,480
yeah when you when the clock struck

441
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,970
midnight what were you happy that you

442
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:01,089
know you got done last year well I

443
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:03,639
obviously the equity grants getting out

444
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:06,148
there and awarding grants that's that's

445
00:18:03,638 --> 00:18:08,349
pretty incredible and when you look as

446
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:09,668
California's the leader on that and I

447
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:12,308
think you're some watching other states

448
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:14,980
take notice of that so I think that was

449
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:17,950
a huge thing enforcement I increased our

450
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:20,409
our enforcement efforts with starting

451
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,240
different techniques we increased how

452
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:24,490
many search warrants we're serving on

453
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,190
unlicensed places we're getting better

454
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,480
at our tactics of keeping them close to

455
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,880
so we're not going in and they're

456
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,159
opening up the next day but we looked at

457
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,710
tactics like we sent landlord letters

458
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:39,610
basically warning the property owner if

459
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:41,009
you're allowing your tenant to continue

460
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:44,949
doing this we're going to take action

461
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:47,379
against you I mean so all those trying

462
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,778
to find different tactics and different

463
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:52,659
things to go after the unlicensed market

464
00:18:49,778 --> 00:18:54,220
and then I you know really stepping up

465
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:56,049
our public awareness campaign that's

466
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,990
probably been the biggest thing for us

467
00:18:56,048 --> 00:19:02,259
is really trying to get the word out

468
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:05,079
there to consumers to try to change

469
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:07,240
those habits to encourage them to go to

470
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:10,898
the legal market and why it's important

471
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:13,480
to go to the legal market and and the

472
00:19:10,898 --> 00:19:15,278
and the QR code I mean honestly I I

473
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:19,028
think we've been just trying to attack

474
00:19:15,278 --> 00:19:20,409
it at all fronts what work do you see is

475
00:19:19,028 --> 00:19:22,778
left undone I think we've touched on a

476
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:24,940
lot of it and in this talk so far but is

477
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:27,099
it just gonna be consolidation this year

478
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,740
streamlining licensing what are what

479
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:33,699
what is the big priorities well

480
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:35,620
obviously you know our stakeholders are

481
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,630
always gonna be a priority we want to

482
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:40,089
make Shan I said this earlier and I

483
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:43,899
can't say it enough I mean you want us

484
00:19:40,089 --> 00:19:46,119
to be very nimble when it comes to

485
00:19:43,898 --> 00:19:48,009
processing your license applications and

486
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:50,379
getting you licensed and making sure

487
00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:52,628
we're responsive to you but also on the

488
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,940
same time we have to make sure we have

489
00:19:52,628 --> 00:19:56,289
the infrastructure to support that so

490
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,570
continue to stay

491
00:19:56,289 --> 00:20:03,220
but consolidations is a big part of that

492
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:05,439
but I'm pretty confident we can you know

493
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:08,170
we can get that done and streamlining

494
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,480
that I'm looking forward to you know

495
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:12,250
making sure that when you go to a web

496
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,110
you know you go to one website for all

497
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:16,779
of us I mean who wants to go to three

498
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:18,729
separate licensing websites to try to

499
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:20,559
figure out what you need to do so those

500
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,849
are some simple things we can do over

501
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,009
the next few months that I think is

502
00:20:21,849 --> 00:20:25,779
gonna make your lives a lot easier

503
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:28,180
what is your read on the overall

504
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:30,789
industry health certainly there's been

505
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:33,100
some layoffs and some people who have

506
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:34,389
been moaning into the high tax and

507
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:36,969
regulation environment here in

508
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:39,430
California or the lows the slow speed of

509
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,870
local implementation when you look at

510
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:43,029
the dashboard for the California

511
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:44,409
cannabis industry the legal side what is

512
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:47,680
that what is that dashboard reading to

513
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:49,930
you you know I am always gonna I always

514
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:54,759
take I feel like we're speed-dating

515
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:58,029
right now so quickly I I'm always gonna

516
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:59,829
be optimistic because what happens I

517
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:02,710
don't know it I'll be honest with

518
00:20:59,829 --> 00:21:05,589
cannabis it surprises me every day what

519
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:09,009
I think I know like two months ago I'm

520
00:21:05,589 --> 00:21:11,589
like oh gosh I you know yeah it changes

521
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:13,869
and and so you gotta meet you gotta roll

522
00:21:11,589 --> 00:21:17,529
with the punches so I'm I'm optimistic

523
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:20,469
that things are gonna look up and and I

524
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:23,079
think as long as you're engaged and you

525
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:25,390
keep us and making sure I'm going to say

526
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:27,970
if I if I ever get asked by any other

527
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:30,820
state what's the most important thing it

528
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:33,309
is making sure you're working with your

529
00:21:30,819 --> 00:21:35,319
stakeholders you're listening to your

530
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:37,869
stakeholder I sort of say you got to

531
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:40,269
keep your egos in check as regulators

532
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:42,309
right a lot of times we need to just

533
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:44,470
listen we don't need to always be the

534
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:46,629
ones talking and as long as we have a

535
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,809
relationship where there's that mutual

536
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:51,820
respect I think we can accomplish a lot

537
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,980
of things over the next year a couple

538
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:55,960
more questions one I don't see Los

539
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:58,390
Angeles adding any new stores this year

540
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:01,000
in the city limits due to issues around

541
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:04,060
licensure there and who gets them and

542
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,240
the speed of rollout there is the City

543
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:09,609
of LA which is the biggest market in

544
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,920
California and arguably the world

545
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:14,769
where is the BCC going to help them or

546
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:17,048
is that really on them to sort out you

547
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:19,690
stand ready to issue the licenses to who

548
00:22:17,048 --> 00:22:22,869
they license well we stand ready but at

549
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:24,910
the same time you know they have a they

550
00:22:22,869 --> 00:22:26,739
they don't have an easy process to get

551
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,540
through and so we're always there to

552
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:32,349
help them they're one of our equity

553
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:34,000
grant recipients and so we're gonna

554
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:35,469
start and and one of the other things

555
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,679
you're going to start seeing is us going

556
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:40,990
around the state looking at doing

557
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:43,809
workshops licensing workshops to work

558
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:46,990
with the local jurisdictions and to help

559
00:22:43,808 --> 00:22:48,819
our applicants navigate having the

560
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,140
locals there to help them navigate the

561
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:52,659
local process than having the state

562
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:54,940
there to have applicants navigate the

563
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,860
state process so as we see some of these

564
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,419
equity grants getting awarded we're

565
00:22:56,859 --> 00:22:59,589
gonna start stepping in and doing these

566
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:01,030
workshops and I think it's gonna be

567
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:03,789
helpful to a lot of the local

568
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:06,940
jurisdictions so I you know we're there

569
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:09,308
for any of the locals I don't I don't

570
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:12,669
feel I'm not one to just stand back and

571
00:23:09,308 --> 00:23:14,678
wait I think it's you know up to us to

572
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:18,429
make sure to provide any resources that

573
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:20,290
we have that would assist them in LA a

574
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:22,120
lot of Angelenos are confused as to

575
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:23,740
what's a licensed store and what's not a

576
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:25,779
licensed store there's a long history of

577
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:28,210
unlicensed operators there and there's

578
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:30,009
very few licensed ones the Bureau of

579
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:31,960
cannabis control has a licensee lookup

580
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:33,609
tool on its website do you know how

581
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,069
effective that is is it working our

582
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:38,289
consumers going there to disambiguate a

583
00:23:36,069 --> 00:23:39,909
licensed or from an unlicensed one what

584
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:41,829
more do you want to do to make sure

585
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:43,720
people know the difference

586
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:45,099
considering that 80 90 percent of them

587
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,329
is their first time ever walking into a

588
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:48,969
Spencer E they don't even know what to

589
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:50,918
expect right so with our public

590
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,660
awareness campaign we did change the

591
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:56,679
name of our license to church so it's

592
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:58,990
see a pot check comm and hopefully

593
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:06,000
people like it's a lot easier than

594
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:08,380
putting BCC CAA correct and so I think

595
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,599
we are gonna make some more improvements

596
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,820
to our licensing search because you know

597
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:16,119
that we don't we you can't search by DBA

598
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:17,740
right now and so a lot of you don't know

599
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:19,928
the legal name or and you may not even

600
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:23,109
know the license number so but then

601
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:25,778
again that QR code is also important so

602
00:24:23,109 --> 00:24:27,369
we're requiring retailers they get a QR

603
00:24:25,778 --> 00:24:29,259
code when they're issued their license

604
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:31,268
they can post it out in front of the

605
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:33,129
store and so if you're a consumer you

606
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:35,200
can just take your camera take you know

607
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:37,120
scan it and it'll tell you all the

608
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,649
information you need about that licensee

609
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:41,139
the owners whether it's an active

610
00:24:38,648 --> 00:24:42,639
license and so we're hoping that helps

611
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,740
consumers because they can make that

612
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,960
decision prior to going into the store

613
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:48,669
because you know you always have to post

614
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,048
your license inside the store but who

615
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:56,528
wants to go in there and say hey I feel

616
00:24:53,048 --> 00:24:59,769
super intimidated about this guy where's

617
00:24:56,528 --> 00:25:01,569
your license like well but I think more

618
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:04,028
improvements to our license searches to

619
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:06,099
make it that much easier if you make

620
00:25:04,028 --> 00:25:09,490
things hard people aren't gonna use it

621
00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:11,138
so I think it it's good what we have but

622
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:14,649
it can be better

623
00:25:11,138 --> 00:25:16,869
similarly similarly to that we have this

624
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:19,538
legacy of a lot of medical marijuana

625
00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:22,000
products in the state and a continued

626
00:25:19,538 --> 00:25:23,679
issue with counterfeit products at these

627
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,759
dispensaries you're rating them and

628
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,460
picking them up and seeing the

629
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:29,500
counterfeits is there anything on bcc's

630
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:31,778
radar about battling the issue of

631
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,308
counterfeits empowering consumers to be

632
00:25:31,778 --> 00:25:35,138
able to tell the difference I get a lot

633
00:25:33,308 --> 00:25:37,210
of people who go I don't I don't know

634
00:25:35,138 --> 00:25:40,388
where this vape cards from and I don't

635
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:42,278
know how to tell right in in it is even

636
00:25:40,388 --> 00:25:44,619
difficult for us to tell what the

637
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:47,288
difference is consumers are it's hard to

638
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:49,418
tell for us and even you know some of

639
00:25:47,288 --> 00:25:51,129
our you know manufacturers I think we're

640
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:53,080
looking at the industry itself

641
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:57,220
especially our manufacturers and stuff

642
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:59,648
how how how can we label things to to

643
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:01,990
help not have so many of these things

644
00:25:59,648 --> 00:26:04,239
counterfeited I mean and it's speaking

645
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:06,159
of the QR code we already having to see

646
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,990
we're seeing labs where they're saying

647
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,539
their certificate of analysis are being

648
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:13,269
counterfeited right and so now we're

649
00:26:10,538 --> 00:26:15,970
even seeing labs voluntarily doing a QR

650
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:18,519
code on that CoA that eventually gets to

651
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:21,490
that label so you can scan that label it

652
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:24,190
goes right to the CoA so I think the

653
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:26,288
industry's pretty pretty savvy and I

654
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:28,929
think we're looking to work with the

655
00:26:26,288 --> 00:26:30,759
industry to help us with how do we deal

656
00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:33,070
with all these counterfeit products and

657
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:35,138
I think that's something that's that's a

658
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:36,158
big thing for this next year two more

659
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:39,459
and then we'll

660
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,230
yeah we did it first one is how is there

661
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:43,240
a better way to verify Bureau of

662
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:45,730
cannabis control employees when they do

663
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,130
staff snap inspections some licensees

664
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:50,140
have wondered is this a real BCC guy or

665
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:52,778
is this someone trying to roll me

666
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:54,669
because people have gotten rolled in by

667
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:57,490
individuals who are you know

668
00:26:54,669 --> 00:27:00,009
masquerading as officials now yeah and

669
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:02,259
we get people that that you know they

670
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:04,658
have fake websites that say the Bureau

671
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:06,609
of cannabis oh yeah we've seen that and

672
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:08,850
we try to shut those down so there's all

673
00:27:06,609 --> 00:27:12,219
sorts of things so if our folks go out

674
00:27:08,849 --> 00:27:14,648
to a licensed inspection they are

675
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:18,370
wearing shirts that identify themselves

676
00:27:14,648 --> 00:27:22,000
they also have identification that they

677
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:24,278
are required to show you if asked and I

678
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,579
have they have to have business cards so

679
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:31,179
if there's ever something like something

680
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:34,778
doesn't seem right it doesn't feel right

681
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:37,149
then we would say hey who can we you can

682
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:40,509
just call us to verify it and we will be

683
00:27:37,148 --> 00:27:43,000
happy to take that call but our guys are

684
00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:46,058
very professional they're usually going

685
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,880
to come out and at least pairs and so

686
00:27:46,058 --> 00:27:54,398
you ask them for their ID ask them for

687
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:56,409
their business card I don't know where

688
00:27:54,398 --> 00:28:01,119
with the QR code go to their wrist

689
00:27:56,409 --> 00:28:03,490
ya know lastly two thirds of California

690
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:05,469
remains a banned town so to speak but

691
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:06,700
delivery can serve pretty much every

692
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:08,380
corner of the state at least the next

693
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,940
day some of these delivery services is

694
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,950
there anything on the horizon for

695
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,240
delivery in 2020 I know you guys don't

696
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:15,278
get involved with the lawsuit that's

697
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,740
ongoing although I will say it doesn't

698
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,390
seem like it holds much legal water but

699
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:23,470
is there any delivery needs we need to

700
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:27,549
know about thanks for the support so

701
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:29,259
when it comes to delivery the that we

702
00:28:27,548 --> 00:28:31,480
have a regulation that says if you're

703
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:33,788
licensed by the Bureau and and you can

704
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:38,169
for delivery that you can deliver any to

705
00:28:33,788 --> 00:28:40,599
anywhere in California we are being sued

706
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:42,159
on that and I know David's gonna be

707
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:43,990
upset with me but because there's a

708
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,850
lawsuit I'm really not allowed to

709
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:47,710
comment on delay

710
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:49,449
so just logistics of delivery those

711
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:52,269
delivery licenses are out those guys are

712
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:55,269
rolling any delivery regs to note today

713
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:56,888
none to note today okay if you have some

714
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:59,349
suggestions don't worry

715
00:28:56,888 --> 00:29:00,908
yeah like I think people want to lessen

716
00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:02,980
the regulation that I add more I guess

717
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:05,740
that's the one suggestions from everyone

718
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,450
you know lastly the continuing theme I

719
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:10,769
hear from people is how do we make

720
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:13,899
license easier how can you help us in

721
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:16,419
2020 the industry says they want me to

722
00:29:13,898 --> 00:29:17,918
ask you that so that's the last sort of

723
00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:22,000
question to you is like are we gonna

724
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:25,840
make licensing easier will you help well

725
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,630
that's a great question I think yes we

726
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:30,879
can make licensing easier is there

727
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:34,450
certain things that may always be

728
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,669
required that folks don't like yes cuz

729
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:39,580
that's in the statute so some things is

730
00:29:36,669 --> 00:29:43,538
beyond our control we certainly being

731
00:29:39,579 --> 00:29:46,869
responsive making things clear making

732
00:29:43,538 --> 00:29:51,879
sure we clear up confusion is always a

733
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:53,678
top priority for us and we we do want to

734
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,750
help and I know that sound it sounds

735
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:59,710
corny to say cuz you're always like yeah

736
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:02,558
right but truly we don't want this to be

737
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:04,899
an arduous process for you and I do feel

738
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:08,528
like for a lot of you it does seem that

739
00:30:04,898 --> 00:30:11,888
way well it is that not seem it is that

740
00:30:08,528 --> 00:30:13,960
way and so I think we are like I told

741
00:30:11,888 --> 00:30:16,750
you we're looking at ways on even our

742
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,639
ways that we can be more flexible as

743
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:20,888
well I think the last couple of years

744
00:30:18,638 --> 00:30:23,949
there there was a tendency like we're

745
00:30:20,888 --> 00:30:26,469
just following everything to the tee and

746
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:30,370
I think the the greatest thing that we

747
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:32,798
could do is provide more flexibility in

748
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:35,219
the in especially when we're seen as

749
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:38,048
businesses change in and so I think

750
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:40,000
providing allowing that would be helpful

751
00:30:38,048 --> 00:30:41,710
over the next year well you got a hard

752
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,028
think this job thank you for getting up

753
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,710
every morning and doing it thanks for

754
