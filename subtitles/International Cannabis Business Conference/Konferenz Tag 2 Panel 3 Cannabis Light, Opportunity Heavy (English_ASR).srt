00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,480
keep doing what you're doing but like

12
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,579
things are hard they're only going to

13
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,199
get harder and like you know cannabis

14
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:26,278
light Plan B you know what's happening

15
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,800
in Germany

16
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:30,000
really exciting kind of sucks though so

17
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,219
it's like where are the actual

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,359
opportunities in Germany in Europe and

19
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,679
then still globally because everything

20
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,179
kind of sucks if you've been following

21
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,039
the news if not

22
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:40,019
welcome to the party

23
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:41,759
um a little disclaimer I look like a

24
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,920
lawyer sometimes I talk like one I'm not

25
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,500
a lawyer make sure to use good lawyers

26
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,939
in this space good CPAs without them you

27
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,378
will be screwed

28
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:50,579
see even with them you're kind of

29
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:51,960
screwed sometimes and no matter what

30
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,058
they're going to win like they always

31
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,160
get paid win or lose but like without

32
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:58,259
good legal interpretation

33
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,078
or tax understanding of like how things

34
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:02,399
work between countries for where you're

35
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,960
going to get like the best deductions

36
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,879
like you will even if you have the best

37
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,799
business in the world if you don't like

38
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:10,079
plan it correctly or do the tax side

39
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,520
correctly legally you're just screwed so

40
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,260
like don't even do business if you think

41
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,519
you can do it without good lawyers and

42
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,260
tax accountants unless you're going to

43
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:19,079
like sell lemonade outside your house

44
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,299
and I might be offensive I do swear I do

45
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,798
make fun of things but I'm not guessing

46
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,720
this is literally the truth when you

47
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,340
fight the truth you lose so you know

48
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,859
here we go

49
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,200
um been in the space for 16 years

50
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,819
um originally from Wisconsin was in the

51
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,019
military

52
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:35,879
um disabled that that's how I actually

53
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:38,879
got into cannabis went to Colorado 16

54
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:40,920
years ago right place right time medical

55
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,359
had just happened we were the first

56
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,519
state that allowed like commercial

57
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:45,719
medical production we were also the

58
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,239
first state that allowed commercial

59
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:50,280
recreational adult use 21 and older

60
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,379
production we beat California we beat

61
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,700
Washington we beat everybody we were the

62
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,158
guinea pig so I was like right place

63
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,140
right time and really just saw when it

64
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,280
went from like caregivers kind of like

65
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,299
your Club thing that's going to happen

66
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,799
here where it's like you can grow

67
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,960
certain plants for people and like kind

68
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,079
of sell them but not make money to like

69
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,399
oh you can have a gmbh or an LLC a

70
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:09,478
corporation that actually like makes

71
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,180
profit

72
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,920
so been around for a long time started

73
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,920
working in Colorado other states other

74
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,500
countries then by 2015 first German

75
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:20,639
tender here second German tender and all

76
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,199
over the world so like what we've

77
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,519
learned from all these markets is very

78
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:25,738
indicative of what you're going to see

79
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,239
continuing to evolve here I finished my

80
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:29,400
slides five minutes before this so like

81
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,900
it's gonna be really fun what happens

82
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,400
um so yeah like what's the current

83
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,420
status of the industry like I made the

84
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,800
joke the other day like everything's

85
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,419
just great so like there's no need to

86
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,760
even have a conversation right like good

87
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:39,899
job everybody

88
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,759
nothing's [ __ ] great it's actually

89
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,780
horrible it's the worst that it's ever

90
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,719
been

91
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,620
ever so like what do we need to do I

92
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:48,060
kind of made like jokes like

93
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,439
everything's kind of on fire even though

94
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,019
like a lot of people you're talking here

95
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,639
are like really excited they're doing

96
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,680
awesome business some things are doing

97
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,818
crushing Revenue main thing we got to

98
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,620
remember though is like we are still

99
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:00,598
getting medicine to patients which is

100
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,039
the most important thing it's been the

101
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:03,899
Bedrock of our foundation it's an

102
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,120
industry that's why we're here

103
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,000
everything else is like a benefit like

104
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,340
the adult use side hemp legalized hemp

105
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,900
that only came from legalized medical we

106
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,239
started that in the United States we

107
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,920
didn't even get hemp until 2014 back in

108
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,360
the United States and then it just keeps

109
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:20,579
getting re-clarified and so forth so

110
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,860
like right now if you want to survive

111
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:27,599
this like we have to get to work [ __ ]

112
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:29,280
is if you know the Britney Spears song

113
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,098
you should you should watch it it's

114
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,378
really good okay so you know I mentioned

115
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:35,818
this last year as well like in the

116
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:37,620
United States we're like the fifth

117
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:39,839
largest commodity already

118
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,519
cannabis it's not even federally illegal

119
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,259
in America so when you think about

120
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,120
globally like it's only going to be a

121
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:46,919
matter of time until cannabis again is

122
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,599
the largest agricultural commodity in

123
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:50,158
the world and I'm not just talking about

124
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:53,098
like medical cannabis and recreational

125
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,179
Cannabis or you know CBD flowers and so

126
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:56,098
forth I'm talking about like the clothes

127
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,799
we wear the protein sources that like

128
00:03:56,098 --> 00:04:00,899
make our bodies how we print and how we

129
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,280
wipe our asses and there's like eight

130
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,780
billion of us now there's going to be 16

131
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,640
billion of us

132
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,140
we can't keep doing cotton we can't keep

133
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,219
doing Timber we can't keep doing the

134
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:10,018
same [ __ ] different day and expect

135
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:12,359
different results like this plant used

136
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,039
to like Keep Us Alive sail around the

137
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,840
world with it print our money on it

138
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:17,519
write our constitutions on it in our

139
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,340
case it doesn't really have that much

140
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,199
Merit anymore but uh you know

141
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,698
so no matter what you do just know like

142
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,639
this is something that's been illegal

143
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:28,259
for a long time and only actually in a

144
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,759
short time of our human history so like

145
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:30,600
we're taking the power back which is a

146
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,160
great thing

147
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,439
okay so we think about global medical

148
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,220
cannabis like what are we looking at in

149
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:40,259
2023 same [ __ ] different day what's the

150
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,479
biggest like problem that we have as a

151
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:44,400
medical cannabis industry globally is

152
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:45,599
that doctors are terrified about writing

153
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,000
a prescription for something they were

154
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,919
told was always a narcotic or like the

155
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,500
devil's lettuce or like addictive or the

156
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:55,560
same as heroin or cocaine like doctors

157
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,660
are not stoked on writing prescriptions

158
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,579
for heroin like I mean maybe in America

159
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,139
if it's fentanyl or other drugs joke

160
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:03,060
sorry horrible

161
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:06,300
but uh

162
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,680
jeez like how do we educate doctors how

163
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,939
do we continue to do this like it's

164
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,400
going to be more clinical trials and

165
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:12,418
it's not going to happen anytime fast so

166
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,859
like one of the things you got to know

167
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:15,599
if you're in medical cannabis it's not

168
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,160
going to be as fast as you think you're

169
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,680
not going to go from selling 100 kilos

170
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,600
this month like 20 000 kilos and have

171
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,759
your 20 000 hectare farm and be like a

172
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,199
[ __ ] Dole of cannabis medically it's

173
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,919
just not going to happen we had those

174
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,560
thoughts in 2015 16 17 18 and then they

175
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:33,659
started to fizzle and like now it's just

176
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,038
like a reality where I've been a part of

177
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,199
a company that went from like one

178
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,519
employee to 250 and now it's got 10

179
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,100
employees

180
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:43,198
you know large farm in Colombia similar

181
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,879
to a lot of producers you know we think

182
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,139
about like this is one of the most

183
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,579
important things that happened that

184
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,379
still no one talks about and I still

185
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:51,478
like this is so critical y'all remember

186
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:54,000
during coronavirus like we rescheduled

187
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:56,279
cannabis at the UN level with the who

188
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,339
the commission for narcotic drugs like

189
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:01,859
the CND it's like cannabis is not like

190
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:03,719
schedule one in their opinion anymore it

191
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,879
does have medicinal value it just needs

192
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,620
more evidence and remember like we're

193
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:09,418
well most of us are members like the UN

194
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,560
and it's like if they agree on something

195
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:11,939
we're going to do it kind of like you're

196
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,978
supposed to in the European commission

197
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:15,300
unless you're Germany or hungry most of

198
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:18,959
the time

199
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,460
you know oddly enough so most countries

200
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,299
are not in compliance with U.N law

201
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:22,560
anymore

202
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,840
where it's like they're supposed to

203
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,959
amend their Controlled Substances Act to

204
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:30,000
match what the UN what the who what the

205
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,500
CND said a couple countries are in

206
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,418
compliance more and more are happening

207
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,819
but like if we change that those tax

208
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:37,680
crazy shits about America like IRC 280e

209
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:39,360
all those things go away so just know

210
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,120
like internationally cannabis is

211
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,038
medicine it's already happened

212
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,259
most countries are just choosing not to

213
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:48,538
like believe that yet or adopt that but

214
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:49,979
they will just a matter of time so we

215
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:52,019
think globally like what's happening

216
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:54,360
with like recreational adult use we've

217
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:55,620
got Uruguay where's Uruguay again you

218
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,780
know I'm just kidding

219
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,759
you know small little country the first

220
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:01,859
country to have the courage like the

221
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,780
tenacity to like actually legalize and

222
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,819
go like this to the world Canada

223
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:07,138
followed suit we also have like the

224
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:09,180
Netherlands with the weed experiment

225
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:10,800
we've got the Social Clubs

226
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,959
uh that are going to be happening here

227
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,879
ish TBD depending on like how that that

228
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,379
worked when we get into Plan B you've

229
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,860
got like the medical clubs in Spain but

230
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:21,418
really other than Malta Luxembourg as of

231
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,280
two days ago with their vault vote which

232
00:07:21,418 --> 00:07:25,379
we're going to get into

233
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,179
you know Canada and Uruguay they're the

234
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:29,459
only places doing this and remember the

235
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,780
United States those blue things

236
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:32,219
I'm going to make a lot of parallels

237
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:33,598
between the United States and Europe and

238
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,340
I know that that's not really fun for

239
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,719
most Europeans but it's like it's the

240
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:38,519
opposite remember like we left here

241
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,919
because [ __ ] sucked we went and did some

242
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:42,779
crazy [ __ ] learn from us take that back

243
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,399
this way it's kind of like the you know

244
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:46,679
Switcheroo getting a little retro here

245
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,719
but this is going to happen it's just

246
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,038
going to be a matter of time and I've

247
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,419
been saying federally in the United

248
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:52,800
States it's going to be five to ten

249
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:53,879
years until we have like legalized

250
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,680
cannabis

251
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,439
but I've been saying that for like more

252
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,000
than five to ten years now so even

253
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:01,259
someone who's been around this long like

254
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,360
a dinosaur

255
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:05,400
[ __ ] it's not going to happen as fast as

256
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,800
we think and that people that don't want

257
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:10,079
it to happen the longer this goes the

258
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,460
more of us bleed the more they devalue

259
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,199
us the easier it's going to be for them

260
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:15,239
to acquire us which is going to happen

261
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,520
eventually so just know it's like it's

262
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,720
gonna suck you gotta entrench it's not

263
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,098
going to be like a five day it's not

264
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,840
going to be like taking over France you

265
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:23,819
know it's like it's going to take a long

266
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,739
time no friends France I'm gonna make

267
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:29,400
fun of France a little bit too sorry

268
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:31,800
okay so United States [ __ ] Cowboys

269
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,179
boom boom you know yesterday someone was

270
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,620
really fun like you Cowboys always come

271
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,598
over here and like yeah we are kind of

272
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,918
cowboys [ __ ] is a little crazy but this

273
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,979
is one Cowboy that's like still around

274
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:43,500
and what we've learned in the United

275
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,300
States I'm telling you is going to be so

276
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,980
indicative of what's Happening here

277
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:48,240
because it's already started it's like

278
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,879
here future

279
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,560
you know oh here's some future thoughts

280
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,778
for you so in America just remember

281
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,419
we've got almost

282
00:08:54,778 --> 00:09:01,799
350 million people

283
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:04,139
we we did almost 37 billion dollars U.S

284
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:06,059
in Revenue last year as an industry and

285
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:08,039
it's federally illegal like our whole

286
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:10,379
country like asset's been like changing

287
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:12,000
remember Texas has medical now but each

288
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:13,200
state is its own little country that's

289
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
one thing I want you to like remember

290
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,759
even though like we've got cross-border

291
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,980
and like one government like states do

292
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,600
have certain little rights compared just

293
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,879
like countries in the European Union you

294
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,399
got little rights not really but kind of

295
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:28,860
but when you can Flex those rights

296
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,778
that's when [ __ ] happens that's when

297
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,639
amazing things happen like that's when

298
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:34,259
we can undo unjustices that's when we

299
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,759
can start new Industries and policies

300
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:37,500
that's when we can actually like

301
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,419
illuminate that there was a problem with

302
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,278
something that the federal government or

303
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:42,120
the European Commission in this context

304
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,100
like

305
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,240
do you have a joke for like Uncle Sam of

306
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,200
like the European commission or

307
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,639
something I wish you had like some

308
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,500
figure we could make fun of but like our

309
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:50,220
Uncle Sam compared to your Uncle Sam or

310
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,100
like

311
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:55,320
Aunt Patty or whoever you know she is

312
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,940
it's very similar so like each state has

313
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,459
been like choosing to break federal law

314
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:01,980
and write their own policies the problem

315
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:04,018
is our government like our FDA Food and

316
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,539
Drug Administration or our USDA like

317
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:08,700
Department of Agriculture they can't

318
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:11,399
tell States how to regulate this or how

319
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,800
to like deal with pesticides or testing

320
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:16,019
or like potency or quality control

321
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:17,699
because it's federally illegal still in

322
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:20,639
America we're schedule one narcotic

323
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:24,540
heroin no medicinal value don't study it

324
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:26,399
don't touch it you know the rest of the

325
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:28,259
world's like hey it's changing so you

326
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,000
know big up to date here there's only

327
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:31,919
three states that still don't have some

328
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,320
sort of cannabis law and there's 50

329
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,240
states there's 21 now that have adult

330
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,879
use like legislation that's almost half

331
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,580
and DC like in Washington DC our Capital

332
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:43,860
which is not a state or District it's

333
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,839
recreationally legal there too

334
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,759
so like as this is happening just like

335
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,540
it's happening here with Germany with

336
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:53,458
Malta with Luxembourg yeah Czech

337
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:54,778
Republic the the pilot program that's

338
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,159
happening in Switzerland every little

339
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:57,600
country is like hmm how are we going to

340
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,679
do this and they're all going to do it

341
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,879
different and they're all going to [ __ ]

342
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,739
it up in a different way or another

343
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:04,679
there's going to be successes in some

344
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,120
failures in other parts it could go a

345
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:07,439
lot faster if you look at what's been

346
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,720
working in the United States what

347
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,060
products work what concentrations work

348
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,278
what tax rates work if you over tax this

349
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:16,078
the illicit Market just continues to

350
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:18,120
take market share if you make it like

351
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:20,039
too cheap the illicit Market's going to

352
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,159
go away if you give way too many

353
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:24,719
licenses free market tons of businesses

354
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:27,000
die if you only give like one or two

355
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,620
licenses it's a little different so just

356
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,179
think like from this map we started in

357
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,980
Colorado as the first green it's just

358
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:33,419
spreading around there's more and more

359
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,800
initiatives happening but we're not

360
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:36,479
going to legalize anytime soon in

361
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:37,799
America either even though like there

362
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,360
was some like leak news like Biden's

363
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:41,338
going to deschedule it

364
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,259
you know who knows what's going to

365
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:45,240
happen politically so now we're into

366
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:46,740
Europe your world here

367
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,419
it's been pretty interesting to watch

368
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,000
like having worked over here for now

369
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:52,500
eight years and seeing like what's

370
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,360
happened with the bee farm with medical

371
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,339
cannabis Germany is amazing and how like

372
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,959
they've allowed medical cannabis but

373
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:00,000
then seeing how Portugal came in how

374
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,199
Spain's doing with their clubs how the

375
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,639
Netherlands with their weed experiment

376
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,040
happened while at the same time having

377
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,139
bedrockan like one of the like the first

378
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,939
highest quality like EU GMP producers

379
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:10,559
ever that didn't scale and like take

380
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,880
over the world like we thought because

381
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:13,739
the Canadians on the other side

382
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:14,820
legalized first and they thought they

383
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,278
would Dominate and take over Europe

384
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,778
which obviously didn't happen but when

385
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,879
we think about this little area here

386
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:22,139
this will be the largest cannabis Market

387
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:23,939
in the world

388
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:25,379
it's based on your population also when

389
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,540
we look at like drinking correlations

390
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:29,458
with other things disposable income

391
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:31,319
levels like eventually like preferences

392
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:33,059
will change things are going to happen

393
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,160
here

394
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:36,719
um it's not been good though like one of

395
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:38,219
the big news from yesterday you know

396
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,560
canopy that came over that spent like

397
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,940
what like 90 plus million in Spain

398
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,799
trying to get their medical license and

399
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:47,220
like all these Acquisitions and so forth

400
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:50,399
canopy growth at one point was had a 19

401
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:52,500
billion dollar market cap yesterday it

402
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,059
just went under 400 million and remember

403
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,700
there's a big difference between a

404
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:59,939
billion and a million

405
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,660
so like when you're like 78 down for the

406
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,820
year

407
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:06,179
and when you're stuck or your market cap

408
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:09,240
is 2.1 [ __ ] percent of what it was in

409
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:10,379
2021 what's that what do you think

410
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,600
that's going to be like for you all over

411
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:14,399
here and your public company stocks and

412
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,959
like this company's going public on like

413
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,700
the Tel Aviv exchange this one on the

414
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,138
Frankfurt this one in London how's that

415
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,060
working for everybody

416
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:22,680
you know it's not super great but when

417
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:24,599
we think about this just think like it's

418
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:27,419
America but not America but America but

419
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,339
not you you have a lot more rights as

420
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,439
countries you know than we do as States

421
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:33,839
but just thinking like Luxembourg

422
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,300
Germany check I mean shengdon with the

423
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,800
Swiss like it's happening we've got

424
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:39,179
sanctioned production happening in the

425
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:41,039
Netherlands through the weed experiment

426
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:42,479
which I love how in Europe you can

427
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,278
actually it's everywhere you can say

428
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,440
some sort of word and then everything's

429
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:48,299
okay it's like it's not the weed like

430
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,459
legalization project it's like it's a

431
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:51,419
weird experiment we're not legalizing

432
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,739
we're just an experience but we're gonna

433
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:54,719
give licenses and allow people to

434
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,700
produce cannabis and sell it to anyone

435
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,079
who's 21 or older sounds like

436
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,820
legalization to me but it's an

437
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,078
experiment or like Putin can be like

438
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,240
it's not a war it's like a military

439
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:06,599
exercise you know I'm just you know bad

440
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,278
bad joke so no matter where you are here

441
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,139
think like

442
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:11,519
as soon as a couple of these countries

443
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:13,860
start to fall

444
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,600
and like change their positions it's

445
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,980
gonna be a matter of time until they all

446
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,560
do but not everyone's going to come on

447
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,300
quick like you've got Indiana's

448
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:24,539
um like who's the biggest [ __ ] in

449
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:25,859
Europe like uh-huh I don't actually know

450
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:27,480
um but like there's gonna be like a

451
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,680
couple holdouts and there's gonna be the

452
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,060
ones that are slower and there's gonna

453
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,159
be some that don't want to have

454
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:33,419
production and only want to do sales how

455
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,519
that's all going to play out we don't

456
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:37,679
know but it will be very very similar

457
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,600
you can't cross borders you can do what

458
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,039
you want in your own little house it's

459
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,079
gonna be similar to Germany why did cure

460
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,219
Leaf take like a preemptive position to

461
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:46,319
purchase one of the three medical

462
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,879
domestic producers in Germany even

463
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,820
though they didn't spend that 20 million

464
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:52,740
euros yet it was like 19.5 but it's like

465
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,079
hey if we want to we can execute this

466
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,579
option because most likely domestic

467
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:58,919
production is going to be required for

468
00:14:56,578 --> 00:15:00,059
when domestic Supply happens now you're

469
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:02,219
going to do it with these Social Club

470
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:04,919
things like I got my three plants a year

471
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,379
these people can grow 500 for me 1500

472
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:09,299
plants ain't [ __ ] I mean I can grow like

473
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:11,039
a 10 kilo plant in Colombia or somewhere

474
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:13,198
but like if you're cycling through a lot

475
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,480
of plants which still that leak law said

476
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:17,099
three plans per year

477
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,199
that's not that I mean that's not good

478
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,820
like unless you grew really really big

479
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:22,198
plans you know most people are that's

480
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,459
not even enough cannabis to smoke in a

481
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:25,919
year

482
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:28,799
so yeah what's going to happen you know

483
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,778
Plan B program like kind of seems like a

484
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,338
failure I think Germany was really

485
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:33,480
excited and got everyone excited hey

486
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:34,620
you're getting power when you say you're

487
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,240
gonna like do some [ __ ] and then you

488
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,039
don't have to deliver on it I guess

489
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,180
politicians do that sometimes just like

490
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:41,819
you know

491
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:43,379
it happens but now like when the rubber

492
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,940
meets the road like the tire is like

493
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:46,439
moving it's like how is Germany actually

494
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,459
going to do this because that leaked

495
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,500
draft

496
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:51,179
doesn't look that good and there's some

497
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,159
things that could change in it

498
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:54,719
but realistically there is not much

499
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:56,759
business opportunity for when you read

500
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,079
what plan B is I mean you've got the

501
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:59,759
clubs there's going to be the real

502
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,198
estate for that the biggest opportunity

503
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,939
which I've mentioned already is like the

504
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:04,319
homegirl like who's going to sell lights

505
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,000
who's going to sell soil who's going to

506
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,920
sell fertilizer and nutrients to like

507
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,299
everyone who thinks I'm gonna grow these

508
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:10,919
fruit plants at home and like in my

509
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:12,599
garden or like where

510
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:14,399
there's going to be some like big uptick

511
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,980
in like those kind of sides but like

512
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,720
there's really not a commercial viable

513
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,399
opportunity right now based on like what

514
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,199
we see for the elite draft which sucks

515
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,000
for y'all

516
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:25,559
um you know I made definitely a joke

517
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,120
about this the other day plan B is like

518
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,219
a birth control pill in America for it's

519
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,480
like you know the condom breaks or

520
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,040
something

521
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,420
that's kind of like what plan B is to me

522
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:34,679
it's like well we were going to do

523
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:36,240
something cool but like it didn't really

524
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:37,679
work out so let's just do this to like

525
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,440
hope for the best

526
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:43,620
but like realistically Plan B for no

527
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,180
matter how you read it I don't see an

528
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,339
opportunity other than these clubs now

529
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:49,979
through that opportunity though those

530
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,420
clubs could start to make brands that

531
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,759
could get like consumer reputations

532
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:55,799
known the bummer too you're going to be

533
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,060
a member of One Club you can't be a

534
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:58,679
member of another club

535
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:00,479
in Colorado is so radical like

536
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:01,799
originally our medical you would go to

537
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,539
one dispensary and make them your

538
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:05,578
caregiver for while you were there and

539
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:07,078
assign your six plans to them but then

540
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:08,399
you could go to another store and do the

541
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:10,318
same thing the next day and we just kept

542
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,120
making more Plans by like people going

543
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,379
to more stores and we would still be

544
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:15,659
their care provider even though they

545
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,760
came in one time four years ago we still

546
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,679
would grow their six plants for them

547
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:21,298
you know so it's going to be really

548
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,000
weird what happens but like Brands

549
00:17:21,298 --> 00:17:25,918
consumer reputation the tech software is

550
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,240
like the deal between those like clubs

551
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,160
and deal with their compliance I see

552
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,019
some opportunities with those but

553
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,660
realistically for like Mass market like

554
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:35,400
37 40 billion Revenue like what we're

555
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,960
doing in the US illegally

556
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,700
not going to happen here as quickly as

557
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,558
most people think

558
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,480
so some big changes happen though in the

559
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:45,178
last couple of days I mean Luxembourg

560
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,980
baller voted you know they've been

561
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:48,600
talking about it for a while it's very

562
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,980
similar to what is it like four plants

563
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:53,119
or something like that

564
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,120
one more than you

565
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,240
one plant it really isn't that much

566
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,558
either but still like one plant can

567
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,839
change the world like this one's about

568
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,279
to do so luxembourg's got the courage to

569
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:03,779
kind of come forward even in this last

570
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:06,720
couple of days too

571
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:09,119
what this is almost like my joke with

572
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,860
this one is just unfortunate it's like

573
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,298
doing this to like help alleviate like

574
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:13,259
war from I'm like you're still in the

575
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:16,679
[ __ ] War like don't get everybody

576
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:18,240
stoned yet like keep fighting but like I

577
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,320
understand you know but this is a

578
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,480
beautiful thing I remember going to

579
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:22,980
Ukraine before the war really focusing

580
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,058
on some like big hem projects and

581
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,380
thinking about like what that country

582
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:27,599
could do and like just seeing the

583
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,160
agricultural production the costs and

584
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,019
then all this bullshit's happened which

585
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,279
is still happening but then to like come

586
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:34,319
out and say okay we're going to legalize

587
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:36,779
medical and as you actually read through

588
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,279
what he had said he's sanctioning and

589
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:41,160
going to allow like domestic Medical

590
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:42,960
Supply first which would then allow

591
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,519
export if you do it compliantly with

592
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,840
with lawn if they make it as part of the

593
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:50,160
EU you know and win the war like

594
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:52,319
that could be a really big thing because

595
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,960
what you produce there 12 hours away by

596
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,579
semi 600 euros to get something here and

597
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,200
a cost like who won like how much is a

598
00:18:56,579 --> 00:19:01,079
hectare of land Elise in Germany like

599
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,240
what like 600 euros it's 20 euros there

600
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:04,439
so I like Ukraine is [ __ ] awesome I

601
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,720
think that's why everyone's like likes

602
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,340
it so much the climate and so forth so

603
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,679
when I was talking about your stocks as

604
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:12,058
well like this was you know not that

605
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:14,340
long ago they're all worse they're about

606
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:15,960
30 worse than they were even from when I

607
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:17,939
screenshotted that

608
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,019
so it's like don't just go public don't

609
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,100
just think that you can do the same

610
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:21,839
thing that everyone else has done

611
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:22,980
because it's going to be very similar to

612
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,899
like what's happened with everyone else

613
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,000
I remember that it had one more France

614
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,559
joke too so meanwhile Luxembourg is

615
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,058
going to allow this France now allows

616
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:31,980
you to pay your taxes or like you're

617
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:34,379
fine instantly like to bribe like a

618
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,279
police officer AKA so it's like every

619
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,660
country is going to do something

620
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:38,940
different some are going to legalize

621
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,140
some are going to decriminalize some are

622
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,600
going to allow a little production in

623
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:44,460
some clubs some like Malta Malta might

624
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,899
actually just do like a large production

625
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,480
let some of their Medicals switch over

626
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,798
to the adult use side which is a hundred

627
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,819
percent of the time what happened in

628
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:52,798
America

629
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:55,200
every time we had a medical State go to

630
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:56,759
a recreational state or adult use the

631
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,160
first people who get to like switch over

632
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:00,960
are the current license holders

633
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,058
why do you think cure relief bought that

634
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,919
position in Germany because it's like

635
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:06,660
100 of the time on the other side of the

636
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,740
pond it happened probably going to be

637
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,298
the same thing here where they're going

638
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,640
to give new licenses to like new

639
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:13,139
producers that's possible too because

640
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,120
you got insurance paying for one like

641
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,320
there's so much unknown with this that's

642
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:17,759
where there's the opportunity which

643
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,399
we're about to just dive into in the

644
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,839
last couple moments here

645
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,160
um so something that I do love about

646
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:24,058
America that I've learned is like real

647
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,279
estate

648
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:28,200
if I had been into real estate

649
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:31,200
15 years ago I'd literally be the

650
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,000
richest person in cannabis right now

651
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,640
every single time you have cultivation

652
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,500
manufacturing retail delivery there has

653
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,240
to be a property involved that property

654
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,619
typically can't be bank owned has to be

655
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,720
owned out right you have to have the

656
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:44,579
consent of the owner typically has to be

657
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,259
zoned something very specific based on

658
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:49,199
whatever that Burgermeister or like

659
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:50,879
local position decided it should be

660
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,798
typically can't be too close to a church

661
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,299
or a daycare or an addiction Center or

662
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:55,440
something else we call this green zone

663
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:58,200
real estate

664
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,460
so as Europe starts to unfold just like

665
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,660
they did in the Netherlands like with

666
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,579
the weed experiment like where you

667
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,440
position those 10 operators which was a

668
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:06,240
[ __ ] Lottery and a joke but like

669
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,120
there was big constraints on real estate

670
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,200
it's the same thing here like where are

671
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:11,819
they going to allow the sales maybe

672
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,140
it'll be at the pharmacy Zone by like

673
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:14,819
all these different families maybe it'll

674
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,860
be at different places where will clubs

675
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:18,538
be allowed they're not going to just let

676
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,219
them be like next to parks and so forth

677
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:22,079
like you know

678
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,759
this is Germany things are a little bit

679
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,079
more strict than that so even though you

680
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,298
can walk down the street from the beer

681
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:28,558
or in the future like after 8 pm at

682
00:21:27,298 --> 00:21:30,119
night you can like walk down the

683
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:31,619
sidewalk smoking a joint now but not

684
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:33,719
after seven in the morning to eight at

685
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:34,918
night so just you know set your timers

686
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,839
but real estate will be one of the

687
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:38,880
biggest things that you can actually do

688
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:40,199
and this would be like over a five ten

689
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,240
year play but typically for Real Estate

690
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,100
we get three to six times the returns

691
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,880
that we do on any normal real estate

692
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:50,519
deal like I still get 12 to 18 debt for

693
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,200
Real Estate just because Banks can't

694
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:54,418
Finance it it's going to be very similar

695
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,700
here large-scale institutions are not

696
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:58,679
going to be stoked to give big old loans

697
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,058
like cannabis companies or like Social

698
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:02,159
Clubs I'm going to give them a business

699
00:22:00,058 --> 00:22:03,058
loan like not going to happen that's

700
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,280
where there's going to be some big

701
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:07,139
opportunities for investors as well it's

702
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,879
hard to raise money in this space like I

703
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,100
said we're federally illegal no one

704
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,659
wants to invest into Pablo Escobar you

705
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:15,418
know if you're like the big guy like

706
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:17,220
we're not Pablo

707
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:19,559
Pablo

708
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,120
um but it's hard as hell to raise money

709
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:22,859
so just know that like in these

710
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:24,538
processes if you're an investor or an

711
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:25,798
operator you need to start looking for

712
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:27,058
like where my capital is going to be

713
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:29,700
safe and who's going to manage it well

714
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:32,279
or how to actually get real capital and

715
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,558
debt is by far like so much easier than

716
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:35,940
Equity especially when it's asset backed

717
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:37,619
everyone's going to think the same thing

718
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,940
I mentioned this every single time I

719
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:40,979
talk because this has been a 10-year

720
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,500
thing and I've only been right about it

721
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,419
so I don't see it just like spiking back

722
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,740
up our bubbles already happened your

723
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:49,259
bubbles already happened here in Europe

724
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,819
too for stocks if Germany had come out

725
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:53,158
with a plan a of like a massive we're

726
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:54,899
going to give 50 production licenses and

727
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:57,299
50 manufacturing licenses and we're

728
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,679
going to give 2 000 retail licenses

729
00:22:57,298 --> 00:23:01,019
based on population and all these

730
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,519
burgers or like little towns like that

731
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:04,079
could have been cool that's not how it

732
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:05,279
happened so like that bubble is not

733
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,439
going to happen here

734
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:10,440
well whenever these these big news the

735
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,019
bubble was from like 2018 it popped so

736
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,340
bad in 21 it'll never recover like worse

737
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:16,558
than like the tax side so remember that

738
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:17,819
was you know originally here's our

739
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:21,359
Five-Year Plan you see those original

740
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:25,200
bubbles here's our today and I'm even 33

741
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:27,298
lower than I was two days ago at the gif

742
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,159
which just is like not a p-value right

743
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:30,960
you know it's got not five percent but

744
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:34,679
like three percent more in like three

745
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,240
days that's [ __ ] so like public is not

746
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,679
the way to like raise Capital right now

747
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,380
like you're not going to take over

748
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,240
Europe and like raise this big thing and

749
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,500
oh you're gonna be like the next canopy

750
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,940
growth that's not even cool to say

751
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,558
anymore because remember they're only

752
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,900
2.1 percent the value that they

753
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,038
originally were so like don't compare

754
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,440
yourself like we're gonna be like them

755
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:54,179
like you want a failure probably not a

756
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,380
great idea

757
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:57,000
um so if you need money if you're an

758
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,500
operator if you're an ancillary company

759
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,240
if you're a packaging company if you're

760
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,900
a producer in Portugal If you're like

761
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,400
anything I guarantee you you well other

762
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,780
than maybe five ten percent of you you

763
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,460
don't have enough money to survive the

764
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:10,259
next two to three years because it's not

765
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,600
going to be as awesome as you think

766
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:13,798
so how are you going to survive how are

767
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:15,119
you going to downsize how are you going

768
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:16,619
to get efficient how are you going to

769
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:19,558
start to prepare your financial models

770
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:20,939
to get Capital that is huge It's like

771
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:22,859
because as soon as you see like the

772
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,360
light like oh shoot we only got cash

773
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:26,399
flow for three months you're [ __ ]

774
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:28,439
dead already as a business

775
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,419
I've seen it happen like thousands of

776
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,740
clients like they come to us desperate

777
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:33,120
like they'll get merchant cash advance

778
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,679
loans they'll like do personal

779
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:37,079
guarantees like they'll take out a

780
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,460
second mortgage you're already screwed

781
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:39,899
if you're doing that like so you've got

782
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,038
to plan your business farther in the

783
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,780
future than you could possibly imagine

784
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:44,279
everyone always thinks like we're going

785
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:45,960
to build this brand and everyone's Gonna

786
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:48,599
Know It And of course it's going to have

787
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:51,620
canon in the name or 420 or something

788
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:53,939
stupid as [ __ ] like Pharma can

789
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:55,259
just come on like so if you're going to

790
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,058
build a brand just stay away from that

791
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:58,679
what I've learned in America it's

792
00:24:57,058 --> 00:25:00,000
companies that don't have anything to do

793
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:02,220
with cannabis

794
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,079
or anything green as part of it that are

795
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,640
actually like brands that people like or

796
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,619
that we've had like massive exits on

797
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,900
like I've built a company from one thing

798
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:12,000
to like 19 locations and sold it to

799
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,038
Jay-Z's public company its name had

800
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,419
nothing to do with cannabis whatsoever

801
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:17,640
it's like those are the ones that are

802
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:19,559
really recognizable or like so get a

803
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,940
little creative but like don't just

804
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:22,440
think like it's all about the brand

805
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,240
either because if your product sucks

806
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,100
your brand doesn't matter no one's going

807
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,659
to re-buy it don't spend a million

808
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:30,119
dollars on a logo like spend your time

809
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:31,980
like on like legal protections IP

810
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:33,599
knowing that like litigation is going to

811
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,400
be so big and the bigger you get the

812
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:36,899
more [ __ ] you'll have to deal with

813
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,820
staff are going to steal from you

814
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,778
clients are going to steal from you like

815
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:41,220
there's going to be more and more

816
00:25:39,778 --> 00:25:43,140
lawsuits people aren't going to pay you

817
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:45,600
like litigation that's another big thing

818
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,460
for like investors right now like where

819
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,219
to focus like litigation there are

820
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:51,600
carcasses and dead companies all over

821
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,339
like we've been buying things from

822
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,259
Canada importing them into America not

823
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:57,359
cannabis but like lights Greenhouse

824
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:59,099
equipment same thing it's like you know

825
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,479
you've got uh clever leaves all these

826
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:02,399
other companies in Portugal other places

827
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,880
like de-stressed assets are [ __ ]

828
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,900
awesome get BD in that like get get deep

829
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,340
into that that's where there's

830
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,019
opportunities even though it seems weird

831
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:11,399
but you can cannibalize things that were

832
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:12,960
failures and actually put them towards

833
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,600
opportunities and that's where

834
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,519
distressed assets for investors now

835
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,019
so much opportunity in that and like

836
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:20,940
what's the wisdom of like don't do what

837
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:22,679
everyone did in the past don't do what

838
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,298
like the failures did in America don't

839
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:26,880
do anything like they did in Canada

840
00:26:24,298 --> 00:26:28,980
whatsoever I mean legalizing first is

841
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,539
good legalized medical is good but like

842
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,120
that's where the opportunities are

843
00:26:30,538 --> 00:26:34,558
world's changing hard obviously on my

844
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,239
Grand Canyon pictures like we've got

845
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,278
heat pressure we've got all these

846
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,960
shifting changes new things happening

847
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:42,119
and if you don't evolve you're dead

848
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,100
already so like that business plan of

849
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:46,259
yours like if you every single person in

850
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:48,778
here who owns a business or Works in one

851
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:50,819
if you ask yourself or your owner like

852
00:26:48,778 --> 00:26:52,980
what's our Five-Year Plan if they don't

853
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:54,778
know it start looking for another job if

854
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,460
you don't know it fix your [ __ ]

855
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:57,720
company start thinking hard in the

856
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,640
future or like you're not going to have

857
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,319
one like if you can't see like what's

858
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,000
like it's always like I gotta survive

859
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,740
today what's going to happen next week

860
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,659
what's next month it's like you got to

861
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,859
take that moment as a leader or an

862
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:09,480
investor be like what is this thing

863
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:11,099
going to be in five years is it worth

864
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,259
anything is it not

865
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:14,939
but it's changing so fast

866
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:15,720
most startups most companies are going

867
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,179
to fail

868
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,519
it's just life so don't be like everyone

869
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:22,740
else and don't like fight everyone it's

870
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:24,359
like your collaborators everyone that's

871
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:27,058
here everyone that's at this conference

872
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:28,199
don't be a dick talk to people get to

873
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:30,058
know them they're going through the same

874
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,620
things as you they might even have a

875
00:27:30,058 --> 00:27:33,178
solution to your problem and you're like

876
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:35,038
oh they're a comp competitor and I'm

877
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:36,659
like too cool to talk to them like we're

878
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:39,359
in this together this is a lifelong

879
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:40,980
Mission we only have so much time

880
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:42,058
because like I've been doing this for a

881
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,380
long time and the things I would have

882
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:45,839
done differently compared to like what

883
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,400
we could do differently like we have now

884
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:49,259
so like how are you going to look at

885
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,820
this in the future take some of these

886
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:52,319
lessons from like what this was because

887
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:55,558
realistically

888
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:57,980
we only have so much time and uh times

889
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:57,980
now

890
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,480
peace
