1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:05,040
but now coming up uh we are very honored

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,919
to uh she's going to discuss the

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,160
research and development efforts in

4
00:00:06,918 --> 00:00:11,160
Slovenia uh she's a plant breeder

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,199
project leader at the Slovenian

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,759
Institute of hop research and Brewing

7
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:19,119
that's fantastic let's hear it for

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:23,359
assistant professor Andrea

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,359
[Applause]

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,320
chattano hello

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,160
everyone uh thank you very much for the

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,719
opp opportunity to give a short speech

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,439
about our work um yes I'm coming from

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:41,239
The Institute which was already named U

15
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:43,640
my field of work is uh plant breeding U

16
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:46,280
so as the name is of The Institute we

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,320
are developing hob varieties and now in

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,480
the last years we are working on

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,280
cannabis research as well um it's an

20
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,919
honor to talk about the research and

21
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,079
development efforts uh in the field of

22
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,760
cannabis in

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,878
Slovenia uh and why is let's say uh why

24
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,679
it was the topic of our Institute to

25
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:09,079
work in it because hop and hemp are the

26
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:13,159
closest relatives they're both coming

27
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:16,039
the species from canabas family they

28
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:18,359
have a lot of common things but uh

29
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,240
opposite as well and I can say that

30
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:24,118
cannabis is really um even more

31
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:27,719
interesting because of some plant traits

32
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:30,680
it can be done much faster and giving a

33
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:34,039
lot of um results in a short shorter way

34
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:37,000
than let's say hop as a perennial plant

35
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,439
um so we so plant breeding is one of the

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,560
main topic of The Institute uh we have

37
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:44,639
developed so I'm working for more than

38
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,879
25 years in the field of research and

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,478
plan breeding and we have developed more

40
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:51,718
than let's say 10 15 I'm not sure

41
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:52,759
varieties which are not now covering our

42
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:56,359
hop

43
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,399
Fields um in Slovenia uh we are using

44
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:01,000
different classical and biotechnical

45
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,359
approaches together with University from

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,159
lublana biotechnical faculty we're

47
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:09,560
developing really Hightech um Hightech

48
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:13,520
work and methods which can be used in

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:16,239
our breeding program um Slovenia is uh

50
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,319
the fifth in the world looking for if we

51
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,039
are uh focused on Hop acreage per

52
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:24,560
country even if we are so small we are

53
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:28,719
on the fifth place and we are uh

54
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,159
exporting 98% of our crops so uh the

55
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,280
first question is why could not be the

56
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:35,840
same with the medical cannabis it can be

57
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,840
the same uh because we can produce and

58
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,680
we can export even if we are so small

59
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,640
and we if we cannot drink so much of

60
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,879
beer uh we can export our hops so it is

61
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:49,719
the same case with medical cannabis as

62
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:51,518
well and 89% so the same percentage of

63
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:53,560
our Slovenian hop fields are covered

64
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,680
with our Slovenian hob varieties which

65
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,280
were developed our Institute so this is

66
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,120
really an opportunity for hemp grown in

67
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,280
Slovenia

68
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,480
we are also tightly connected with the

69
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,878
um let's say experts in the group of

70
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:13,439
prime minister to do the let's say as

71
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:17,000
much as possible uh good legislation

72
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:19,759
basr for working in medical growing

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,919
medical cannabis growing and research of

74
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,079
course uh what are our fields of

75
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,798
interest interest so I'm coming from the

76
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,400
research which is linked more to the

77
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,519
agriculture so the first is agriculture

78
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,319
science and research

79
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:33,879
very close to the agriculture is

80
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,639
environment so we want to be as

81
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:40,000
sustainable as possible and hemp and

82
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:44,000
cannabis are giving all these um all

83
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,120
these um um possibilities of course

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,639
medicines which is not our topic

85
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,239
veterinary medicine Cosmetics as well

86
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:53,598
and construction

87
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,719
industry uh so therefore we we met

88
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,560
sometimes ago with the the Talman group

89
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:00,959
so we realized that we have the same

90
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,438
fields of interest uh so there were a

91
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,759
lot of business opportunities private P

92
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,479
Public Partnerships uh so I'm coming

93
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,598
from the public Institute but

94
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:11,878
nevertheless our budget is almost one

95
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,639
half of it is coming from the market so

96
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:15,198
there the different comparing to the

97
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:18,238
let's say universities or

98
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,959
faculties uh so we uh very quickly find

99
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:24,399
that we have some some common things

100
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,280
which can uh be together gathered in the

101
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:30,000
Cannabis Consortium so this Consortium

102
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:32,559
was established

103
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,038
uh we name it Conan so Consortium of

104
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,680
cannabis and we are including a lot of

105
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:41,199
different faculties from both

106
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,879
universities so from maribor and lublana

107
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,560
uh different uh companies which are

108
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:49,159
working in the field of Canabis Research

109
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,280
business or whatever and what are our

110
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,600
main topics of Agriculture environment

111
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,799
sustainability and Medicine uh we are

112
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,000
looking for different kind of

113
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,960
applications which can be used uh

114
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,319
collaboration as I mentioned between

115
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:04,120
different SL I scientific research

116
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:06,759
organizations and companies and what is

117
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:10,360
our main topic is to develop really

118
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:14,879
Innovative products uh from different

119
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:17,360
medical biotechnology and new breeding

120
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,879
approaches um so this is one of our

121
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,520
let's say uh working field the with the

122
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:27,478
tan group uh few years ago we started

123
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:30,159
let's say our PhD thesis and uh so the

124
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:33,079
the colleague has she has uh

125
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,000
done so finish her PhD in the last year

126
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:37,120
it was done together with the University

127
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,319
of lublana biotechnical faculty and

128
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,519
faculty of Pharmacy uh so we have uh

129
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,160
just look working on outdoor hemp

130
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:48,839
varieties and we were selecting between

131
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:51,120
three varieties different uh chemotypes

132
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:53,198
and genotypes so because this is these

133
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,478
are population varieties you can find

134
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,720
different plants inside the same

135
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:59,839
population uh so we were looking for the

136
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,919
different chemotypes and we found found

137
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:06,758
out some really interesting uh plans

138
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:08,519
between in the in the same varieties

139
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,038
which can have let's say perhaps higher

140
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:14,560
CBD higher CBG and there really

141
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:17,279
potential to develop new varieties with

142
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,439
the new projects probably could be

143
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,239
founding of the Ministry of Agriculture

144
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,478
culture very

145
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:27,800
supporting

146
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:29,639
um the third let's say uh team is our

147
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,160
Institute is working with one German

148
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,560
Czech company uh together with the

149
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,120
faculty of Pharmacy and the Pham so we

150
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,160
are we have the allowance to work in

151
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:44,280
indoor uh to develop high THC varieties

152
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,599
these are some of our photos so we are

153
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:49,119
we are let's say using first molecular

154
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:52,879
markers to to distinguish between male

155
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,959
female plants uh now uh then we are

156
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:58,120
using our lab we have the chemical lab

157
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:00,239
of accredited for some analysis and

158
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,360
there we are doing different

159
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,319
chemical analysis of essential oils

160
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,280
cannabinoids which can be used later in

161
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,759
the for different Pharmacy or product or

162
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:14,000
medical uses uh of course everything is

163
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:15,960
indoor protected and we are so our main

164
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,680
goals are of course as all plant

165
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:20,159
varieties to have high yield high

166
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,639
quality yield and here in this case we

167
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,720
are looking for high THC varieties High

168
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,199
CBD and the other cannabinoids and we

169
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,000
are all um everything is done in

170
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,680
accordance with The Gap and and gacp uh

171
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,519
Quality Systems compliant with Emma

172
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,038
guidelines for

173
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:42,000
hemp um we are using now in this later

174
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:44,839
procedur feminization of course to have

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,879
the just female so that the seeds which

176
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:50,158
will be sewn can have just uh we will it

177
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,039
will be just female plants uh we are

178
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:54,759
doing of course cuttings we are using

179
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:56,719
tissue culture uh to conserve the

180
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:58,800
genotypes and we are doing as I

181
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,919
mentioned different kind analysis all

182
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,158
for this let's say develop candidate

183
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:06,000
varieties with high content of specific

184
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:09,079
metabolites which can be used further as

185
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,720
I mentioned in medical or far Pharmacy

186
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:13,959
purposes uh what are the advantages and

187
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:19,039
opportunities of medical cannabis as we

188
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:21,638
all know here um it can be really one of

189
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:26,158
Slovenian exporting crop as I mentioned

190
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:28,720
we are exporting 98% of our Hops uh so

191
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:30,759
then it is incredible when we get the

192
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,080
reply from the Ministry of Health that

193
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:35,680
we can just have let's a few grams of

194
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,800
medical cannabis in Slovenia because

195
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,559
there are just few patients and we don't

196
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,199
need more than just few grams of it in

197
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:44,199
Slovenia so this is really something

198
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,200
ridiculous especially if we are looking

199
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,240
just do a simple comparison with The Hop

200
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,720
industry which gives the it is the

201
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:56,320
biggest um e exporting agriculture crop

202
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,560
and it gives the first um marks so after

203
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,800
the second world war this the the first

204
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:04,559
foreign um money income in Slovenian or

205
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:07,159
that in that time Yugoslavian uh

206
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:09,319
Parliament so uh what are the advantages

207
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:11,919
so we can we have the great opportunity

208
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,040
and contribution to the economy

209
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:16,519
increased funds in the state budgets we

210
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:19,599
can prevent the black market activity as

211
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:22,480
it was uh mentioned before uh and of

212
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,959
course um it can be all done under

213
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,039
controlled conditions with of course

214
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:30,679
strict regulation but clever enough that

215
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:32,838
it cannot stop the business uh

216
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:35,559
opportunities uh what are now current

217
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:37,519
shortcomings based on our knowledge it's

218
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:40,078
really ridiculous that we have to

219
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,679
destroy all of uh products which are

220
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:44,759
developing in our indoor activities it

221
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:47,278
could be used for different different at

222
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:49,600
least research things now we have to

223
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:52,200
destroy all flowers with different

224
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,079
cannabinoids and different essential oil

225
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:58,200
compounds because it's prohibited to use

226
00:09:55,078 --> 00:10:00,039
our plant material even in research and

227
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,640
medical purposes

228
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:04,559
and we have limited number of plants

229
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,720
which can be grown so we are looking

230
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:11,000
forward to change our law and to start

231
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,639
something more in positive way uh so to

232
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,639
sum to sum up uh if Slovenia holds a

233
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:19,639
leading position in global hop in

234
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:21,879
Industry uh and if we have really uh

235
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:24,519
distinguishing hob varieties which were

236
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:27,200
developed at our Institute uh we have

237
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:29,879
really um the top experts at our

238
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Institute in some field of of field of

239
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:37,519
work um in the global and worldwide

240
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,160
scale um there is really good

241
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,200
establishment at our Institute so we

242
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:44,439
have hob varieties we have plant patent

243
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,759
in the United States for one of them uh

244
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:51,040
numerous of them are protected at the

245
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:54,200
European um region and so all these

246
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:56,599
methods Investments which were done in

247
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,600
hop industry can be really similarly

248
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,959
used for cannabis research and

249
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,360
development

250
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:05,599
uh from our Institute uh so to conclude

251
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,480
with this Slovenia stands ready to

252
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,440
become a worldclass research and

253
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,480
development hub for the Cannabis sector

254
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,480
as well thank you very

255
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:19,838
[Applause]

256
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:23,039
much question we have time for

257
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,040
questions you

258
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,200
learned okay thank you for your

259
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:34,720
presentation you said um um your

260
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:38,680
products are male and female um um so uh

261
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,480
I want to know uh do you do some um

262
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:44,559
research on both of them or just female

263
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:48,079
or do you do research on male plants too

264
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:50,159
yeah and uh it's uh it's the same with

265
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,319
with the Hop plant as well we also have

266
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:55,958
female and male plants there and in both

267
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:59,360
cases we are using just female uh female

268
00:11:55,958 --> 00:12:01,039
plants for to getting crop so uh it is

269
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,000
interesting because half of the let's

270
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,399
say heredity is coming from the male

271
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,278
plants as well and when we make Crossing

272
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,559
between female and male plants is the

273
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:11,559
same importance of the male plant as

274
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:13,919
well but unfortunately because of

275
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:17,319
limited space and money and everything

276
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:19,360
we cannot focus our time and knowledge

277
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,800
to the male plants we are more focused

278
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,240
on the selection of female plants but

279
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:25,719
yeah the male plants are still there

280
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:30,039
which we have to which we have to

281
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,680
analyze and look of them as well

282
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:33,879
great is there another question I have a

283
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,719
question is it possible to make a

284
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:38,559
cannabis that tastes like

285
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,519
beer um the Cannabis which tastes like

286
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:44,119
beer we have the beer which tastes like

287
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:48,799
cannabis already that's even better we

288
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:51,078
can do both be fantastic is there more

289
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,838
questions man everyone's so efficient

290
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:55,239
today yeah it's the effect of the

291
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,360
weather probably nice sunny weather

292
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,440
thank you very much let's hear it for
