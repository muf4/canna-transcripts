that's prominent for many people here

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,920
thinking about where are the horizons of

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,239
research where are they taking us the

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,359
panel uh that we have here of uh subject

22
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:01,399
matter experts have a lot of experience

23
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:03,000
to share there will be uh of course a

24
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,719
bit of emphasis on the pharmaceutical

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,680
industry is that's the nature of the

26
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:10,798
panel discussion here but we will be

27
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,920
venturing a little bit beyond just the

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:18,840
narrow scope pharmaceutical industry uh

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:23,200
so briefly um we have in order Francesco

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:26,520
bauno uh and Professor Christian urz uh

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:30,840
athanasia Conley and professor badar

32
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:33,118
radich and uh and forgive give me if I

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,439
aasia athanasia

34
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:38,959
yeah uh indeed so we'd like to just give

35
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:41,758
each of the panelists uh a brief moment

36
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,879
to introduce yourselves what your

37
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,040
background is here and then we'll start

38
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:49,679
to to dive into the subject uh you want

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,200
to start us off Franchesco sure hello

40
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,799
everyone uh Franchesco here from Italy

41
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:00,399
but I worked uh globally in North

42
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,719
America and around Europe and and

43
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,759
basically we're doing a lot of research

44
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:08,199
and uh in the pharmaceutical industry

45
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,878
and there's a lot of uh you know

46
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:15,238
developments in the last years going on

47
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:18,639
on you know the medical side but we

48
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,640
focus basically on more on the patient

49
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,039
perspective so we have a completely

50
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:26,199
different model than the pharmaceutical

51
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:28,959
standard one on the standardized product

52
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:31,039
just for the market and it's going to be

53
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,360
great to talk about this with the with

54
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,719

as many of our customers can

102
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:41,639
attest great and boo uh hello everybody

103
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm B dadich coming from

104
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:49,000
Slovenia uh I'm started on the other

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,079
side as a uh activist uh 20 more or more

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,959
years

107
00:04:50,079 --> 00:05:00,240
ago uh but uh uh soon we realize that uh

108
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:03,359
we can move uh the Cannabis to the

109
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:07,960
medical use just with the education and

110
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,120
with the knowledge so we organized uh

111
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:12,000
Research Institute in Slovenia and we

112
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,319
started to organize education for

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,879
doctors and nurses because you want if

114
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:22,759
we want to uh bring the Cannabis into

115
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:25,680
practice I think we need the

116
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:29,319
knowledgeable uh

117
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,918
professionals and uh if we start to you

118
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:34,400
know start to teach them today we will

119
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,560
have first professionals like in 15

120
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,318
years from

121
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:42,280
now

122
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:45,680
great all right um so we are in this

123
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:47,839
very interesting and unique time in uh

124
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,600
the the history of the the world and

125
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:53,079
here in Europe in that we have been for

126
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,439
the last 80 plus years in a period of

127
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:58,198
prohibition on a plant with an

128
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:01,319
incredible amount of potential to impact

129
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:04,639
human health and a variety of other uses

130
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:09,080
uh research has been constrained to very

131
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:11,720
very limited narrow uh focuses and uh in

132
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:14,159
many ways has been underfunded and and

133
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,199
not carried out nearly as robustly as

134
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,840
the plant deserves and we're coming out

135
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:22,120
of the backside of that now uh emerging

136
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:24,439
from what has been maybe a bit of folk

137
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,918
medicine and cottage industry into an

138
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:29,719
opportunity to sort of come back up and

139
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:33,000
address this at the level of

140
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,280
professional industry that it merits and

141
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,279
so what I'd like to do is ask um my

142
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:41,079
panelists what you feel is perhaps one

143
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:44,439
of the the most needed or prioritized

144
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:47,959
areas of cannabis research that you feel

145
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:50,719
should be emphasize moving forward and

146
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:55,439
we'll start with you

147
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:59,599
Franchesco well um I mean in these last

148
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:03,160
years we saw a lot of research going on

149
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:06,719
on the two main compounds produced from

150
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:11,400
the cannabis plant like obviously CBD

151
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:15,560
and THC uh we saw a boom in the market

152
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:17,478
as well on you know products that were

153
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:22,680
not properly

154
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:26,199
Medical but used from people as well for

155
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:29,680
medical purposes you know uh but for the

156
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:31,560
future instead we have I mean the the

157
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,360
cannabis plant is unique in these

158
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:38,038
aspects because produces a lot of

159
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,919
compounds we've studied very very few of

160
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:43,079
them until now there going to be a lot

161
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,918
of research done on minor cannabinoids

162
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:47,318
for sure in the future and that's going

163
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:51,519
to be a lot of new canab noids that are

164
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:54,280
going to be discovered okay on top we

165
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:57,120
need to address as well that the

166
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:59,758
cannabis plant is and the compounds the

167
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,639
secondary metabolites in general we are

168
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:06,240
talking about flavonoids we're talking

169
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:10,560
about Turpin but these compounds are

170
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:13,960
alive even when you cut the plant so

171
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:19,360
there's a fermentation process going on

172
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:23,878
there after curing for months okay so

173
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:26,720
actually the compound changes over time

174
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:29,759
okay and is a base of we can say

175
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,000
fermentation for example okay so in a

176
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,560
matter of turpins for example there's

177
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,519
turpins that are unique to the cannabis

178
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:41,119
plant and that turpins that are

179
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:43,399
unique after the fermentation and exist

180
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,360
only in the cannabis plant for example

181
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:49,039
this is a topic super interesting and

182
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:52,519
we've been researching in Canada this

183
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:55,000
for a little while but for example for

184
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:57,720
the future this is going to be super

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,839
interesting venue uh

186
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:04,120
unfortunately uh we like I said earlier

187
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:07,200
on uh we have a different model so we

188
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:10,360
try to actually bring to the market

189
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,600
right away our research okay with our

190
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,600
partners we try

191
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:21,159
to monetize okay to bring the research

192
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:24,799
further because investments in research

193
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:29,679
on these topics are really you know not

194
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:33,479
enough okay CU funds Edge funds capital

195
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:37,000
is looking for quick profit and research

196
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:40,399
for medical proposes is for the benefit

197
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,600
of the Society of the wellbeing of the

198
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,078
people so it's is a total different

199
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,440
approach a totally different philosophy

200
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:52,799
than the capital uh you know approach of

201
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:54,839
the finance and on the B business let's

202
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,120
say you know so we we're looking about

203
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,360
Healthcare and we're looking about

204
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,959
business we try to bring bring the

205
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,200
things together that's why uh our

206
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:07,838
approach trying to is trying to monetize

207
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:11,519
is trying to you know uh self sustain

208
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:15,680
itself over time to you know expand

209
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:20,399
research in order to um find new

210
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:22,958
compounds find new applications for uh

211
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,278
you know patients and you know for like

212
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:28,039
I said the well-being of the society at

213
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:31,399
the end of the day great um yeah

214
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:34,919
certainly uh business as usual isn't

215
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:36,480
necessarily a model that um we can adopt

216
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:40,120
moving forward to realize all the

217
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,959
potential what about um uh AIA you you

218
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,120
work directly inside the pharmaceutical

219
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:46,119
industry so you have more of an

220
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,959
Insider's view um when Franchesco talks

221
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,600
about the minor canabo or these other

222
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:52,599
elements that um have potential medical

223
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,040
application and value what's the

224
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,959
interest um from within the

225
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:59,519
pharmaceutical industry in researching

226
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:02,159
and and maybe developing uh products

227
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,000
based on on those other constituents and

228
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,439
compounds that you're aware of yeah so

229
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,440
we do I do have the joy and the pleasure

230
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,880
to actually have these conversations

231
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:16,880
with pharmaceutical companies day in day

232
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:19,360
out and um it is a very interesting

233
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,439
shift in mind mindset that's happening

234
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,600
right now it used to be a question of

235
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,959
big Pharma like oh this is cannabis

236
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,519
we're not sure how do we know what is

237
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,278
actually working and what is not and

238
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:33,799
this is changing Ing and what is very

239
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:37,679
interesting to note I'd say in terms of

240
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:40,000
what um the research is focusing on so

241
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:44,000
minors and combinations but when we

242
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,200
think combinations is our um our API in

243
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,639
combination with an existing medicine so

244
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,959
an existing approved treatment that

245
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,959
could help amplify its impact that could

246
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:57,838
also help reduce side effects and so on

247
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:59,559
secondly uh the patient Centric formats

248
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,959
we should all be aware that with the

249
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:04,319
knowledge and the technology that was

250
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:07,039
available in the time being able to

251
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,079
dissolve CBD in oil was the best

252
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:12,559
possible Solution that's no longer the

253
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:14,879
case we have solutions that are

254
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,439
particularly applicable for patient

255
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,720
convenience and patient compliance and

256
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,800
reducing variability and these could be

257
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,480
solid formats like an orally dispersable

258
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:27,958
tablet like a chewable tablet like

259
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,199
topicals and patients are asking for

260
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:32,479
that and we should be um we should be

261
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:34,240
answering that and we at DSM fir Minish

262
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,278
are actually developing some of these

263
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,879
formulations but we also see great um

264
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:42,240
applications from other parts of the

265
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:44,519
world and then a last area so when I

266
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,440
talk to to Pharma companies what do they

267
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,519
ask for and I think that's what we all

268
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,760
need to be aware of they will there are

269
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:54,679
two elements that will always come back

270
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:56,519
IP and Pharma standards so IP I think is

271
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:58,958
a no-brainer I've seen a lot of good

272
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,600
work around patents across our industry

273
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:03,759
but Pharma standards is something we

274
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,079
need to double down on because when

275
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,759
you're starting a development of a new

276
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:10,599
pharmaceutical product and short on cast

277
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:12,838
there's often a desire to limit costs

278
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,639
and that's understandable but making

279
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:16,720
discounts on the wrong things is going

280
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,360
to make your product an unattractive

281
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,320
investment down the line and it's even

282
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,039
more going to put patients at risk which

283
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,120
is not something that nobody wants so

284
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:27,759
starting right from the right ingredient

285
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,320
with the right standards with the right

286
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,679
certifications

287
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,079
all the way down to not just GMP and I

288
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:37,078
think we should be honest there is a bit

289
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:39,120
of a confusion on what GMP is being

290
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:41,278
manufactured in a GMP facility is a

291
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,679
prerequisite it's not sufficient by

292
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:46,879
itself there is a set of quality

293
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:49,958
standards and PHA prerequisites and

294
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,958
Purity uh data and stability data and

295
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:54,159
how you design your clinical trial that

296
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:56,159
you need to think in advance CU what is

297
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,519
the risk that you find yourself at the

298
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,319
end of the process of 3 years and you've

299
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:03,320
made a discount that actually now means

300
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,639
nobody wants to invest in your product

301
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,480
and who's losing people who invested in

302
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,600
you your time your money the patient

303
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,959
who's never going to get it so I think

304
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,600
we definitely need to have a wider

305
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:18,758
understanding on how we approach this ah

306
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,120
indeed and certainly uh companies that

307
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:24,320
are looking to place their products in

308
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,879
the traditional pharmaceutical model um

309
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,079
would be wise to to know beforehand

310
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,838
exactly what they're going to have to do

311
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:35,399
in order to have a better chance of

312
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:38,320
success um moar you've um worked with uh

313
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:40,159
a number of different uh you've worked

314
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,040
from your medical clinic over the years

315
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:45,879
providing cannabis and different forms

316
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:49,000
of uh delivery to patients but outside

317
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:52,679
of the pharmaceutical model um do you

318
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,919
believe that there's a place uh for uh

319
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:58,239
research and development in the kind of

320
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,159
the other sort of medical applications

321
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,720
that don't follow the strict sort of

322
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:04,838
pharmaceutical model and standards and

323
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:09,600
what would that look like for

324
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:12,880
you uh yeah I think that as atasia said

325
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,560
there must come to change of the mindset

326
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:18,240
of Pharma industry because cannabis

327
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:21,638
works completely on different way than

328
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:26,799
the certain remedies that are on uh the

329
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:32,759
market now uh yes we we were following

330
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:35,439
patients uh also not just uh uh as a

331
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:37,959
patient but also we followed what they

332
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,240
used how they used all the possible

333
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:44,359
applications so through the year we have

334
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:49,198
a lot of uh let's say experience and

335
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:52,879
knowledge uh but I think that uh on

336
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:56,479
the research that is providing by Pharma

337
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:59,838
industry now uh the Pharma is I think on

338
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:03,720
the complete wrong way because uh they

339
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:05,680
want to Let's this is the Pharma mindset

340
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,959
I think they want to develop drug which

341
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:14,679
will help for a certain condition and uh

342
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:17,119
I think we should uh adjust the dosage

343
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:19,679
and everything to human endocannabinoid

344
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,000
system so we can stimulate it on the

345
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,439
best way not for the certain disease but

346
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,919
uh for

347
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,959
the uh soall uh personal medicine

348
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:34,278
personalized medicine I think this is

349
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:37,879
the future yeah okay very different

350
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:40,000
approaches but um with uh similar kinds

351
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:42,639
of goals in terms of outcomes yeah I I

352
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,958
will I will add as well that obviously

353
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,879
the tayor made that's why is very

354
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:51,879
different than the pharmaceutical like

355
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:55,159
standardized product okay you cannot

356
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:58,318
think about Canabis an application uh

357
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:59,519
with cannabis plant itself and is

358
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:03,439
extract

359
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:06,279
as uh any other pharmaceutical existing

360
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:10,120
in the industry okay the thing is if you

361
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:12,639
take a cannabinoid okay then you

362
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:15,239
synthetize it so you make it P

363
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,600
proprietary technology you patent it

364
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:21,199
because it's no longer nature and then

365
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:24,318
you find something that is working on

366
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,318
that molecule which is no longer nature

367
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:28,599
then you can have a standardized product

368
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:31,879
but it's not sure that we work on each

369
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:35,879
and every one of us okay instead exactly

370
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:39,720
the approach of somebody that it's been

371
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:42,480
close to the patients can actually

372
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,400
reveal how the pharmaceutical

373
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,120
developments on the Cannabis needs to be

374
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,519
made which is the tailor made medicine

375
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:54,479
so we can give the

376
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:57,480
pharmacists not a prepared drug okay cuz

377
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,400
this is why the regulation is like this

378
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,919
at the end of the day and our would like

379
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,919
the the regulation on the medical

380
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,640
cannabis to stick like this and just

381
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:09,480
move on on the research side because

382
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:12,759
pharmacist is are so important at this

383
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:16,200
point because and obviously doctors

384
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:19,400
because we need to adjust the dosage as

385
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,640
well to each and every one of us the

386
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,759
endoc carabid system as well The

387
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:27,759
receptors because each and every one of

388
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:31,440
us has a different uh level of reaction

389
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:34,200
to uh the cannabinoids and as well uh

390
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,960
the endocannabinoid

391
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:40,759
similar that are produced by our own

392
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:43,240
body okay so there's three levels where

393
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:45,480
you need to look when you are

394
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,720
prescribing or where when are you

395
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,759
preparing a formulation for a patient in

396
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,279
the in the Cannabis you know space so

397
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:58,440
it's not easy that's why it's so

398
00:18:54,279 --> 00:19:02,200
difficult to educate Physicians okay and

399
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:06,279
obvious ly another thing is that the

400
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:09,640
endoc cannabinoid system interacts with

401
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:13,480
pretty much every disease that we can

402
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,400
have all right so this means that can of

403
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,679
be

404
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,880
mimic we can actually interact with our

405
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:25,400
endoc carabid system with compounds that

406
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:27,760
are similar to carabids and as well tpin

407
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:31,200
and as well flavonoids and as well you

408
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:34,798
know protein and and uh amino acids so

409
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:38,640
it's very very you know tailor made a

410
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:42,119
person uh likes strawberry another lemon

411
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:45,679
you cannot uh that's why uh for example

412
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:48,479
France is moving on the right way uh on

413
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,038
the Cannabis medicine because they

414
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,720
flowers

415
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:55,798
are can is not possible to standardize a

416
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,919
flour okay so they are allowing on the

417
00:19:55,798 --> 00:20:02,158
medical side just the oils okay because

418
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:04,720
is easier to get datas on the oils

419
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,960
because the flowers are so complicated

420
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,679
they just said okay let's get rid of

421
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,960
this so let's let's stop there for just

422
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:14,798
a moment cuz that's an interesting uh

423
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,400
place to to um maybe bring in Christian

424
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:19,158
uh here into the conversation there's a

425
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,038
real emphasis whether it's in the

426
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:24,480
pharmaceutical model or whether it's in

427
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:26,759
sort of the the um extent medical model

428
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,599
to having a standardized or consistent

429
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:31,558
product right and yet the Cannabis by

430
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,319
its nature is this very it's a plant

431
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:35,200
with a lot of plasticity expressed very

432
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:37,439
differently depending on the epigenetic

433
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,000
conditions so is there something from a

434
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,320
cultivator point of view that you think

435
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,038
in terms of research could um help

436
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:47,839
create a more consistent standardized

437
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:50,038
product that would be of use um in both

438
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:52,798
the pharmaceutical and the the more

439
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:57,319
traditional medical

440
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:59,240
model well Justin um I mean this is what

441
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:01,240
what is uh demanded even by the

442
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,679
regulatory framework we have uh if you

443
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,200
are going into the medical purpose of

444
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,519
course we have to go into control

445
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,278
conditions more control we have you know

446
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:13,240
um and more more you're focusing on one

447
00:21:09,278 --> 00:21:15,960
genotype um more we can we can calculate

448
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,960
and predict what the outcome will be

449
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,798
however we are talking about a

450
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,400
bioproduct you know and the bioproduct

451
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:23,119
is still so diverse so tailor made

452
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,000
medicine um is so much in the future

453
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:28,599
when it comes to you know to bioproducts

454
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,200
which uh where all of the components if

455
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:31,678
affect each other as you pointed out I

456
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,440
mean the Entourage effect is something

457
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,159
which we don't understand yet we can we

458
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,840
have just bits and pieces of our

459
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:40,760
understanding here therefore um I think

460
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:42,959
that that from our Growers perspective

461
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:44,798
we are working on and we are getting

462
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,798
much better understanding now on on the

463
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:49,400
plant I mean there's a lot of companies

464
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:51,278
now who can produce Canabis but uh

465
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,320
they're all struggling you know even

466
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:56,319
within the production system um um on on

467
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:58,759
certain issues which will affect the

468
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:00,200
secondary MBL composition as well as the

469
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:04,158
amount of secondary metabolites which

470
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:06,798
are bioactive so uh I see both ways in

471
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,919
the future I mean the one is of course

472
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:11,480
going stronger into the medical part

473
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:13,320
where we really try to understand in the

474
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,480
beginning individual components then we

475
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:17,439
start combining components you know to

476
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,240
understand what is the the medical

477
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,000
effect here and we have seen this in

478
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,759
other products which have not been you

479
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,839
know so much stigmatized but when I look

480
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:27,440
into salic lates it's the same same

481
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:29,199
effect here um until we came up to a

482
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,440
product like aspirine you know but uh

483
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,798
still there is a market in addition to

484
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,120
the whole product and uh this will be

485
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:36,519
something which we will have also in the

486
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:38,879
future here with with

487
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:40,359
Canabis just a quick reaction to this

488
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,320
because I I what I really like about

489
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,639
this panel it kind of reflects the

490
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,519
industry we have completely different

491
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,320
parts in completely different groups and

492
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:50,359
people with different interests which is

493
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,960
great because a polyphony of Interest

494
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:55,439
means a polyphony of research you know

495
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,038
Avenues and I honestly do believe there

496
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,240
is space for very different segments and

497
00:22:58,038 --> 00:23:02,278
very different different products so

498
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,798
long as we are clear what is the need we

499
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:07,079
are trying to meet here what do I mean I

500
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:09,519
live in Amsterdam there is a regulated

501
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:12,720
recreational Market Works fantastically

502
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:15,599
well right there is space for that type

503
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,000
of product in that type of market then

504
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:20,319
we are seeing more and more of the

505
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,240
Cosmetics food supplements there is

506
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:24,720
space for that market for people who

507
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,278
want to have a day-to-day functional

508
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,440
benefit there is space for the medical

509
00:23:27,278 --> 00:23:31,119
cannabis Market as it is is evolving and

510
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,880
then there is the pharmaceutical

511
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:37,479
development which is meant to be a

512
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:40,360
product um that has been tested and

513
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,079
proven and we know it works for the vast

514
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:44,558
majority of patients with a specific

515
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:46,558
disease and can be prescribed based on

516
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:50,480
evidence knowledge and and the

517
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:53,918
confidence of the physician and so where

518
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,720
I am seeing that what my experience has

519
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,600
been in this space is we're trying we're

520
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,919
mixing things up and that is not helping

521
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:04,558
us because it doesn't help us explain to

522
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,440
the end consumer or the patient what

523
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,480
kind of need we're meeting with our

524
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,519
product we can't be everything to

525
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,798
everyone and and if we try to do that in

526
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:15,158
the end we will end up with more

527
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,639
confusion and everything that comes from

528
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:19,320
the cannabis plant is going to be

529
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,159
bundled under I don't understand kind of

530
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:25,119
area and that's where I would like to

531
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:26,559
caution us to be able to speak to what

532
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:28,158
is the need we want to meet and what is

533
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:30,678
the pathway we want to follow so we

534
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,159
chose the pharmaceutical pathway cuz we

535
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:33,960
have a lot of experience in that and we

536
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,200
are convinced that once something is

537
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,600
proven it can be reimbursed it can

538
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,600
actually be easy to access for a number

539
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:42,879
of patients that doesn't mean it is the

540
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:45,678
only way that it means that so long as

541
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,600
we all understand and probably what we

542
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:51,038
should be investing in is the library of

543
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:53,879
knowledge a bit of a structured

544
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:56,798
organized way of understanding

545
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,080
documenting and uh proving the benefit

546
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:00,798
of different parts of the plan and

547
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:03,119
different uses I love that term a

548
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:05,440
library of knowledge uh and something

549
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:08,199
that um has been unfortunately a little

550
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,159
bit impoverished over these Decades of

551
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,840
prohibition because we haven't been able

552
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,720
to effectively address uh the research

553
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:17,158
need to be done and create a language

554
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:21,200
that contextualizes everything in sort

555
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:24,480
of the path or Lane uh that segment that

556
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:27,960
it would be uh appropriately placed in

557
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:31,240
so when we look at the the landscape of

558
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:34,600
cannabis This research moving forward uh

559
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:37,880
I'm curious what you all see as um

560
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:41,319
obstacles that we'll need to overcome uh

561
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:43,799
I've heard people speak to the stigma of

562
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:45,439
um working with cannabis uh we're

563
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:47,038
speaking to not being able to

564
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,000
differentiate the segments and the

565
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:51,319
different approaches in the context of

566
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,759
application um so I saw you nod your

567
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:53,918
head first Christian I I'll give you

568
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,480
first shot at this I think I'm going to

569
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,000
get everybody here on the panel a shot

570
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,519
of this what are the obstacles that you

571
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,119
feel like um we need to overcome and and

572
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:04,558
briefly how might we do that well

573
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:06,439
talking about obstacles it's always a

574
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:09,678
money first but this is not what I want

575
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,558
to mention here uh now the for me the

576
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,159
stigma is really one of the the biggest

577
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:15,158
obstacles I have lots of colleagues who

578
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:16,840
are working with cannabis and research

579
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:19,200
and they do not publish papers and they

580
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:20,439
don't talk about it you know because

581
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,798
still we are coming from a different

582
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,798
generation and uh it's still in the mind

583
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:29,079
of of in the mindset of many people um

584
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:31,240
when I uh we we open a lab a cannabis

585
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:33,000
lab now at the University but when my

586
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,839
president comes she doesn't want to get

587
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,278
a picture because she's a politician of

588
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:38,558
course you know she doesn't want to

589
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:40,720
become involved in in in this too much

590
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:42,839
she's more Curious oh we are working now

591
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,079
in Canabis at the University now that's

592
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:46,839
kind of strange you know uh we'll see

593
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:48,079
what what the politics in Germany bring

594
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:50,240
and I think this is something which we

595
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:52,678
have to really overcome that's one part

596
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,640
and the second one is you know um in the

597
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:56,759
moment research is very much within the

598
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,559
companies so research and development is

599
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:01,839
within companies and they are you know

600
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:03,398
have of course their own interest they

601
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:05,639
protect their their research they are

602
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:07,599
not willing to share among you know but

603
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,200
what what we need is not only a database

604
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:14,038
of knowledge you know we need also a

605
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:16,600
solid ground um for you know for getting

606
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:18,359
uh rid of all of those stigmatization

607
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:20,359
and uh I think this is something where

608
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:21,798
where the public needs to jump in in

609
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:23,558
open markets and markets which are

610
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:26,558
getting now like in Germany are open

611
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:28,480
more open and start supporting and this

612
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:30,759
is the money part you know supporting

613
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,159
public research so that we have all kind

614
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:35,240
of a of a minimal Baseline and then it

615
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:40,519
you know the rest can be differentiated

616
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:41,839
between companies great um AIA is there

617
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:45,759
something that you'd like to add on or

618
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:48,278
we could go to badar no I always have

619
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:50,679
something no I think I already talked

620
00:27:48,278 --> 00:27:52,759
about the patient Centric formats I

621
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:55,240
think that's number one patient

622
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:57,000
acceptance will increase the

623
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:00,200
prescription will increase the use and

624
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,880
will help reduce among other things one

625
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,840
more thing that from a formulation

626
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,600
perspective is important to look at is

627
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:09,678
the biovailability challenge with many

628
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:11,398
of these cannabinoids uh we all know CBD

629
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,640
many other cannabinoids have very low

630
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:17,239
bioavailability very low absorption

631
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:19,480
because of um first pass metabolism and

632
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,200
incomplete absorption in in the gastric

633
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:24,120
root so what are we doing about that how

634
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,319
can we actually make sure that the

635
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:29,199
patient takes enough of the of the

636
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:31,079
medicine that is going to be good for

637
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,759
them but not more than what they need

638
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:36,199
and that it is effective so here we at

639
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:38,798
DSM for Minish have been working on that

640
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,159
and are aiming to have um we're putting

641
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:44,679
actually a clinical trial together this

642
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:47,120
summer to test an improved bability uh

643
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:48,840
formulation but we need more of that

644
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:50,759
everyone thinking together I'm sure

645
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:54,319
there are lots of Technologies out there

646
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:57,119
that have that aspiration eventually and

647
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,558
finally something that's not um that's

648
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:00,319
not an obstacle

649
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:03,359
internally so I think viability is an

650
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:06,119
internal obstacle intrinsic to our work

651
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:08,439
one that I think is extrinsic is um

652
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:10,839
regulation legislation being built

653
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:14,558
without full understanding so I think

654
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:17,319
our duty and our opportunity is to help

655
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:19,798
inform uh legislation based on the

656
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:22,158
research that we do right help the

657
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:24,278
legislator who's never met uh a

658
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,240
cannaboid medicine before make informed

659
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:28,359
decisions and there's a really good

660
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,038
example uh there's many but there's one

661
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:33,639
that sticks to mind in Me is from the

662
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:35,519
Lambert Institute in Australia where

663
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,360
there was a very specific question from

664
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,960
the regulator do the workers in the

665
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:44,240
mining and transportation industry in

666
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:46,679
Australia can they use medical cannabis

667
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,599
and come to work the next day so they

668
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:50,919
did an observational study and they

669
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:54,240
proven there is no problem with memory

670
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:56,480
with driving with anything they could

671
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,399
measure so actually the regulation came

672
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,640
out and said okay that is not not a

673
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:04,038
problem medical cannabis can be used in

674
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,360
the space and I think we can do a lot

675
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:07,679
more as well to help invest but that

676
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:09,439
shouldn't be only on us right it

677
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,080
shouldn't be only on the industry public

678
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,558
private Partnerships shared costs and a

679
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:17,319
shared understanding of if we are able

680
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:20,240
to prove that this medicine works and

681
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:23,240
actually helps relieve pain which is a

682
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,640
massive loss of quality of life how can

683
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:29,759
we get access to as many patients as

684
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,440
possible great really appreciate that um

685
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,640
B would you like to speak about either

686
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,558
the obstacles uh that you foresee to

687
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,799
research or perhaps the the need to

688
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:40,038
educate um decision makers and

689
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:42,839
stakeholders in the industry yes of

690
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:46,919
course uh bad legislation is always a

691
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:51,798
big obstacle for any research and uh uh

692
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:54,559
since uh very recent ago everything uh

693
00:30:51,798 --> 00:30:56,638
about cannabis was illegal you know I

694
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:59,759
think with the change of the legislation

695
00:30:56,638 --> 00:31:03,558
in Germany and other countries uh this

696
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:05,960
stigma will very quick disappeared and

697
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:08,440
uh uh cannabis will come to the

698
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:12,399
mainstream research because

699
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:15,880
people demand it you know patients are

700
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:18,398
very informed about cannabis and now

701
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:21,278
it's on the

702
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:24,678
professionals uh side to bring this to

703
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:26,960
life as soon as possible great

704
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:30,038
Franchesca do you think that there's a a

705
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,679
way that the the um the regulators and

706
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:35,960
the decision makers uh uh can be more

707
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,480
informed and more responsive to a

708
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:42,240
patient Centric approach to something

709
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,200
that considers uh you know really the

710
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,399
the

711
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,639
efficacy um in in an area that's outside

712
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:52,239
of their um experience outside of their

713
00:31:48,638 --> 00:31:55,439
wheelhouse um and how would you um like

714
00:31:52,240 --> 00:32:00,359
to see us approach that as an

715
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:03,278
industry well uh we we saw the European

716
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:06,240
Union last year made make a huge step

717
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:08,919
forward on cannabis research because

718
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,720
they actually the European Union said

719
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:14,880
okay let's invest in medical cannabis

720
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,519
research we we give him funds for the

721
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,480
medical cannabis

722
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:23,038
research uh as well I had the privilege

723
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:27,558
to work uh back in

724
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:32,000
2020 with the an in an ISO project that

725
00:32:27,558 --> 00:32:36,839
was was uh to create a standard for a

726
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:40,000
recreational Market in Europe okay so um

727
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:42,278
actually I see that the the long story

728
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,759
short we develop the standard there's an

729
00:32:42,278 --> 00:32:48,440
existing standard few people knows this

730
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:52,158
there's an existing standard ISO

731
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:56,798
so ISO say for international standard

732
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:58,519
organization is uh in Geneva I mean

733
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:00,839
hopefully everybody knows about this

734
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:02,919
because is every day in our lives

735
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:05,959
constantly these kind of standards and

736
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:08,720
regulations okay so we basically develop

737
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:12,278
the standard for an European

738
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:15,919
recreational Market how needs to be the

739
00:33:12,278 --> 00:33:21,919
you know the settings and developed but

740
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:26,360
still is isn't isn't approachable as um

741
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:28,840
to bring everybody together is uh uh not

742
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:31,638
applicable cuz simply everyone has a

743
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:35,000
different approach uh on in each and

744
00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:37,599
every country but I see the legislators

745
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,679
at this point moving forward toward

746
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:42,638
cannabis okay we tried on the

747
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,559
recreational doesn't worked so they

748
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:47,879
moved on the medical side and it's

749
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:51,200
working a lot because anyways we seen a

750
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:55,000
lot of projects going on as well funded

751
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:57,240
from you know public entities about the

752
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,960
about cannabis research so I'm very

753
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,519
positive about this unfortunately like I

754
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:06,120
said the institution is there but the

755
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:08,440
private sector not much simply because

756
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:10,960
of the financial issues the return on

757
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:14,599
investment so fast they want uh they

758
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:18,039
think like cannabis says uh cryptos uh

759
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:20,200
and you know so this sort of stigma on

760
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:23,279
the financial industry and on top

761
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:26,199
obviously there's a uh the problem of

762
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,760
some patients that really needs canab I

763
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:30,759
met a lot worldwide

764
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,760
the patients that really need cannabis

765
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,839
but they are afraid of using it they

766
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,839
never used it because of the prohibition

767
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:40,799
and everything obviously was not

768
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:44,039
accessible but now they actually have a

769
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:48,480
problem because I cannot solve it cuz

770
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:50,559
they using paliative medicine uh but

771
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,719
what if they use cannabis it will be

772
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:54,639
much better for them CU there's no or

773
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:59,199
very little side effects compared to the

774
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:03,760
traditional medicine all right so um

775
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:06,159
I believe that we can move forward fast

776
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:10,200
I believe that we can move forward fast

777
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:14,440
if the finance uh sector is going to

778
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:17,838
invest in research in pharmaceutical and

779
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:20,920
we have the backup of the institution so

780
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:23,400
we can do a lot of great work over here

781
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:27,039
in Europe but as well I saw companies in

782
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:30,680
Canada getting Millions for research and

783
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:33,039
is is exciting you know for on the

784
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:35,598
medical aspects it's very very exciting

785
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:38,599
so I hope that we can get to that point

786
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:41,320
as well over here in Europe cooperating

787
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:44,240
with institutions like universities

788
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:48,240
private sector companies

789
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:51,279
so this is going to be uh the future

790
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:53,439
great appreciate that yeah we can see

791
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,440
here from the discussion today that it's

792
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,838
a complex sometimes convoluted landscape

793
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:02,039
um as we emerge out out of the

794
00:35:58,838 --> 00:36:05,719
prohibition era and um and the different

795
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:07,318
interests that uh that have influence on

796
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:11,639
where cannabis research is being

797
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:14,639
directed and to what end uh so sometimes

798
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:16,960
it it it feels like a lot to try and

799
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,759
overcome but at the same time there's a

800
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,280
lot to be excited about I think we are

801
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,800
finding now that there is going to be

802
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,599
new models of uh public and private

803
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:29,119
partnership that will come together to

804
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:31,800
um invest into research that's needed

805
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:35,838
and and so in the spirit of kind of also

806
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:38,880
looking at what's possible and what's uh

807
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:40,599
you know it's what's exciting and what

808
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,358
creates optimism in the space I'd like

809
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:44,800
to give each of you guys a chance to

810
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:47,838
speak to just something in the world of

811
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,318
cannaboid or cannabis research um that

812
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:52,239
you're aware of now that's kind of a

813
00:36:49,318 --> 00:36:53,920
Cutting Edge and an exciting thing um

814
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:55,479
that really gets you fired up and that

815
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,838
you'd like to share with our audience

816
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:59,480
here and we'll start with you down there

817
00:36:56,838 --> 00:37:02,880
badar

818
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:06,480
uh yeah cannabis is the most actually uh

819
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:10,880
research plant on the planet with 50,000

820
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:15,280
studies about it I think uh but I think

821
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:18,480
uh we need more um let's say not that

822
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:22,119
high science but the uh something that

823
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,838
it would bring cannabis uh more towards

824
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:27,800
doctors you know they need not high

825
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:31,639
science but they need the protocols they

826
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:33,599
need uh applications methods uh they

827
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:36,719
need uh right

828
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:39,039
dosages uh and this is uh what is

829
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:41,399
actually missing because until we don't

830
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:44,838
have this the doctors is I don't know

831
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:47,920
this is my opinion from Slovenian uh

832
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:51,719
aspect uh it will not come to the

833
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:55,800
general use uh among the Medicals in the

834
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:58,639
medical system got it so uh education of

835
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:01,079
healthc Care Professionals and and in in

836
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:04,960
that sort of field there um development

837
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:07,079
of that is is a a piece that you see in

838
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,639
um the ex the support and extension of

839
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:12,359
cannabis research that's exciting yes

840
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:16,039
and I should also I think that uh

841
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:19,799
the canab theology should be part of the

842
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:21,880
curriculum in the medical uh faculties

843
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:25,160
and all other professional schools

844
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:27,519
because without the educated

845
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:28,879
professionals it will never be a part of

846
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:32,599
of the mainstream

847
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,519
medicine got it thank you uh what about

848
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:36,960
you AOS here what do you see out on the

849
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:40,400
horizons of cannabis research that you

850
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:43,480
find um exciting uh or inspiring on the

851
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:46,400
horizon so immediately I'm very very

852
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,480
excited about the premium formulated CBD

853
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,639
powder we're bringing to the market

854
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,039
because we are talking enhanced bi

855
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:55,480
availability solid formats patient

856
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:57,400
Centric formats and increased API

857
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,960
loading we're talking enabling res

858
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:02,200
search on a different level but okay

859
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,400
that is for now on the longer on the

860
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:07,199
time frame on the longer time frame I

861
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,680
really um am encouraged and hopeful to

862
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:12,239
see that some countries are enabling

863
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:14,239
regulation that is helping the

864
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:16,879
traditional way we've had to learn in

865
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:19,519
this industry on how the plant works

866
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,119
from observational data from Real World

867
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:23,759
evidence from case studies which is not

868
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:26,240
something that normally farmer would

869
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,440
accept as part of a weighin this is

870
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:31,598
becoming part of informing how we will

871
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,880
do pharmaceutical development and how it

872
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,680
will work practical example what's

873
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,559
happening in Brazil you can bring a

874
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:40,199
product to the cannaboid product to the

875
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:42,039
market you have to demonstrate quality

876
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:44,358
and safety and you have five years to do

877
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:46,358
a clinical trial what happens in those

878
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:48,639
five years the Physicians learn which

879
00:39:46,358 --> 00:39:51,598
indication it works best which patient

880
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:54,039
population it works best the legislator

881
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,720
is learning which of these products are

882
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:59,119
actually uh best to use and which ones

883
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:01,519
are not foring to the promise 5 years

884
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,720
down the line you have a well-designed

885
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:05,639
clinical trial that can show benefit in

886
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:07,679
the right patient population and you

887
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:09,400
have full Market access this is not

888
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:11,118
something we've been used to in the

889
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,440
pharmaceutical sector and I think it is

890
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,240
a wonderful step forward that some big

891
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,960
countries and big markets are working on

892
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:20,118
it oh that's exciting still the

893
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,079
formulated CBD powder is more exciting

894
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:25,599
so the change of the

895
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,760
mindset Shameless plugs are are welcomed

896
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:31,079
all right um Christian what about you

897
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,920
where do you see uh the horizons of

898
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:35,318
cannabis research in in the fields that

899
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:38,280
you're um involved in that are exciting

900
00:40:35,318 --> 00:40:40,079
and inspiring for you well there there

901
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,599
are two different approaches uh the one

902
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,200
is um and I've heard today in in

903
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:46,079
different panels uh that we are all

904
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:48,199
going when it comes to medical cannabis

905
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,680
under really controlled conditions but I

906
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:51,598
think we are going now under semic

907
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:53,759
controlled conditions um and we are

908
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,680
having new technologies using lots of

909
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,160
sensors to manipulate the plant during

910
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:00,199
the production process so that we really

911
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:04,399
can forecast what the quality is uh what

912
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:06,598
the THC content is uh and we are able to

913
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,358
um find the right algorithms during our

914
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:14,200
production system you know um that that

915
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:16,519
we can um yeah create a plant a Model A

916
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:20,439
plant which is then maybe the first step

917
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:22,639
to a tailor you know medicine tailor

918
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,000
personalized medicine when it comes to a

919
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:27,078
complete bio product uh so I think this

920
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,239
is really uh something which I'm looking

921
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:31,800
for forward um and and we are learning a

922
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:34,118
lot in in the last years even the second

923
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:36,240
part is we are combining now systems in

924
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:38,519
in Horticulture um you know everything

925
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:40,039
should be more sustainable because

926
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:41,559
agriculture Horticulture is of course a

927
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:43,800
lot of under pressure when it comes to

928
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:46,000
climate change and all of this and so

929
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,318
hot sustainability plays a major role

930
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,159
and uh combined farming system so where

931
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:53,318
we use uh not only produce a plant for

932
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:55,480
for one product where we use the full

933
00:41:53,318 --> 00:41:57,920
plant where we combine it uh to save

934
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,960
energy and so on this is something which

935
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,680
uh is really inspiring and we are we are

936
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,559
running a project where we combine

937
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:06,719
different production systems and

938
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:08,559
cannabis is only one part of it where uh

939
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,159
where we work for the uh for the medical

940
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:14,159
industry but we fully use the plant for

941
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:17,358
um everything else you know to feed uh

942
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:18,799
uh to as as a fiber um um and so on so

943
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:20,318
lots of different products which are

944
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,160
coming here and I think this is really

945
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:24,960
really interesting to see what's going

946
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:27,719
on how many people are interested in

947
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,358
Canabis that is a great reminder that

948
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:33,318
there's often times such a hyperfocus on

949
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:35,039
you know the particular canabo or

950
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:36,599
compounds as a result that you find in

951
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:37,960
the infloresence and the flowers and so

952
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:40,559
much of the rest of the impact of the

953
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,519
plant and its life cycle and the other

954
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:43,519
constituents in the plant are forgotten

955
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:47,079
in these

956
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:51,280
conversations and you know I'm reminded

957
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:54,760
that uh in crop rotation with uh wheat

958
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,839
and corn hemp has shown uh 18% increase

959
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,440
in yields in winter wheat for example

960
00:42:56,838 --> 00:43:01,440
just by being in rotation so when you're

961
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:05,240
talking about using the plant and multi-

962
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:07,358
um uh multiproduct systems right

963
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:09,959
producing more than just the Cannabis

964
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:12,598
simple things like crop rotation uh have

965
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,880
been a part of the the process that has

966
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:16,280
been forgotten because we weren't

967
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,920
allowed to plant cannabis for I was

968
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,519
thinking even about completely different

969
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,159
production systems like combining it

970
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:24,159
with aquaculture we can use leftovers

971
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:26,118
from from the medical industry as a

972
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:27,879
protein source for aquaculture as a part

973
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:29,160
of fish feed that's you know this is

974
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,680
something completely different you know

975
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:32,879
which most people have not in mind but

976
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:35,480
if you start looking into nature where

977
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,119
you know where the whole plant is used

978
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,838
you know and and there's never when when

979
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:41,800
when you produce something there's never

980
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:43,519
waste the term waste does not exist in

981
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,920
nature so you know everything which is a

982
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:48,519
leftover which is not used by one system

983
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,920
can be used by someone else so uh and we

984
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:51,719
have uh lots of different production

985
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,920
systems which we can combine thinking

986
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:56,279
about insects you know fantastic protein

987
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:59,200
source for maybe the future protein for

988
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:02,000
humans so insect production is is

989
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:05,358
emerging field like cannabis you know

990
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,239
and uh the cannabis plant as a whole is

991
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:11,318
fantastic

992
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:12,598

right so we're about ready to wrap up

994
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:16,400
Franchesca this is your chance to to

995
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,159
speak to something that you see on the

996
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:22,400
horizon that's inspiring

997
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:25,639
well keep I mean yeah I keep I give I'll

998
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:29,000
try to keep it long story short uh yeah

999
00:44:25,639 --> 00:44:31,000
uh so uh in immediate future there's a

1000
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,400
really interesting Nano

1001
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:37,199
formulation that is coming up combined

1002
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,720
with other Botanical compounds so

1003
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:44,239
totally natural

1004
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:48,078
medicine uh for patients there a huge

1005
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:51,239
project to bring uh uh you know

1006
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:53,640
compounds uh with fiber as well cuz this

1007
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:56,799
is underrated over here everybody speaks

1008
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:59,799
about the medical use pharmaceutical use

1009
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:02,720
but the amp industry is very underrated

1010
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,400
and that this is really the Cannabis

1011
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:06,919
industry should be really the Cannabis

1012
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,400
industry so if you guys uh don't want to

1013
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:10,240
invest because it's too risky to

1014
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,039
pharmaceutical industry then invest in

1015
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:17,519
amp industry guys textile

1016
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:21,239
