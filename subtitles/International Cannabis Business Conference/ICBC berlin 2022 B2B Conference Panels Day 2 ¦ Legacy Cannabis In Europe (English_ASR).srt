1
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:11,439
okay today we're talking about cannabis

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,000
legendary uh cannabis legacy is uh

3
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,919
something which is not always lovely

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,440
outcomes electricity although it also

5
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:20,160
has something with the future of

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,880
countries so please

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,518
allow me to also give an outlook on the

8
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,358
future of cannabis in that uh here in

9
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,439
that panel it's not only about the

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,800
history of cannabis but of course i

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,799
think we start with the history of

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,480
cannabis because we have two very

13
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,320
experienced

14
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,839
players from the cannabis injuries

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,799
industry here

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,280
we have

17
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:44,479

much but it is so nice you know

114

121
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,399
know about thailand what happened

122
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,000
my son allen teach entitlement on two

123
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,599
universities

124
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,800
already a couple of years i think three

125
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,720
years and he got an honorable doctorate

126
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,040
in september from the university so

127
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,960
that's he teach campus

128
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,319
and he was also on the barricade to

129
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,159
legalize

130
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,439
happy what happened in thailand it's

131
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,680
amazing ah this is this is so beautiful

132
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,719
this is happening which we did flags

133
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,879
right

134
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,400
and it's so sad and it's a little bit on

135
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:06,000
it because hemprex helped his future and

136
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,599
no doubt about it

137
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,800
we have a company in holland for 27

138
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,560
years

139
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,319
25 years we lost that money a lot

140
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,560
and now finally we've made some money

141
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,879
especially with the cbd

142
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,199
and because of code and all the other

143
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,560
things is going down again but now we

144
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:29,199
make the insulation factory just uh two

145
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,519
years open two and a half and the

146
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,759
insulation is amazing you know all the

147
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,519
glass will the wrong rule

148
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,080
all the pollution they put out and the

149
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,240
energy it takes to produce it and now we

150
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,639
got this hemp wool and this

151
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,000
hemp insulation and the crazy thing i

152
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,240
never knew

153
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,240
we isolate for

154
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,800
cold here in europe and it's cold we

155
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,519
isolate good and then we're not cold

156
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,079
but hemp is not only for the cold it

157
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,758
protects much much better than

158
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,159
uh glass wall

159
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,240
for heat so

160
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,600
in our borders little stand you can see

161
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,400
how fast it takes out the heat and

162
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,479
it's amazing so this is the future for

163
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,359
hemp is absolutely there

164
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:14,000
even

165
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,160
you know we are quite industrial now all

166
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,560
financed by ourselves by sensing seeds

167
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,360
mainly

168
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,160
so we need also more investment in that

169
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,000
sense that if we really draw on if we do

170
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,000
3 000 hectares now

171
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,800
uh then we need to get investments you

172
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,439
know

173
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,520
uh what else i want to say you want to

174
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,959
can i go on or on yeah

175
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,120
well the other thing is there's two

176
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,959
things important

177
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,120
uh the first thing is i hear that

178
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,439
there's a there's a

179
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,600
sort of meeting now between different

180
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,000
countries hall and germany portugal and

181
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,680
another few countries and they want to

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,519
change their cannabis

183
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,280
rules in europe

184
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,279
and that is probably important because

185
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,439
cannabis

186
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,560
is a social cultural possession

187
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,800
that means

188
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,598
cannabis is from everybody

189
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,598
like a tomato

190
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,360
and from that point of view

191
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,759
you have to see that legalization is

192
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,680
very important soon and the best way to

193
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,840
do that is like the thai style you know

194
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,759
they just like legalize everything you

195
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,879
want to grow you grow you want to sell

196
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,639
yourself

197
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,560
whenever you do you do it

198
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,000
so that's very important

199
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,800
we received was also a new thing was

200
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,360
um

201
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,160
i was worried about already a long time

202
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,360
that you know all the cbt you have the

203
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,280
extraction

204
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,038
co2 attraction

205
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,719
full

206
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:48,639
and then you have all kind of different

207
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,759
distractions and you got the isolate

208
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,160
well

209
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,199
there is a big research going on on the

210
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,560
moment about the toxicity of

211
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,598
cbd in germany the ayah

212
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,120
european

213
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:01,918
organization

214
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,598
uh

215
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:05,359
study for more than one and a half

216
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:08,079
million something like that

217
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,199
and the first results come out that cbd

218
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:14,639
is okay for people

219
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,478
isolate not sure so i'm i'm scared that

220
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,800
isolate

221
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:21,360
will be again something that the

222
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,000
anti-cannabis people gonna smash us with

223

279
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,399
with the pond

280
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,399

284
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,159

business about making money

295
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,399
it's not anymore and it has to be like

296
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:23,838

300
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:32,639
a big example we have three factories i

301
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,759

302
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:35,360
factory

303
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,519
and it was running and the insulation

304
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,200
came out and i cried

305
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,639

306
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,720
we got it

307
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,078
and we don't have enough customers

308
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,759
and it's all

309
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:50,399

regulations you're over every way

315

and we got one reaction from our people

337
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,319
from the politicians

338

344
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,560
know especially when i'm still

345
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,000
uh let me know

346
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,399
here and uh

347
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,200
god comes from a country which also has

348
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,919
a

349
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,639
very big cannabis legacy which has

350
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,559
cannabis as a part of its culture

351
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,519
different from europe

352
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:30,799
since a long time different from europe

353
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,839
in jamaica where government comes from

354
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,958
cannabis

355
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,720
is part of the society

356
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:40,879
ever since one time in germany in europe

357
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,600
that changed the hippie area

358
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,799
when

359
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,040
before cannabis was known but not was

360
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,759
not very widespread so my question to

361
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:51,039
jordan is in which way

362
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:52,639
you found it

363
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:56,000
you're in the cannabis industry in the

364
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:59,278
legal cannabis industry now but how did

365
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,240
the jamaican cannabis legacy influence

366
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,480
the

367
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,198
industry are the development of the

368
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,600
cannabis industry in jamaica with the

369
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,599
strains with the growing techniques in

370
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,720
general is there is there any influence

371
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,839
or did you just make your grow your own

372
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,839
grow up your own business

373
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,519
um well i think from our perspective you

374
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,800
know when i started chemix it was

375
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,078
because

376
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,919
i saw a huge reaction in the market um

377
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,759
that was based in fair

378
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,159
um a lot of the traditional farmers were

379
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,399
scared that you're gonna have you know

380
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:34,399
canadians and just people from overseas

381
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,198
come in and take over the market

382
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,480
and there would be no space for them in

383
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:39,519
the industry

384
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,120
and

385
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,440
you know it was a very

386
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,959
it was to me it was very very impactful

387
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,639
i mean i don't have a

388
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,799
you know it's funny you you're bringing

389
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,198
all the legacy catalyst

390
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,679
here and i don't really have a lot of it

391
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:54,399
outside of a real deep-seated desire to

392
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:59,838
see

393
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:01,679
the caribbean thrive and what i saw was

394
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,839
on the horizon this

395
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,239
that we could get left behind to make it

396
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,680
get left behind all jamaica represents

397
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,278
for this industry

398
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,239
um culturally

399
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:12,559
um

400
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,799
you know how it's inspired

401
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,799
so many people around the industry to

402
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:17,838
sort of embrace cannabis embrace the way

403
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,319
of life

404
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,560
it had the real possibility of being

405
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,760
left behind being excluded

406
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,838
and that was something that really

407
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,319
didn't sit right wrong with me at all

408
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,440
and so my reaction was what could we do

409
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,360
to

410
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,880
ensure that did not happen

411
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,800
and i think

412
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,958
the biggest the biggest

413
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,479
thing we did that helped in that is we

414
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,559
decided to bring

415
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,560
to our conference to host a conference

416
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,479
first of all the international community

417
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:47,039
could see was at a certain standard

418
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,759
right but to then bring

419
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:52,399
growers from legal markets to come and

420
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,240
talk to cultivators in jamaica to bring

421
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,559
doctors from legal markets to speak to

422
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,799
doctors in jamaica and scientists and

423
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,559
business people regulators etc etc

424
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:03,758
because you know everyone's speaking

425
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:06,638
their the same language at that point

426
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,959
and i think what has been lost over time

427
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,879
is the deep history of jamaica with

428
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,879
cannabis and i'm very happy to have seen

429
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,958
this evolve

430
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:16,879
you know we're all experts until we know

431
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,119
something we don't know so we learn what

432
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,838
we don't know we all know everything and

433
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,240
i think what we have seen

434
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:26,880
is cultivators when they've been able to

435
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,000
be exposed to cultivators from other

436
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,120
communities other markets that have the

437
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,039
same

438
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,440
relationship with the plant the same

439
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:37,679
care the same understanding of the

440
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,079
energy that it represents then they

441
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,239
build trust and they can let their guard

442
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,000
down to say well and we saw the cannabis

443
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,198
it was uh sorry cannons it was so

444
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,759
touching

445
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:49,439
i saw and it's a guy from amsterdam

446
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,039
actually um

447
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,440
i forget his name was captain hooter and

448
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:55,198
somebody else but they sat with you know

449
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,440
we let a lot of the traditional farmers

450
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,639
come in um without charge so they can be

451
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,560
part of it

452
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,959
and on the first day they sat and were

453
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,399
sort of assessing their bug

454
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,438
and it was like what are you talking

455
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,120
about what's wrong there's nothing wrong

456
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,919
with my body i've been doing this

457
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,558
and then

458
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,720
because i saw the expertise the care the

459
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:15,279
attention the knowledge

460
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,759
then the following day here were these

461
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,838
two guys from amsterdam sort of um

462
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,000
critiquing some of the grow the

463
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:24,798
following day there's probably about 15

464
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,720
farmers waiting to talk to them to hear

465
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:28,318
for them to assess their blood and say

466
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,679
is mine better look at this one and you

467
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:30,558
know and it was a wonderful thing

468
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,160
because

469
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,480
when you break down these walls that

470
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,880
we've artificially erected

471
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,480
then you have this this energy that can

472
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,240
flow and i think

473
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,720
you know i i hear you know obviously

474
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,038
your legacy is way online but if there's

475
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,720
one point of coming in clean in the last

476
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:48,240
sort of six seven eight years this

477
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,360
industry

478
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,038
i have seen is that

479
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,798
yes it's a business

480
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,798
but if you try to do this business

481
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:58,879
without the essence and the heart of

482
00:17:56,798 --> 00:17:59,759
what this plant represents

483
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,120
and i'm going to use some of the

484
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,038
colorful language you use because i like

485
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:06,159
to you're going to get

486
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:08,400
period because the plant knows what it's

487
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,400
doing and we have seen so many people

488
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,440
since we started mechanics running to

489
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,280
jamaica and yeah we're going to do this

490
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,880
and they promised the sun the movement

491
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,960
stars and the bamboozle people out of

492
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,400
their businesses and what have you and

493
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,480
none of those people today are thriving

494
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,559
in cannabis you know this plant has

495
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,960
taken them apart

496
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:29,119
spat them out and now you have to come

497
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,519
back to the reality that you can build a

498
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,359
pharma based business you can build a

499
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,720
therapeutic business you can build any

500
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:36,240
ancillary

501
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,480
business that touches this plan but if

502
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,000
you're doing it without an appreciation

503
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,000
and understanding

504
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,279
of how it can help people how it can

505
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,960
serve people

506
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:46,720
i don't care how smart we all are i

507
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,960
don't care how well we've been trained

508
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,460
you're gonna get eaten up and splat out

509
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:57,759
as it should

510
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:59,759
[Applause]

511
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:03,279
when when it comes to the european

512
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:05,279
cannabis industry you are part of it for

513
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:08,319
a long time

514
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:10,720
god just mentioned some fears

515
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:12,079
jamaican organic farmers and traditional

516
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,079
farmers have

517
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,240
and what do you think about the

518
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:17,918
development of the

519
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,798
cannabis of the

520
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:24,400
produce producing cannabis like cannabis

521
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:27,759
production in europe do you think the

522
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,320
people who should be in the position to

523
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,400
to produce cannabis are there or do you

524
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:35,200
think in general

525
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:39,038
we waste a lot of knowledge because it

526
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,720
cannot be used in public so far well i i

527
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:44,558
think

528
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,558
yeah it's a question like uh

529
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,799
do you still grow

530
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,600
tobacco in your garden you know you

531
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:51,200
don't

532
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:54,000
you buy it in the show

533
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,759
do you grow your own wine in your garden

534
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,798
you buy it in the shop

535
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,720
i

536
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:01,519
it will be that in the future it has to

537
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,519
be industrial so it

538
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:04,400
it's like you said it is for the people

539
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:06,879
so

540
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,200
but also one thing is for sure

541
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,880
quality conquers all and a lot of

542
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,319
companies like you mentioned

543
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,880
that

544
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,879
they can do any kind of things even the

545
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,240
biggest i hear i don't know names i

546
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,120
don't want to mention

547
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,519
but

548
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:24,079
the quality is not good so it's

549
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,679
it's like that

550
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:26,720
so it's always

551
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,400
about

552
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,240
the quality and

553
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,120
you know it's it's always difficult

554
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,319
because i never met anybody who didn't

555
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:37,839
say oh my god my grass is the best

556
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,960
it's always the best when you grow with

557
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:39,678
your own

558
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,600
so

559
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,720
grow your own the only thing what i see

560
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,038
is that

561
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,400
genetically you know there's so much

562
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:47,200
hybrids

563
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,400
and

564
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,080
i met a guy who was quite known

565
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,038
uh in the field and he said well in

566
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:54,558
america

567
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:57,359
it's 80 percent

568
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:59,918
your genes since you see genes in it so

569
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:02,959
it spreads out and that's good it's okay

570
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:05,600
and that's the best thing you can happen

571
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,319
but in the meantime there's a big

572
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,558
uh demand now bigger demand on the right

573
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:13,519
uh regardless so everybody wants

574
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:16,000
feminize everyone want these but regular

575
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:18,480
seats also you know that is still the

576
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,279
beautiful races a long time ago so

577
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,279
that's interesting

578
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:27,839
um when we talk about regular races when

579
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,640
we talk about selection of strengths uh

580
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:30,399
god

581
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,280
i want to know from you

582
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,360
um

583
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:37,038
i've been in jamaica

584
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:39,519
31 years ago and i know there were a lot

585
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:40,720
of collectors of strains already at that

586
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,879
time

587
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,798
strains were a topic in jamaica before

588
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,679
they were topic in germany i know in

589
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:49,839
netherlands they were also a topic but

590
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,559
is there a chance or was there a chance

591
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:56,079
to bring the jamaican genetics to the

592
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:58,798
industry or do they still grow import

593
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,000
genetics i no i have no idea about that

594
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,639
yeah

595
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,720
that makes two of us no uh

596
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,400
i think what what i've seen in jamaica

597
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,480
and what i hear in jamaica and you know

598
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,840
you know actually is very disturbing

599
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,919
i remember being at a conference in

600
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:16,079
vegas and a canadian girl actually told

601
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,840
me that they don't need to grow jamaican

602
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,199
genetics and bring them out of jamaica

603
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:20,798
anymore they're going to do it in a

604
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,480
greenhouse in canada

605
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,798
put the jamaican stamp on it and that's

606
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,200
the end of that and it was that attitude

607
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:29,599
that i just felt was so

608
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,600
it's it's just completely out of sync

609
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,279
with what this industry represents and i

610
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,359
think you know there's a lot of there's

611
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:37,119
a lot of work being done in terms of ip

612
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:40,000
in jamaica and how you protect the seeds

613
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:41,759
and genetics um where that sits today

614
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
it's still being still being developed

615
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:46,000
and evolved i think unfortunately for

616
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,798
jamaica we have not seen

617
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,720
yet

618
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,558
the kind of

619
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,240
progress in the industry that i would

620
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:54,639
like to see i think the industry is not

621
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,120
working as closely together as it should

622
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,080
to to affect the positive impacts that

623
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:59,599
it has

624
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,639
um you know why i like to go to all

625
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:03,038
these different international

626
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,320
conferences is it's a very sharp

627
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:05,679
reminder

628
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:08,240
of

629
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,679
the potential of the jamaican industry

630
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,359
again i go back to sort of the

631
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,759
references in the culture we talk about

632
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:16,399
brands all the time but what is a brand

633
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:18,640
brand is a construct of values that it

634
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,360
represents to a consumer

635
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,200
and

636
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:24,798
the jamaican brand quote unquote is that

637
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,400
because i have some friends

638
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:28,079
in this industry as they like to tell me

639
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,280
they were in this industry long before

640
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,879
it was legal

641
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:32,319
and they're shipped all over the world

642
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,080
and they tell me that they can tell

643
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:35,678
folks how to organize the banking they

644
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,119
can figure out everything

645
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,798
but you know

646
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,639
again we get so complicated and

647
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:41,918
sophisticated today

648
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,520
and this is what this is what one of my

649
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,960
friends said he said

650
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,200
let me tell you something see all this

651
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,679
strange strange train talk

652
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,400
back in the day we used to take all the

653
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,480
jamaican mead compress it together put

654
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,240
in a brick ship it off to new york and

655
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,319
you know the people would say

656
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,839
damn

657
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:02,158
because it's jamaica

658
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:03,678
and there's a this is a real in in terms

659
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,600
of the consumer and i saw this when i

660
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,400
was first starting this event

661
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:08,079
off

662
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,200
i went to la

663
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,519
and i told him i was going to do this

664
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,720
event in jamaica you know a ganja event

665
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,918
in jamaica the first person says to me

666
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,839
that's a idea like where are you

667
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,960
going to get the good weed from and i

668
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:21,599
was like what are you talking about i

669
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,679
start to get defensive but this man

670
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,079
had been to jamaica in the past three

671
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,000
years over a hundred times he'd been to

672
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,678
all the different cultivators all the

673
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,359
fields he knew exactly what he was

674
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,600
talking about

675
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:36,158
later the same day i go to a friend of

676
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,759
mine who's a music producer and he says

677
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,520
um tell him the same thing and he said

678
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,440
that's a brilliant idea

679
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,558
because the weed in jamaica is the best

680
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,798
in the world

681
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:46,798
now i'm hearing this both sides of the

682
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,960
he says to me they brought the game down

683
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,880
to record music

684
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,880
and from his first day he's like forget

685
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,320
the music we're smoking weed the whole

686
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,200
time we're here

687
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:59,359
and

688
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,440
why am i making this point because

689
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,439
on the seed side of it on the genetic

690
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,320
side of it there's a market just like

691
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,240
fine wine there's a connoisseur who

692
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:10,000
knows that product and who's going to be

693
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,000
able to sip that line and say this is

694
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,880
good and this is not good

695
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,440
but 95 percent of the consumer

696
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,799
it's it's a different experience

697
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,960
it's a different experience when you

698
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:22,558
land in havana and someone hands you a

699
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,759
hand rolled cigar

700
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:25,038
you're like this is

701
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:26,798
a cigar

702
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:29,038
when you're buying a quality cigar from

703
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,119
your little cigar shop in idaho you're

704
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:34,879
like yeah i bought a cigar and we have

705
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:36,879
to be very aware of what the whole brand

706
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,640
um experience is

707
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,799
not not to move it away from you know

708
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,720
the sort of historical nature of it but

709
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,960
those are the things that i look at with

710
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,000
the with a pure vision i learn a lot

711
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,600
from

712
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,919
folks who did it for as long as you have

713
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:52,319
and it's such a deep and rich history

714
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,400
that we must not let go of but i think

715
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:57,278
in this next iteration from my

716
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,960
perspective with this this industry is

717
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:00,480
understanding

718
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,440
what those things

719
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,200
potentially mean for today's consumer

720
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,798
you know i hear and i was guilty of this

721
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,640
in the beginning

722
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:11,119
we talk a lot about you know academics

723
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,759
being a commodity but yet the

724
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:16,079
interesting thing about cannabis is

725
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:18,158
cannabis can be commoditized but it's

726
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:20,000
also a finished product raw flour is a

727
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,880
finished product there's a consumer for

728
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,278
whom that is the finished product and we

729
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,400
as an industry have to represent and and

730
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:29,038
protect

731
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:32,480
these different ways of consuming

732
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:34,720
the cannabis because ultimately and you

733
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,240
get to where you talked about

734
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,600
you know it's grown

735
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,440
in your backyard and look at what we've

736
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:42,959
seen with alcohol and beer

737
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,759
we've gone from mass production to now

738
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,159
a real a real value for craft that's

739
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:49,200
exactly i i mean and

740
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,799
but you

741
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,798
talk about

742
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:55,200
quantity different different

743
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:57,599
and i said well i never met anybody who

744
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,679
would grow him his own he got the best

745
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:02,480
that's not with countries even jamaica

746
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:05,038
has bloody good grass

747
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,640
census seas have about around 1 000

748
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:08,480
different varieties

749
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,278
and about uh

750
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:15,038
400 we keep constantly alive so we still

751
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:15,919
have the same plants like 35 years ago

752
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:17,359
that is

753
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,360
important because

754
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,038
it's it's like wine you know you can

755
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:23,759
drink a glass of butter while you say i

756
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:25,038
like that you like that like that

757
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,440
and even with

758
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,359
everybody here we can smoke different

759
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,759
grass and everybody will pick his own

760
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:33,759
you know it is nice for me and medically

761
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:36,319
it's gonna be also like that so it's

762
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:39,038
always nice to try different

763
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:41,278
varieties i think and and then you find

764
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:43,919
the one you like the most you know and

765
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,359
that is but it's important still also

766
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,440
for the consumers

767
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,719
to have those choices i see now i hear

768
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,038
in america

769
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,079
you have two choices about 100 different

770
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:53,839
strains

771
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:55,359
so that's going to be difficult you know

772
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,119
to choose you

773
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:58,879
and the funny thing is

774
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:02,319
today you pick these and then three

775
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,840
months later they have a new name on it

776
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:05,918
and then so like shakespeare said

777
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:08,158
already what's in the name you know

778
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,640
and yeah quality is

779
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,000
number one and then and then you have

780
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,399
real something

781
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,640
that you can keep constantly the same

782
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:19,278
and it's important and that is what the

783
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,520
medical marijuana from holland is from

784
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:24,558
jack's heritage stream

785
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:27,359
it is super good it's superb

786
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:29,038
so i'm happy for the for the patients

787
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,798
they smoke that stuff

788
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:32,240
and of course they can't go to a coffee

789
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,079
shop and buy something else and maybe

790
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,000
they like it more it's also

791
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,960
so is everybody

792
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,960
different in a way

793
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:47,759
when you were collected seats in the

794
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:50,639
1980s

795
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:53,359
i remember i don't remember but i know

796
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,399
that you were actually the only person

797
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:57,359
who brought in indica genetics into

798
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,000
europe

799
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:03,759
there were only people bringing in haste

800
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,960
dramatics like the sacred seat grew like

801
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,759
shirt makers they were all bringing in

802
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,440
so

803
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,759
actually

804
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,759
i don't know if

805
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,720
the audience or in the industry the

806
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,919
cannabis industry knows

807
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,960
two or three

808
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:24,240
strains of your company are the basis

809
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,640
for any hybrid and for any any indica

810
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,960
indica cannabis which is now sold as

811
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,080
medical is that right that's it's

812
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,960
correct

813
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:34,480
um of course it's not us to do that but

814
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,798
it's true

815
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,798
well that is fun you know we were also

816
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:40,798
in holland the first would be the

817
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:43,119
cloning nobody hear about cloning

818
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:45,038
everybody always with seeds so that was

819
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:46,879
also a new development that right away

820
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:49,278
you know we could put a greenhouse full

821
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,520
of the same plants like wow

822
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:53,759
and before that you had all kind of

823
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,918
different plants so it was

824
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:57,679
but you know it's it's also true that of

825
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,320
course the new technologies now in the

826
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,960
laboratories are going on

827
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:04,079
they are far you know we are classical

828
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,240
breeders

829
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:08,798
right the old style and

830
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,960
my son ellen is already a step ahead

831
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:12,639
he's all i mean and now my other son

832
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,720
ravi they're working already in the lab

833
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,200
with all kind of stuff so it's going

834
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,919
really to scientific matter and it has

835
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,600
to be like it has to be industrial it

836
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,840
has to be business

837
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:25,519
like anything it's not anymore

838
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:28,639
under the table marijuana should be

839
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,839
legal open for everybody as a social

840
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,919
cultural

841
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:33,918
possession and

842
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,320
people should make money on it

843
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:39,200
in all kinds of ways with all everybody

844
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:41,678
you try to do and we all try our best

845
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,360
and so what we can do but we have to do

846
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,880
it for the people i think

847
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:46,719
you too

848
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,760
when i was

849
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,038
when i was a

850
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,440
young guy

851
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:54,000
and i was 18 years old i went to my

852
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,798
first coffee shops in netherlands it was

853
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,839
a very very nice experience for me

854
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:02,720
and i was kind of expecting

855
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:06,639
that netherlands is kind of legalized

856
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,240
someday in the near future

857
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,200
and

858
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,240
then

859
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,440
the whole situation changed in the 90s

860
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,359
it became

861
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,759
i thought it became clear the

862
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:20,959
netherlands will not legalize very soon

863
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:23,359
and

864
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,679
in the first decade of the 2000 i

865
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:27,359
thought okay netherlands will also not

866
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,919
be the first country in the world to

867
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:33,038
legalize cannabis because there were

868
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,360
other players on the scene which

869
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:36,960
were faster than the netherlands

870
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,759
so

871
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,759
you developed your business everything

872
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:45,200
in amsterdam at the center of the

873
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:47,359
european cannabis culture for decades

874
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,720
how do you see the future of the dutch

875
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:51,359
cannabis

876
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:55,440
culture and industry is it

877
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:57,839
like going down is it dying or can it

878
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,240
like come back again

879
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:02,558
i just wanted i hope that all that does

880
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,720
become stoned like me you know

881
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:05,759
because all the dots kind of smoke you

882
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,000
know

883
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:11,679
what the you know what to do um

884
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,839
you can't look in the future in that

885
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,000
sense because the politicians are

886
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:17,918
totally spaghetti you know they go this

887
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,759
way that way you know and they find

888
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,519
always something and so

889
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:24,079
it is hard to say that they make an

890
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,200
experiment now that density is going to

891
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:27,038
have

892
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,759
or something tenses you can have an

893
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:32,398
experiment that they don't buy in the

894
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:34,319
back door illegal anymore but now

895
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:35,918
they're gonna have producers and they

896
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,599
buy it legal

897
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,440
and then i'm wearing it you know because

898
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:42,079
i like the smoke hatch also if the

899
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,919
coffee shops only can just sell drugs i

900
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:46,079
wouldn't like you the other thing i

901
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,240
would like i can say

902
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:51,759
open the world and we can have the good

903
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:54,720
hands that i smoke in afghanistan

904
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:57,278
in my museum i tell the story that

905
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,360
the in afghanistan again he got about

906
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:02,398
two or three hundred maybe maybe

907
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:04,079
something like that at dollars a kilo

908
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:07,599
and the coffee shop financial amsterdam

909
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:08,960
it ends up into the consumer for 16 000

910
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:09,759
so couldn't we

911
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,159
buy

912
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:15,200
good afghan ash there for a couple of

913
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,720
thousands the afghans make schools farms

914
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,200
and

915
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:23,000
hospitals and we can smoke with them

916
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,000
wouldn't that be nice

917
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:30,240
and we also did not talk about uh the

918
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:34,000
american

919
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,278
hush yet because this is also a kind of

920
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,798
the market

921
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:41,839
supplying europe ever since which

922
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:44,240
until the early 2000s it was had 90

923
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:45,759
percent of the market now it went down a

924
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,038
little bit but still

925
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:49,359
it has all

926
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:52,480
big part of the of the german cannabis

927
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:55,119
market is covered by hashish for morocco

928
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,839
and as we all know morocco is

929
00:33:55,119 --> 00:34:00,158
changing policies right now and i think

930
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:01,519
this would also be a very very good

931
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,880
chance

932
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,720
to bring morocco into the boat so not so

933
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,519
many people have to

934
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:13,039
die in boats you know because america's

935
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:15,599
industry is dying and a lot of people

936
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:18,159
are dying every day trying to enter

937
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,240
europe through morocco and i think the

938
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,240
working cannabis industry in north

939
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:24,319
northern africa it's not only about

940
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:28,559
morocco a work in canada with industry

941
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:31,440
northern africa would be a very uh a

942
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:33,119
very good reason not to try to come to

943
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,918
europe you know if we have a world

944
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,919
market and drawn in in the mediterranean

945
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:41,759
sea

946
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,759
this is a very sad situation

947
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,760
the same thing bombing now

948
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:49,118
ukraine

949
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,119
but the bombing yemen they born in

950
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,760
palestine

951
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,358
a part of syria still occupied and

952
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,960
drinking all

953
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:57,920
the streaming

954
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,199
a lot of

955
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,599
people died

956
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:03,439
and i was saying a long time ago and

957
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,200
talked my friend here

958
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,280
he said

959
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,319
let's bomb seeds in the world instead of

960
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,160
bombs

961
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,200
let's grow marijuana all over the world

962
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:14,000
let's

963
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:16,399
let's take this out all these bad

964
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,519
things that happen what how can we stop

965
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,000

973
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,199
