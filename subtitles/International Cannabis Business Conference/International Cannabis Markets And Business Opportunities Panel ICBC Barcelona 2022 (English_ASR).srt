lawyer maybe we'll have

101
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:07,840
let's say a weird kind of view

102
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,959
on the market

103
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,158
okay great thank you thank you guys

104
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,640
so

105
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,959
let's start with the with the panel

106
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:20,238
let's talk first of all about licensing

107
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,879
process and legal framework

108
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,959
can you please chloe let us know how is

109
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,839
the situation in us or in the united

110
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,638
states

111
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:31,599
absolutely and the situation in the

112
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,519
united states is pretty unique so the

113
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,320
first thing to note is that at the

114
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,918
federal level cannabis is actually

115
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,519
not legal

116
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,599
it's considered a schedule one

117
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:44,719
controlled substance meaning it doesn't

118
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,479
have any recognized medicinal

119
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:51,199
use and also is considered to have high

120
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:54,399
potential for abuse

121
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:58,080
so but the the way that american law is

122
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,198
set up the division of state and federal

123
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,240
authority

124
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,720
gives states a lot of power over

125
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,478
writing their own laws within their own

126
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,360
boundaries so that has allowed states to

127
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,639
experiment with cannabis policy within

128
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,800
their um

129
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,800
within their borders so

130
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,360
they effectively decide whether to

131
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,839
regulate cannabis as well as how to

132
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,639
regulate cannabis and this has led to a

133
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,719
patchwork of state regulations so every

134
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,360
state is very different which i think is

135
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,240
important to understand

136
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,520
so the licensing structures and the

137
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,519
markets

138
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,319
the way that the markets are structured

139
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,478
are very intertwined in the us and i

140
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:46,000
think probably everywhere

141
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:48,240
and the dynamics between those two shape

142
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,959
the business opportunities as well as

143
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,879
the strategies that businesses use to

144
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,478
succeed in this market so we'll talk a

145
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,680
little bit about that

146
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,439
later

147
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,879
so

148
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:04,000
in terms of the ways that states differ

149
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:06,240
in structure and licensing process

150
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,959
there are some more restrictive states

151
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,240
which tend to have limited license

152
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,560
systems

153
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,639
um and those systems typically have

154
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,280
higher barriers to entry

155
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,639
um and are attractive for reasons that i

156
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:23,758
think we can all understand

157
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,759
many unlimited license states see

158
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,199
explosive growth and one of the things

159
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,720
that's really interesting about those

160
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,680
states is

161
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,039
you really see the innovation and the

162
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,800
excitement of a true capitalist

163
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:40,959
environment that's hyper competitive

164
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,120
there's also licensing both at the state

165
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,918
and local level sometimes both at the

166
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,918
same time in one market

167
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:51,120
so some states typically more

168
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:53,038
conservative ones choose not to give the

169
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,598
localities any control

170
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,918
whereas others like california actually

171
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:59,439
give a lot of control to the localities

172
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,719
and that creates a whole different

173
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,598
situation

174
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,160
so when the localities do have control

175
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,839
you tend to have longer licensing

176
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,080
processes

177
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,560
you can have higher costs and just

178
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,800
frankly more headaches

179
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,800
so that is something to watch out for if

180
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,038
you're looking at cannabis markets in

181
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,400
the united states

182
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:23,839
there are also four different licensing

183
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,478
processes

184
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,000
that i would categorize them into

185
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,359
so the first is

186
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
limited

187
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,720
or competitive licensing so

188
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,839
this is typical of limited licensed

189
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,599
markets

190
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:41,598
so again high barriers to entry

191
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:45,680
and it's kind of like a professional

192
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:48,639
battle royale for these coveted licenses

193
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,879
the second type is a lottery licensing

194
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,598
model so in that case

195
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,000
all companies that meet a set of minimum

196
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:59,038
standards are have their name thrown

197
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,038
into the hat so to speak and

198
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:04,478
are randomly selected to get licenses

199
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,639
so the purpose of that model is

200
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:09,839
basically to try to

201
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,560
even the playing field and also

202
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,239
cut down on bias in the license award

203
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,639
process

204
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,439
another different model is

205
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,280
just a straight minimum standards model

206
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:24,399
and this is very typical of unlimited

207
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:26,638
license markets so anybody who meets the

208
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,918
minimum standards is able to get a

209
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,000
license

210
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:33,439
and then finally this is a little bit

211
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
different but there's grandfathering of

212
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,039
existing operators so let's say a market

213
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,918
is going from medical to adult use

214
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,958
so

215
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:45,759
at that catalyst point the medical

216
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:48,399
operators are typically grandfathered in

217
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,559
or have some process for converting into

218
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,080
the new market so they kind of get first

219
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,958
right of entry

220
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,278
so

221
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,278
yeah i think those are the key points

222
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,200
and i will pass it back to you

223
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:00,559
okay thank you chloe just to add one

224
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,480
line more

225
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:05,359
when do you think we will

226
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,360
see a federal regulation

227
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:12,000
that is the billion dollar question

228
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,278
really it's hard to say we are seeing

229
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,120
support on

230
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,679
both sides of the aisle

231
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,159
at the federal level now i don't think

232
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:22,799
it will be you know within the next year

233
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,278
but we've been saying you know within

234
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,159
the next two years for quite a while now

235
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,320
so

236
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,399
it's anyone's guess but we are

237
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,680
definitely pushing behind the scenes for

238
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,600
that

239
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:37,838
thank you so much

240
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,879
so kai how is the situation in in german

241
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,200
a lot of people is excited about the

242
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,320
the latest news so please let us let us

243
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,519
know

244
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,320
sure

245
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,480
yes so germany had a federal election

246
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,360
last year in september

247
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,360
and

248
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,639
the parties especially the green party

249
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,000
and the liberals

250
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,480
they

251
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,639
declared or they said they want

252
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,600
legalization of cannabis

253
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:03,360
and the

254
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,920
social democratic party they were in

255
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,278
favor of model projects before that

256
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:09,759
beforehand

257
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:12,799
but it turned out in the coalition

258
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:15,759
negotiations that they really agreed on

259
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,838
a free market model on a legalization

260
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:18,480
with

261
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,680
dispensaries

262
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,039
and

263
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,838
that's yeah short passage in the in the

264
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,919
in the

265
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,720
coalition agreement

266
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,439
and

267
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,800
but

268
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,560
they say it's coming so

269
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,519
we have no problems

270
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:34,239
because

271
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,519
the

272
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,519
draft of the law will be dealt

273
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,360
the ministry of health is responsible is

274
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,039
in charge for this draft

275
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,759
and the ministry of health is also

276
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:48,319
responsible for corona and he is also

277
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:51,439
responsible for the health crisis coming

278
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,600
by the ukraine crisis so we have lots of

279
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,600
refugees we're expecting 10 million

280
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,800
refugees in europe

281
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,639
and

282
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,799
many people will come to germany as well

283
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,720
again and they have to integrate these

284
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:05,120
people into the health system so the

285
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,680
ministry of health is very very busy

286
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,480
and he is in charge of the draft because

287
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,000
it's

288
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,480
it's a health issue

289
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,480
we see that it's a harm reduction health

290
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,079
issue so the ministry of health is

291
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,959
supposed to deal with it

292
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:17,759
um

293
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,399
and

294
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:23,600
he said already carl alter there won't

295
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,600
be a draft this year so he will start

296
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,000
working with his ministry with this

297
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,920
house he will start working on the draft

298
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,720
uh early next year

299
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,240
so the debate is sort of in the off this

300
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,519
year

301
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,919
on on the legal nation side

302
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,159
and there are still some really problems

303
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,319
there's some some crucial problems we

304
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,679
have to solve especially the licensing

305
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,760
question

306
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,679
so there is a draft in place by the

307
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,039
green party the so-called cannabis

308
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,239
control act

309
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:56,078
they brought that to bundestag in 2017

310
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,200
the first time and last year the second

311
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:58,719
time

312
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,480
and this

313
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,639
draft for these

314
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,159
caps and minimum distances between

315
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,919
schools and

316
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,319
youth facilities

317
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:11,599
the minimum distances are no problem

318
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,879
but the caps the restrictions on maximum

319
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,680
numbers

320
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,919
for

321
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,799
dispensaries in a community that is a

322
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,919
real problem because when you issue a

323
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,039
license

324
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,120
and the authority uses or

325
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,399
exercises its discretion

326
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,679
how to pick

327
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,440
who to pick

328
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,479
and if you have

329
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,639
let's say

330
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,480
20 20

331
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,360
licenses you can give away in one

332
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,680
community but you have 200 interested

333
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,879
parties okay so the authority has to

334
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,078
make a decision

335
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:45,039
to pick

336
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:48,638
and if they didn't use their discretion

337
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:50,480
properly and your competitor says oh no

338
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,799
the authority make made to made a

339
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,560
mistake so they start a lawsuit a

340
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,399
competitor lawsuit

341
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,000
and then you may get your license and

342
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,639
start working and start selling and

343
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,958
start investing and after two years

344
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,519
the court says no you i will withdraw

345
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:08,638
your license because your competitor

346
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:12,480
won so that's going to be a big problem

347
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,959
and we will do all we can this year uh

348
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,159
to convince the lawmakers that there are

349
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:19,199
no need for four caps for from

350
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,519
maximum

351
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,680
number of restrictions

352
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,519
because there is no need they always say

353
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,278
we need restrictions on the on the

354
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,110
numbers

355
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:31,360
the the

356
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:33,200
[Music]

357
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,440
the scientists the

358
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,759
drug scientists and social

359
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,839
social

360
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,919
social workers are saying that but it

361
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,040
doesn't make it make sense so then you

362
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:47,919
have an unrestricted number of licenses

363
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:50,480
the advantage is you can start from day

364
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,799
one with enough dispensaries uh the you

365
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,039
can fight the illicit market really

366
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,639
effectively but there will of course be

367
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,799
a market checkout after two or three

368
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,959
years because of the oversupply but

369
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,919
that's what i think is is the better

370
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,439
option for for for germany to to choose

371
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:08,799
yeah and we will see how that will

372
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,800
unfold this year the debate um

373
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:14,159
everyone's saying it's coming from the

374
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:16,240
government but please be patient

375
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,240
we also demanded a

376
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,519
decriminalization in the in the first

377
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,480
step

378
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:25,039
but the coalition said no we want one

379
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,519
law we want one draft we want one

380
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:30,240
solution and not decriminalization

381
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,480
beforehand and then legalization because

382
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,799
that endangers the whole project

383
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,000
that's what they say but still courts

384
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,159
are still

385
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,320
judging they still law enforcement is

386
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,240
still working on cannabis cases are

387
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,240
still chasing after

388
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,639
consumers right now after cbd businesses

389
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,278
so we still have to do some advocating

390
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,759
this year and some lobbying this year

391
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:56,720
but i'm convinced it's it's coming

392
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:59,519
they're all saying all the

393
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,320
members who have the power in in the

394
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,320
coalition uh say that it's coming so

395
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,480
let's let's see

396
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,440
i know it's not gonna be

397
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,440
easy it's not gonna be fast but i really

398
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,680
hope that germany royally is cannabis

399
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,760
because that would be an amazing example

400
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,359
for the rest of uh countries in in

401
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,439
europe so

402
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,919
let us know juana how is

403
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,560
everything going in switzerland

404
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:28,639
very well you know swiss southern is

405
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:31,359
called european hub of cannabis

406
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,919
as you know and so the socio-relation of

407
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,800
cannabis differentiates between the

408
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:40,078
three different uses the industrial the

409
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:42,159
medical and the recreational use and

410
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,879
therefore three different

411
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:48,159
regulations i'm going to speak about and

412
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:49,519
at least i will speak about the latest

413
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,838
developments

414
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:56,480
and you have to know it's all about the

415
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:58,720
thc concentration and irrespective of

416
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,680
the cbd content

417
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,278
unlike

418
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:06,559
thc cbd in switzerland is not considered

419
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:08,480
as a narcotic so firstly let's have a

420
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,958
look on the

421
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,879
industrial use the swiss loss regarding

422
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:16,239
the industrial use

423
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:18,958
is very liberal as you know already so

424
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,519
the industrial cannabis that is less

425
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:24,719
than one percent i will speak always

426
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:28,078
about this limit one percent is not

427
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,278
legally a narcotic but is subject to the

428
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,239
regulation

429
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,039
how how it comes to the markets so if

430
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,039
it's

431
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:39,439
food cosmetics tobacco what else

432
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,958
chemicals and so on so the uses

433
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,639
permitted

434
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,638
permitted

435
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,919
are determined by these regulations food

436
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,320
cosmetics

437
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,399
liquids for tobaccos and so on if you

438
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,399
want some i can give later on the

439
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,958
questions

440
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:58,000
in the discussion detailed information

441
00:16:54,958 --> 00:17:01,679
so the status for the industrial use

442
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,640
it is legal in switzerland as long as it

443
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,359
contains less than one percent

444
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,038
than

445
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,000
of thc

446
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:12,558
let's have a look on the medical use

447
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,318
the swiss law regarding the medicinal

448
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:15,918
cannabis is

449
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:19,918
let's say

450
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:23,759
surprisingly limited in comparison to

451
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:26,480
the industrial use so growing selling

452
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,000
important cannabis for medical uses or

453
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,919
medical purpose

454
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,400
is allowed however

455
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,400
there's a distinction between calibers

456
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,160
containing at least one

457
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,080
percent thc

458
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,279
and other cannabis

459
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:44,879
so we have to differentiate between the

460
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:48,960
cannabis at least one percent thc

461
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,480
and less than one percent tc

462
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,679
first of all cannabis containing at

463
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,880
least one percent dc is qualified as a

464
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,600
narcotic

465
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,960
but

466
00:17:55,599 --> 00:18:01,119
it can be qualified as a medical product

467
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,319
it could be very interesting

468
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:05,359
for some of you

469
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:07,918
in this case the specific specific

470
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:11,439
medicinal product relation applies that

471
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:14,480
means the cannabis can only be grown

472
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,840
imported and sold for medical use if

473
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,200
permitted

474
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:21,439
permitted by the federal office

475
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,000
for the public

476
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,200
health it's permitted but you need a

477
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,599
permission

478
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,759
and the cannabis containing less than

479
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:32,079
one percent intended to be used for

480
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:36,000
medical purposes is subject to the

481
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:39,759
general just the normal let's say normal

482
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,279
regulation medicine products and by that

483
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:44,879
you can manufacture who say a marketing

484
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,359
and market

485
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,360
cannabis

486
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,720
now or in this days the patients have

487
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:56,558
access to authorized cannabis based

488
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,000
drugs only on medical prescription but

489
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:00,319
they have

490
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,400
access for cannabis containing at least

491
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:05,279
one percent thc

492
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,798
patients can apply via their positions

493
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,160
that permission

494
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,639
and

495
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,759
so we can have

496
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,520
uh

497
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,319
say or we can say

498
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,440
it's legal cannabis in switzerland is

499
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:21,359
legal

500
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,200
even though it contains more or at least

501
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:27,119
one percent thc

502
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:31,038
but you need an official permit and a

503
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:32,000
medical prescription but it's allowed

504
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:34,960
and

505
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,200
thirdly the recreational use maybe some

506
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,079
of you will be interested in that

507
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,679
so the at the adult recreational

508
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:45,199
cannabis use has been decriminalized in

509
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,720
switzerland

510
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,600
so cannabis

511
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,440
containing at least one percent

512
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:53,279
at least one percentage

513
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,360
in comparison to other european

514
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:59,359
countries a lot is qualified

515
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,319
as a narcotic

516
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,519
but

517
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:04,158
production

518
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:06,879
importation selling of cannabis

519
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:09,520
use is not allowed

520
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,440
but what's interesting the percep the

521
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,279
personal procession

522
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,320
of cannabis

523
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:21,200
with at least one percent

524
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:24,158
of fewer than 10 grams 10 grams is not

525
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,080
even subject to a fine

526
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,360
it's not allowed

527
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:29,839
but you

528
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,918
can have

529
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:32,959
at least or not

530
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,640
you can have

531
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,840
up to 10 grams

532
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,919
and you will not be fined

533
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:41,439
it's a very

534
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,880
swiss approach

535
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,600
so the status regarding the

536
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:50,559
recognition the use is it's illegal

537
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,558
if it contains at least one percent less

538
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:55,119
it's allowed but at least 10 percent

539
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:56,798
it's illegal but even though

540
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,158
um

541
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:01,200
you will

542
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,360
approach very low fines

543
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,360
um what would be very interesting is

544
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,199
speak about the latest developments

545
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:10,079
there are two

546
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,558
movements regarding firstly the

547
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:15,439
recreational use and

548
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:20,000
secondly the medical use

549
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:23,038
regarding recognition use in may 2021

550
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,640
the swiss government started a limited

551
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:28,000
10 years pilot program a pilot project

552
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,200
to study

553
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,200
the economic and the health impacts of

554
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:38,480
non-cannabis uses you remember the

555
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:42,798
medical use is allowed but now we have

556
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,480
the pilot project to have a look on

557
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:47,279
what happens with the non-medical

558
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,000
cannabis so again the swiss federal

559
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:53,038
office of public health issues

560
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,839
production permits to cannabis growers

561
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:58,519
to supply the program

562
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:03,678
and a

563
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:05,918
variety of thc and cbd thc and cbd

564
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,280
products will be

565
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,280
available to

566
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:11,519
the pilot participants

567
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:13,038
maybe somebody of you want to be a

568
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:15,279
volunteer

569
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:18,079
with this program because the

570
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:20,639
recreational cannabis pilot schemes are

571
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:22,079
requested by public or private

572
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,559
organizations

573
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,240
and they have to work together with

574
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:28,158
research

575
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,000
institutes

576
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,919
and i had a look on

577
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,079
the conditions

578
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,960
when you get or

579
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:39,759
how it's possible to get such a permit

580
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,480
what do you have to fulfill

581
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,919
the

582
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,519
programs they must have a specific

583
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,120
research goal

584
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:54,079
for example such as acquiring data so

585
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:56,399
acquiring data it's a very wide

586
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:57,599
ideas so what somebody of you would be

587
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,320
interested in

588
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:03,599
for example data on the social economic

589
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:05,519
effects on the cannabis legislation

590
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:06,240
and

591
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,279
the

592
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,599
pilot programs have to be limited that's

593
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:14,639
a problem maybe to a specific

594
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:18,879
municipality it may run for five years

595
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:21,038
but there's the opportunity to extend

596
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,919
and

597
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:27,519
what i thought it's very interesting

598
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,520
and the participants

599
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:33,119
are limited to

600
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:35,759
10 milligram thc per month

601
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,879
and the products cannot

602
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:38,400
in delay

603
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,480
in the law they say

604
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,679
they cannot

605
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,880
contain more than 20 percent

606
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,840
20 percent i think it's a lot and there

607
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,159
um

608
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:52,959
yeah some opportunities

609
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,600
for the market so produce producers are

610
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,360
held to strict quality standards

611
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:01,599
and they have to follow field tries that

612
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,479
conducted in 2020

613
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,199
and

614
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,200
they are allowed as i said before

615
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,080
volunteers participants

616
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,038
um

617
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:13,599
up to five thousand

618
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:16,558
five thousand so maybe some of you will

619
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:19,839
be joined or wanted to join

620
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:22,000
well um and there's another

621
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:23,839
late development regardless of medical

622
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,839
use as i said before

623
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,599
um switzerland

624
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:30,839
or the swiss government

625
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:35,199
plans to facilitate the access to

626
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:37,038
cannabis used treatments cannabis used

627
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,960
or based medicine

628
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:40,240
products for patients

629
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,278
and

630
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,079
in june 2020 two years ago

631
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:48,880
the federal council issued the draft

632
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:51,678
legislation and it has to

633
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:55,039
come enforce this summer so it's

634
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,480
very close that we will be offered with

635
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:59,440
new opportunities

636
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:02,319
and under the amended law

637
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,440
patients will be able to obtain cannabis

638
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:07,839
based treatments directly from doctors

639
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,720
they will no longer be

640
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:13,759
necessary to require an exceptional

641
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,919
permit by the authority

642
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:19,440
i can explain about

643
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,799
the medical youth program later

644
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,320
[Music]

645
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:24,720
just

646
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:26,158
in the end about the license

647
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,759
see

648
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,640
as i said before there's a national

649
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:35,119
program that opens opportunities for

650
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,640
growers producers and so on and

651
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:37,439
just the last year

652
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,038
the

653
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,240
federal office

654
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:44,640
already issued some licenses some it's

655
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,359
the so-called cannabis licensees but the

656
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:51,200
regulations environments

657
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:53,839
of the procedure are extremely high

658
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:58,000
but we could help to go through

659
00:25:53,839 --> 00:26:00,319
among other things a safety concert a

660
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,599
safety concept and the quality

661
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,480
management

662
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:07,918
must be demonstrated

663
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:11,278
but you can fulfill i think in addition

664
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:14,640
experience in cultivation of cannabis

665
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:17,038
and the compliance with the gacp

666
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:20,080
guidelines gscp it means good

667
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:22,839
agriculture and collection practice and

668
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:25,199
the attention to

669
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:26,480
sustainability and

670
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,840
ecology

671
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,759
will pay off

672
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,038
and at last

673
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:32,319
it would be

674
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:34,798
easier

675
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:35,839
but it's not a condition that

676
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:38,599
it's

677
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:40,000
a cannabis product of swiss origin

678
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:43,199
[Music]

679
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,599
that complies with the swiss rules of

680
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,480
organic farming

681
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,599
so

682
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,759
if you want i can give you some detailed

683
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:54,158
information later especially i have a

684
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:55,679
checklist prepared

685
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,679
for

686
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,400
producers growers

687
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,720
they have the interest to go into the

688
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,000
swiss market especially

689
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,839
for the approval for the pilot

690
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,839
pilot

691
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:13,119
trials

692
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:15,278
okay thank you so much juana i hope

693
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:17,278
switzerland move

694
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:20,798
forward to get the

695
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:22,159
integral regulation sooner than later

696
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:25,359
thank you so much

697
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:28,080
to to add to two lines about the

698
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:30,479
situation in spain we still have a lot

699
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,519
of work to do we are working on it

700
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,839
but

701
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:37,918
the use of medical and recreational

702
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:39,359
cannabis in spain is not regulated yet

703
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,919
the latest works

704
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:44,158
sorry the latest news is that an expert

705
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,399
commission to talk about

706
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,600
medical cannabis just started two days

707
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:50,879
ago it will work until june let's see

708
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:53,839
what happened

709
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,760
let's see see positive and wait for the

710
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:58,398
for the result

711
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,960
our cbd cbd market is not

712
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:03,839
regulated either in spain

713
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,159
there is a really big cbd market in

714
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:08,079
spain you can find different products if

715
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,240
you go around the city you will see so

716
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:12,240
many shops you can find flowers you can

717
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,159
find c videos you can find cosmetics

718
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,240
products maybe some

719
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,840
food supplement either but as i said

720
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,120
it's not regulated all these companies

721
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,959
are working in a in a grey

722
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:26,879
area but

723
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,558
the market is getting bigger and bigger

724
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,559
even more after the

725
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:33,678
european court resolution

726
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:36,960
like almost two years ago so i cannot

727
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,399
wait for the european union regulate at

728
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,840
least

729
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:41,918
cbd

730
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:43,038
sooner than that later also we have in

731
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,679
spain

732
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:47,359
some companies growing medical

733
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,320
cannabis but the companies these

734
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:52,959
companies have to export the product to

735
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:55,839
a legal markets with an

736
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,399
authorized or a legal distributor that's

737
00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:00,158
how the situation in

738
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:01,359
in spain

739
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,240
now we can

740
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,678
keep going and let's talk about the

741
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,120
second

742
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,798
point of this

743
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:10,479
panel let's talk about

744
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:13,599
licensing requirements

745
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,278
so please chloe let us let us know what

746
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:16,798
do we need to

747
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:18,398
get a license in

748
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,839
the united states

749
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:20,879
absolutely

750
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:22,798
so

751
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,039
just like pretty much everything in the

752
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:27,440
united states related to cannabis it

753
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:28,960
really differs substantially from state

754
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,919
to state

755
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,079
there are some common threads though so

756
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,120
those are what i'll focus on

757
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:39,519
so first of all the most boring one but

758
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:41,759
the business basics so you have to have

759
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:44,798
business formation documents usually

760
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:47,519
insurance tax accounts etc i think

761
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:49,918
that's pretty typical

762
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,558
the second thing is

763
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:55,038
your team and a lot of documents related

764
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:57,038
to your team so

765
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:59,440
what your team consists of depends on

766
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:02,000
the state how they define it

767
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,320
but it's typically owners

768
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,398
people who are operating the business or

769
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:09,119
controlling the business financial

770
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:12,558
interest holders and in some cases

771
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:14,319
employees contractors etc so i think one

772
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:15,839
of the things that always shocks people

773
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:18,480
when they start to get into the

774
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:19,439
licensing process in cannabis and in the

775
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,079
us

776
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,399
is that if you are an owner or one of

777
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:25,759
the other people who needs to make

778
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,398
disclosures

779
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:30,879
you are going to have a very deep dive

780
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:32,158
into your background so i'll give you

781
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,120
one example

782
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,960
um in a state that i previously worked

783
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:39,759
in

784
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,159
there were requests for the tax returns

785
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:44,798
for the last five years not just of

786
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,520
owners but of their spouses and for

787
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:49,759
every business that they have any amount

788
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:50,798
of business interest in so

789
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:55,359
that's like

790
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:58,558
an unbelievable amount of documentation

791
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:59,359
also some states require the team to

792
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:01,759
meet

793
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:04,079
professional standards so

794
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,038
you may have to have a chemist on board

795
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:07,918
or

796
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:11,679
something along those lines

797
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,840
finally states also sometimes try to

798
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,320
limit ownership only to people who are

799
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:19,599
local to that state but that often gets

800
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:22,558
struck down in courts of law

801
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:24,240
so beyond team property is probably the

802
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:25,200
most critical thing

803
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,200
so

804
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,519
locking down a property early very

805
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,000
important you also have to typically

806
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,079
have local zoning or land use

807
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,919
authorizations to go along with that

808
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:39,439
property

809
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:41,360
so property control is a must

810
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,679
whether current or conditioned on

811
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:45,759
licensure and highly recommend

812
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,559
conditioned on licensure because there's

813
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:50,960
often lawsuits so if you locked on a

814
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:53,519
property you may be paying a lease for

815
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,480
two years three years while lawsuits are

816
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,640
being

817
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,360
resolved

818
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,120
once you have all of that taken care of

819
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:04,079
then you typically have to prepare a

820
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:06,158
facility design a construction schedule

821
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:09,119
because there's often especially in new

822
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:12,080
markets a lot of interest in how quickly

823
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:14,558
you can get to market

824
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:17,278
funding is also a critical thing and the

825
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:19,440
amount of funding that you have to have

826
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:22,159
in order to apply differs greatly from

827
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,640
state to state but we've seen you know

828
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,440
having to have two million dollars in

829
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:30,880
liquid capital in a bank account so it

830
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,880
can be quite substantial

831
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,200
you also have to have plans of

832
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:38,079
operations or what we refer to as

833
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,558
narratives so you could submit standard

834
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:43,119
operating procedures in some cases but

835
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,798
you typically don't want to in order to

836
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:48,319
protect your your

837
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:50,879
processes so you end up preparing these

838
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:52,798
very detailed descriptions of exactly

839
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,840
what you're going to do in your business

840
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:56,879
so

841
00:32:53,839 --> 00:33:00,000
cultivation manufacturing dispensing but

842
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,080
also things like security

843
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
community impact

844
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:06,158
and so many other things

845
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,319
so that's where consultants often come

846
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:11,440
into play because sometimes applications

847
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,558
can be a thousand plus pages

848
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,640
um

849
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:16,720
they're also local supports really

850
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,640
important so you may have to actually

851
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,278
have a letter of support from the local

852
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,799
government or some type of local license

853
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:25,119
depending on what the application

854
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:27,759
requirements are

855
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:30,319
and finally things that set you apart so

856
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:32,960
that may be partnerships research that

857
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:34,398
you're doing philanthropy environmental

858
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,159
initiatives

859
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:38,239
diversity equity and inclusion

860
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:41,679
initiatives it really just depends on

861
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,798
what your company specializes in

862
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,200
so

863
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:48,158
now i'll just go over a few pieces of

864
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,960
pieces of advice for how to win

865
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,120
in these competitive markets so

866
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,759
first play to your strengths

867
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:57,038
but also understand what the state is

868
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:59,599
looking for

869
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:02,558
so i think it's really critical to

870
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:04,240
analyze public meetings laws and

871
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:07,359
regulations

872
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,599
application materials and also who are

873
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:14,000
the key players who are involved both in

874
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:16,159
regulating cannabis writing the laws etc

875
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,480
and understanding by reading between the

876
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:22,000
lines what the priorities are and what

877
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,838
they're looking for in a licensee

878
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,918
then you can find where you can deliver

879
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:28,078
based on your unique value that you

880
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:30,480
bring as a company

881
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,720
second if you are in a competitive

882
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,878
licensing process you absolutely must

883
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:37,199
distinguish yourself

884
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:39,279
you cannot just rely on the bare minimum

885
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,279
of what they're asking for

886
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,800
i had clients in the past say oh you

887
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,560
know what i'm just going to give them

888
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,720
exactly what they're asking for across

889
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:49,279
the board and i can tell you those

890
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:52,719
clients pretty much always fail you have

891
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:55,760
to go above and beyond in every regard

892
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:57,679
if it's a lottery process you should be

893
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,280
strategic and consider the fact that

894
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:02,399
it's a numbers game

895
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,960
so if there are geographic limits and

896
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,119
you can only apply once in different

897
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,079
geographies you should probably apply

898
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,358
once in each geography

899
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,560
also

900
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:17,279
if you can apply both in populated areas

901
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:19,838
and less populated areas that's also a

902
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,160
pretty good strategy because if the pool

903
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:24,000
is smaller your probability of winning

904
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:26,879
is higher

905
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,199
finally expect lawsuits don't lock

906
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,440
yourself into anything that

907
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:33,199
is going to drain you financially if you

908
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,720
have to wait for two or three years

909
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:38,078
while legal matters are resolved

910
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,799
thank you very much

911
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,240
kai please whatever yeah maybe maybe i

912
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,519
can add i can

913
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:45,838
agree on

914
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:47,440
most points except of the lottery system

915
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:49,838
i can't understand that

916
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,519
but i can add to uh we only have the

917
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:52,880
draft in germany the cannabis control

918
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:54,800
act by the greens

919
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,240
this is the blueprint

920
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:01,760
because it's a complete law it's really

921
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:04,159
60 70 pages long export import free

922
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,240
market model everything is regulated it

923
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:08,399
will also be a federal law so there

924
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:09,838
won't be any interstate restriction

925
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,680
interstate commercial commerce

926
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:14,078
restrictions

927
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:17,440
and you can have as much licenses as you

928
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:20,480
want to when you get one in the end okay

929
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:23,679
but what is also clear is that the staff

930
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,760
members this stuff has to be trained

931
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:28,480
the ministry of justice the secretary of

932
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,320
justice has confirmed that it's the

933
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,719
basic thought of the cannabis control

934
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,440
act is the social responsibility

935
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:37,679
of this act so you get the free market

936
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,119
you get the legalized market but on the

937
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:42,529
other hand to regulate that to

938
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,800
to yeah to to

939
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:47,280
[Music]

940
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,359
fight the

941
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,400
negative consequences you have to have

942
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:54,319
strict social responsibilities in place

943
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,559
so this stuff has to be trained the

944
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,960
staff has to have a certificate of

945
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:01,759
responsible selling in the end no one

946
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,880
knows yet how intense and how long these

947
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,640
education

948
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,280
will look like will be

949
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:10,000
we will have to look at the us or canada

950
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,640
for other examples for example but the

951
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,440
law says the the staff member has to

952
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:16,078
know

953
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,119
about how cannabis works and about

954
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,240
prevention or opportunity options

955
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,400
they have to

956
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:24,479
identify risky

957
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,480
consummation patterns with their clients

958
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,838
then they have to talk to them about it

959
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,880
with their clients

960
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:30,400
etc

961
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,960
and the shops have to have a social

962
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,200
concept in place so they have to have in

963
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,639
written a concept how they will fit in

964
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:38,719
their community

965
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:41,759
in the neighborhood and what are they

966
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:43,358
doing about prevention and drug

967
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,960
addiction and

968
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:47,679
they have to have

969
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,639
they have to be affiliated with the

970
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:51,919
drug prevention associations etc etc so

971
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:54,480
the whole set

972
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,159
of regulations concerning the social

973
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,719
responsibility

974
00:37:56,159 --> 00:38:01,279
but we have to work this out

975
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:03,279
as well this year next year the details

976
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,119
how intense it will be

977
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,960
but this will come

978
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,800
hi uh

979
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,240
hi

980
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,440
michael sorry

981
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:12,879
we have to stop

982
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,280
uh no

983
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,800
thank you for your expertise kai um

984
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,880
we are soon

985
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,400
we come to the end now but uh like

986
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,480
always we have to give the audience the

987
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,160
chance to ask a few questions or at

988
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,400
least one question i think there's not

989
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:28,559
more time than one question so if

990
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,400
there's a question please

991
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:33,838
i see there's one question

992
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,838
i'll give you the microphone

993
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:41,279
yes thank you mr newman

994
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:44,240
you mentioned about the dispensaries and

995
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,800
shopping in germany but what about the

996
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:51,118
growing licenses in germany as i know

997
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,960
there is a 13 watts in 2019

998
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,480
after the last tender

999
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,199
are they planning

1000
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,199
to

1001
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:59,118
give more licensing

1002
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:01,919
in this draft i don't know

1003
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,680
yeah the cultivation is also possible

1004
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,119
according to this draft

1005
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:07,598
for sure

1006
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,838
but i doubt that

1007
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:12,000
cultivating of recreational cannabis in

1008
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:14,400
germany has a future

1009
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
because we have a demand of 400 to 600

1010
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,240
tons on

1011
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,199
for for dried flowers alone

1012
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:20,000
so

1013
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:22,399
you

1014
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,119
would have to set up facilities and

1015
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,440
plants for cultivation like we see them

1016
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,599
in switzerland with big investments with

1017
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,400
20 25 million

1018
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,720
we would need 20 30 facilities of these

1019
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,240
two to cover the demand domestically i

1020
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:38,000
don't think this makes sense from a

1021
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:38,799
climate perspective as well because

1022
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,920
these

1023
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,000
facilities are really energy consuming

1024
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,760
and there are many many facilities all

1025
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,760
over the world in lisotto in south

1026
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,839
africa colombia

1027
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,320
north macedonia they have their

1028
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:54,159
facilities in place they have better

1029
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,400
wetter weather conditions

1030
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:58,879
so germany think we'll have to rely on

1031
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,000
on imports for a long time or for for

1032
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,519
most of the most of the material

1033
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,719
and we have

1034
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:09,119
three domestic licenses granted in 2019

1035
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:11,679

1036
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,920

1037
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:15,039
cannabis a medical cannabis export

1038
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,480
nation

1039
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:21,199

um cultivation

1043
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:29,440

1044
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:30,879
germany can also supply uh in in

1045
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,880

the the medical cannabis market globally

1047
