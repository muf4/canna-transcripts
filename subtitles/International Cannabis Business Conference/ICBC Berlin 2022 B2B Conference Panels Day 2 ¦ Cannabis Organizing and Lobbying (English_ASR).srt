1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,480
um so yeah i'm really looking forward to

2
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:11,279
this conversation actually and to kind

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,039
of around everybody and where everyone

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,480
is coming from before we tell you what

5
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,480
our backgrounds are and where we're

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,560
coming from just like a show of hands

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,079
how many people are actually

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:23,679
making a living from cannabis right now

9
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,439
some sort of revenue or something

10
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,759
awesome how many people are kind of like

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,879
just activists or

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,880
um

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:34,000
very few

14
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:36,879
clint of course of course

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,920
um okay yeah so we're we're mostly from

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,079
west coast of north america and i'm from

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,920
vancouver and british columbia

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,600
where i hope dispensaries get licensed

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,559
there before legalization and then have

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,640
been kind of slowly changing certain

21
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:53,839
laws and licensing classes and things

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,878
like that since legalization um we have

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,559
people from california from arizona

24
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,640
i think it kind of the easiest way i

25
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,799
mean obviously their bios are very

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,320
impressive and they are in the program

27
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,759
um but i'd like to just kind of start

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,839
off by saying you know who are you

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,760
advocating for and what are you

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,719
advocating

31
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,359
um hi i'm luna stower i'm with ispire

32
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,000
and uh who am i advocating for the

33
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,799
people and the plan i think that um you

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,438
know access purity wellness this is all

35
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,600
what we come here for um and this is so

36
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,039
much bigger than just the plant so as

37
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,399
we're seeing a lot of darkness in the

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,560
world right now we really believe that

39
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,719
plant medicine is our pathway to higher

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,040
consciousness and a higher way of living

41
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,560
it's not just about the buzz or the

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,799
medical benefits

43
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,478
it really is about liberation and

44
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,600
sovereignty and autonomy and that's you

45
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:43,780
know the human rights issue that we're

46
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:47,438
fighting for

47
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:49,359
[Applause]

48
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,879
hi i'm brigitte hennessey i'm with weed

49
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,040
maps

50
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,359
and who we are fighting for and what we

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,399
really dive into is making sure that we

52
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,799
have

53
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,718
an open diverse and transparent cannabis

54
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,680
economy around the world

55
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,959
and so we have really leaned into that

56
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,880
and made sure that we are fighting for

57
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,878
that every single day

58
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,799
and for those who are not familiar with

59
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,280
me max i should just quickly say we are

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,280
a tech company in the cannabis space so

61
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,120
we don't directly touch the plant but we

62
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,759
are here to power the industry with and

63
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,400
give the industry tools to perform as

64
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,399
efficient as possible

65
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,958
hi everyone my name is matt cumin i'm an

66
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,800
attorney i've been

67
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,439
in the cannabis space since the late

68
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,280
1990s in the bay areas where i started

69
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,598
we have office in new york recently

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,120
opened um

71
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,679
my advocacy

72
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,519
changed over the years initially i was

73
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,400
advocating for medical cannabis patients

74
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,400
we were

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,840
suing governments for you know

76
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,319
discriminating against patients in

77
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,000
california some

78
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:52,958
federal governments who

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,360
state

80
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,519
kent state county cities

81
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,280
then uh

82
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,360
i got very involved in political action

83
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,519
committee in california we advocated for

84
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,560
cultivators up in the emerald triangle

85
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,000
we were

86
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,000
bringing them together and formed a

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,120
political action committee in humboldt

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,280
county and other places when we brought

89
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,599
the pac down to los angeles and

90
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,598
essentially trying to organize

91
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,318
the business community that was going to

92
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:22,158
be affected by the changing laws

93
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,958
and uh

94
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:28,079
so all along the way we've been you know

95
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,680
the advocacy is changing and now

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,480
ultimately the advocacy is really about

97
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,519
fixing the broken laws that

98
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:40,158
we've seen you know canada and

99
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,080
california and other many other places i

100
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,199
know dominic's going to talk about that

101
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,719
a lot

102
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,399
and we're just trying to fix the broken

103
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:49,039
laws so that we can really make sure

104
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,239
that there is even more access

105
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,158
free

106
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,480
unhindered access to cannabis

107
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,840
throughout the world and that's i think

108
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:01,840
the next big

109
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,840
big advocacy for me

110
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,438
demetri downing i'm an ex-prosecutor got

111
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,680
involved in the industry in 2012

112
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,598
in a sort of general council role for my

113
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,719
brothers and my dad's dispensaries in

114
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,839
arizona

115
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:18,639
uh 2012 2015 i studied cannabis

116
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,399
regulations licensing market structures

117
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,400
uh came to some conclusions which i

118
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:26,239
found out later through my work with

119
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,519
normal were the wrong conclusions got my

120
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,759
head on straight

121
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,478
started the marijuana association of

122
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,879
arizona which is which became known as

123
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:37,039
one of the best ones in the state uh

124
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,759
interests of interstate siloed markets

125
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,800
of the united states and we evolved it

126
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,400
into marijuana industry association usa

127
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,600
and we've been developing that over the

128
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,679
last year

129
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,560
and um well we do a lot of different

130
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,319
things application advocacy education

131
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,199
business networking

132
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:58,159
but if i can leave you with one thing

133
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,639
we have to fight as an industry

134
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,639
as the future members of an industry

135
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,840
participants in industry employees of an

136
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,199
industry

137
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:09,359
fight the concept of limited licensing

138
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,240
because that is an economic abomination

139
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,919
that we have inherited

140
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,600
through the good work of mpp but

141
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,359
inadvertently not understanding

142
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,600
economics and market structure actually

143
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,479
they probably understood them

144
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,240
just to appease those who hate cannabis

145
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:25,918
limited licensing was created and for

146
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,240
most people that i have met

147
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,319
uh in the industry it um

148
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,680
it's just it's not a favorable result

149
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,360
and it's definitely not a favorable

150
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,560
result for the patients and the

151
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,650
consumers but we can talk more about

152
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,959
that as we go so to meet you

153
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:43,120
[Applause]

154
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,879
raises a point that i was referring to a

155
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,879
couple of years ago in an icbc

156
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,439
conference with with george worth and

157
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,439
burkhardt blind on the stage i said that

158
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,199
that lobbying for cannabis regulations

159
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,959
with politicians was like playing chess

160
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,800
with the pigeon it doesn't really matter

161
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,159
who wins they're still gonna knock over

162
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,038
all the pieces and all over the

163
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,800
board

164
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,279
um people took that as a little more

165
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,038
pessimistic i think but i it was very

166
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,879
interesting our conversation backstage

167
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,959
where we've all kind of talked about

168
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,719
we've seen such amazing progress in our

169
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,439
lifetimes and and

170
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,919
so many more people have access

171
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:18,079
although we've also seen things drop

172
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,918
like in bc for example you know there

173
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,560
used to be better access for a lot of

174
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:24,560
patients particularly poor patients um

175
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,639
when things were still illegal and now

176
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,560
that we've gotten to legalization those

177
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,759
things have gone backwards and so what

178
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,399
are some of the other things that you

179
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,639
see that have been frustrating and what

180
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,038
kind of keeps you motivated to stay

181
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,240
positive and keep moving

182
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,120
yeah i would say a lot of the

183
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,680
frustrations um for us definitely comes

184
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,038
from not having pathways for medicine

185
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,360
and that's not really a conversation

186
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,839
anymore right it's recreational now

187
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,199
we had to pass a senate bill 34 just to

188
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,598
be able to do what we were doing before

189
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,919
which is getting to ill people patients

190
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,279
veterans um so yeah i mean that's a huge

191
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,359
part of what we do

192
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:02,079
um ice fire works in the in the hardware

193
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,400
space so much like we maps we don't

194
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:06,800
touch the plan we just do the hardware

195
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:09,120
for the vape industry so we can really

196
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,960
uh be able to put our our resources and

197
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,240
our energy and our advocacy behind

198
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,159
certain things that other cannabis

199
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,280
companies cannot because they you know

200
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,319
all the limitations that they have

201
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,399
around banking advertising cash flow um

202
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,840
so that's been a really exciting thing

203
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,038
to be able to have ancillary be able to

204
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,318
come in and show up for the um you know

205
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:27,918
the consciousness raising side the

206
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,720
lobbying side the organizing side

207
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:33,680
because really there's no there's no pr

208
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,479
group or psa for cannabis no one's

209
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,720
really arguing in her voice it's either

210
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,120
industry advocates or patients who want

211
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,960
low pricing it's not really what's best

212
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,319
and what's in the nature of this plan so

213
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,758
i think that the thing that keeps me the

214
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,840
most happy and we talked about this

215
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,360
backstage too is you know just the

216
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,198
networking doing what we're doing here

217
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,038
it's a radical act during a time of

218
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,520
pandemic to come out and be around other

219
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,639
people and fight for medical autonomy

220
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:00,159
and advocacy during a time of medical

221
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,759
fascism in a lot of ways people are

222
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,759
controlling everything about our medical

223
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,160
passports and what we have access to

224
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,160
from food to medicine and beyond so what

225
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,080
keeps me feeling happy is seeing that

226
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,840
much like the way that the plant grows

227
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,199
in uh you know an interconnected way in

228
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,198
this environment we're doing that as

229
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,478
well making sure that we're staying

230
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,879
buoyant that we're connecting with each

231
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,959
other we don't compete it's not us

232
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,039
versus each other it's cooperation

233
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,120
there's enough for all of us here and so

234
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:29,279
i think that's what gives me hope is

235
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,759
that despite the obvious um tyranny of

236
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,679
you know uh of the government against

237
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,680
people being as autonomous and free as

238
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,038
possible we're still learning from this

239
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,799
plant we're still allowing it to open

240
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:40,240
our hearts and our minds and see that

241
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,000
this is not like other industries this

242
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,918
is not a consumer package good you can't

243
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
just treat this like alcohol tobacco

244
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:49,278
it's a magical mystical medicinal plan

245
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,278
when you start acting like it

246
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,399
yeah i would say that um when i think

247
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:57,200
about it i you know i feel overall very

248
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,399
optimistic because when we start seeing

249
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,080
legalization take place in new areas or

250
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,080
you know they're starting down this path

251
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,920
they are looking to the established

252
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,920
markets and trying to understand where

253
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,519
some of the pitfalls are i think one of

254
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:10,958
the biggest mistakes we've seen in some

255
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,799
of the early

256
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,639
movers was really

257
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,958
not bringing the legacy market to the

258
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,240
table and having their voice heard it

259
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,079
was a bunch of people that were trying

260
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,919
to learn about the plan or learn about

261
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,240
legalization from a very business

262
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,240
setting and so i think we're doing a

263
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,320
better job and i i'm very hopeful that

264
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,759
we'll continue down this path if

265
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,080
and the legacy market isn't an

266
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,000
afterthought we don't establish a market

267
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,519
and establish regulations and policy and

268
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,799
then think later like oh we should

269
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,560
probably talk to the people that have

270
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,399
been in this for 20 years in the illicit

271
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,559
market like we should be having them at

272
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,159
the table from the outset and i think

273
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:45,919
we're seeing states like new york that

274
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,838
actually got that and understood it and

275
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,240
are going to implement a law that is

276
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,399
just that so i think overall it's

277
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,759
hopeful it's slow

278
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,039
but hopeful i think that we're going to

279
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,278
get there and it's just going to take

280
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:57,278
time

281
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,680
um

282
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,919
and and

283
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,560
[Music]

284
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,479
hats off to weak maps and they put their

285
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,958
money where their mouth is and

286
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,519
that dovetails into one of the trends

287
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:14,078
that i've seen in terms of success

288
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,078
um it's businesses that

289
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,078
integrate the advocacy

290
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,278
that is still necessary in order to make

291
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:21,439
this

292
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:23,679
not only politically and socially and

293
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,440
culturally you know acceptable and get

294
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:26,799
rid of stigma but also to help create

295
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,720
their own markets

296
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,639
and if you bring legacy people in and

297
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,440
marry them correctly with your your

298
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:35,600
finance people your mbas and you develop

299
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,200
a working team uh then i think you

300
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,440
actually have massive success and

301
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,399
actually as a side note to that i went

302
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,640
to a

303
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,240
seminar it wasn't about cannabis but it

304
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:45,199
was about

305
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,360
um

306
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,000
someone was tracking uh

307
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,639
publicly traded companies that had big

308
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,480
budgets for lobbying and political work

309
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,319
and those companies actually did better

310
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,000
you know from a profit standpoint so i

311
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,680
mean if you're if you're a company and

312
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,278
you think well advocacy is an

313
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,359
afterthought or that we're not going to

314
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:04,799
spend money on advocacy it's a mistake

315
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,120
because you actually will help create

316
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:09,278
your markets and you'll build uh not

317
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,360
only build your markets and open your

318
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:13,600
markets but you'll also be able to help

319
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,759
the larger political and social cultural

320
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,240
goals that we're trying to achieve

321
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,240
yeah i'll go ahead and one trick tony

322
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,159
you know i'm incredibly

323
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,159
the world is upside down from where it

324
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,078
was back on arizona and california it's

325
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:28,639
unbelievable the amount of patient

326
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:31,759
access and consumer access and choice

327
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,278
that exists now that as opposed to 15 20

328
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,360
years ago

329
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,919
but i've always just wanted to stick to

330
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,240
the same basic point as a trade

331
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,879
organization you know it's everyone from

332
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,200
a bud tender with a dream to an owner

333
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:48,159
with an exit strategy and you have to

334
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,879
advance the rights of all those people

335
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:54,159
every employee and their ability to one

336
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:58,159
day be an owner themselves and limited

337
00:11:54,159 --> 00:12:00,240
licensing barriers to entry prevent that

338
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,600
and that's one of the biggest things

339
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,240
that's happening in the cannabis

340
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,639
industry that we as members of the

341
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,519
cannabis industry need to advocate

342
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,000
against and educate against and germany

343
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,919
hasn't set things up yet but you know if

344
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,440
there's one thing i can leave you with

345
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:20,879
limited licensing means drug war 2.0

346
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,880
means prohibition 2.0 there have to be

347
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:26,240
civil and criminal sanctions in place to

348
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:28,720
punish these people that's not what the

349
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,720
members of this industry should want

350
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,959
advocate for and it's not ultimately

351
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,278
what's in the best interest of executing

352
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,879
their hopes and their dreams and it's

353
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,399
not what's in the best interests of

354
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,639
creating competition

355
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,039
innovation and better products for

356
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,440
patients and consumers so again being

357
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:48,000
the one trick prone i'm extremely

358
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,279
optimistic i'm an ex-prosecutor it's

359
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,879
incredible

360
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,439
what's happened

361
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:56,639
unbelievable amazing come to california

362
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,680
come to arizona it's beautiful

363
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,680
but

364
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:02,479
there's a lot of work to be done and

365
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:06,159
media usa is here to help do that

366
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,560
okay can i say something no i i

367
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:10,958
graduated college a long time ago i'd

368
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,958
become the old old guy on the panel here

369
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,759
a little behind me

370
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,838
and

371
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:18,879
um i immediately went became a labor and

372
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,480
community organizer and over the years i

373
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:22,559
fundamentally was trained and

374
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,000
fundamentally my passions are about

375
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,638
organizing

376
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,120
and over the years i've just seen what

377
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,519
happens when people come together

378
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,799
even a small group you know

379
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,200
have an idea

380
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,120
and then they organize around it and

381
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,879
it's amazing i mean

382
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,639
in the cannabis space one of the things

383
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,639
we did in uh

384
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,879
in

385
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:46,480
2009 the state of maine came out with an

386
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:47,439
ethical rule that said that lawyers

387
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,000
could

388
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,440
represent dispensaries in maine

389
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,759
and you know

390
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,880
i called up you know and then the maine

391
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:59,439
bar association went over to arizona

392
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,838
actually and we i flew to phoenix and we

393
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,240
met at the aclu headquarters and a bunch

394
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,320
of criminal defense lawyers i knew and

395
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,480
immediately started organizing and we

396
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,320
reached out to people in the main

397
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,320
and the arizona bar association we

398
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,519
organized like crazy and they

399
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,199
they ended up

400
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,799
arizona bar association wrote one of

401
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:18,879
those brilliant

402
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,639
ethics opinions that said lawyers you

403
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,720
know should be allowed and it was really

404
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,919
important and and because we organized

405
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,839
because we we wrote papers and we got

406
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,120
law professors to help and

407
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,760
it

408
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,879
is no question that you can advocate and

409
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,919
organize

410
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:38,639
to the positive results but it does

411
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:41,198
require you to you know to

412
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,600
sit down with people you might have a

413
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:45,359
disagreement with and work out how your

414
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,360
strategy is going to go but it's

415
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,440
absolutely possible we did amazing i was

416
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,680
in mississippi we organized black

417
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,240
woodcutters who had no money in power to

418
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,159
change legislation in the state i mean

419
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,639
anything's possible if you work next

420
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,559
that's basically my message

421
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,480
yeah what we've been seeing in canada is

422
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:05,518
sort of the industry bifurcating a

423
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,959
little um into two camps and and uh it's

424
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,560
interesting you know dimitri keeps

425
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,838
bringing up the limited licensing issues

426
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:14,159
that they're having in states and it's

427
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,560
it's it's a fundamental

428
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:19,278
issue of how you approach your

429
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,759
competition you know are they actually

430
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:23,919
competition or are they on your same

431
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:26,799
side in the long run and

432
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:28,559
how do you encourage that in an industry

433
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:29,838
that's filling up with people you know

434
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,359
in canada

435
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,000
in the last couple of months we've had

436
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,159
some stores starting to advocate to go

437
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,278
and arrest shutting down indigenous

438
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:39,519
stores

439
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,838
without any idea of what what their

440
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,519
sovereignty is like or you know anything

441
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,959
like that and um

442
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,039
that's

443
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,958
that's something that while we've been

444
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,958
seeing that happen large producers are

445
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,559
getting away without even getting fines

446
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,479
or anything it's like we don't want to

447
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,159
see anybody go to jail but if you're

448
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,519
going to have rules you should follow

449
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,198
the rules um obviously indigenous stores

450
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,278
fall under a different category because

451
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,758
we still haven't figured out exactly

452
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:07,600
what that sovereignty looks like but um

453
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,839
how does that issue strike you like how

454
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,680
do you how do you build those bridges or

455
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,040
do we just wait until they're all pushed

456
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:16,159
out all the people that don't want to

457
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,159
work with anybody else

458
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,078
i mean i think

459
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:23,679
in my role at weed maps we've had to

460
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:26,319
deal with this a lot because we

461
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:28,799
we were supportive of the legacy

462
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,759
and industry we've been around for 15

463
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:31,758
years

464
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,919
and so when

465
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,639
places like california started moving to

466
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,759
an adult use model and started to

467
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,759
regulate

468
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,560
we had really hard conversations with

469
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,240
our clients and we had to be open with

470
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,479
the fact that you know we are going to

471
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,519
push for a very open market and some of

472
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,800
you guys are going to feel really

473
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,799
uncomfortable with that because we want

474
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,799
to see everybody win here we don't want

475
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:55,838
to see just five or ten companies

476
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:58,319
winning the entire industry and we often

477
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,320
will be at odds with our clients

478
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,000
we're sort of unapologetic about it at

479
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,759
this point we treat it very

480
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
diplomatically we will go in and have

481
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,360
that hard conversation but and we'll

482
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
hear them out and hear their point of

483
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,759
view and try to explain you know we we

484
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,679
look at the data we can tell you that

485
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,919
the data is there to say there's plenty

486
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,519
of demand for the industry so

487
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,520
everybody's going to do well that we all

488
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,439
have to work together with one voice

489
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:22,959
it takes time and people have to start

490
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,558
building trust but i think the

491
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,720
relationship building having honest

492
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:28,879
conversations looking at the data you

493
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,640
can get there just it's a work in

494
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,320
progress all the time and

495
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,759
we will lose some relationships over

496
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:35,519
that but you have to be okay and know

497
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:38,079
that you're working you're heading the

498
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,400
right direction the whole time

499
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,960
and remember when i we were talking you

500
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,880
know government is the enemy government

501
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,480
deserves the black market it creates

502
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,880
through its restrictions and through its

503
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,880
limited licensing and we will it's

504
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,200
winning we're winning all the time

505
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,080
because whatever whatever we can't

506
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,919
organize well enough to create and and

507
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,599
get rid of these restrictions

508
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,360
well the consumers are going to go get

509
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:02,719
their cannabis in the black market

510
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,839
that's just the way it is it's going to

511
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,839
always be that way it's going to be that

512
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,439
way in germany it's been that way in

513
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:09,359
europe and it's going to continue to be

514
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,519
that way so we win

515
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:13,918
the plant wins either way

516
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:16,480
it gets out there

517
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,480
and i was always telling my legacy to my

518
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,720
clients up in the emerald triangle i

519
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,038
said you guys you know you you planted

520
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,200
the seeds of your own of your own demise

521
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:27,359
because the consumers saw that little

522
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,080
green bud from california and they went

523
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,079
crazy around the world for it and that's

524
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:34,319
you know part of what happened but it's

525
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,599
it's on fire now there's no going back

526
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,480
yeah to your point about northern

527
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,918
california exporting all of our cool

528
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,519
um something really interesting that i

529
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,440
want to mention too that makes sense in

530
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,679
europe because of the appellations of

531
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,120
origin for wine

532
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,640
you'll notice that you can't call

533
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,558
something champagne unless it's from the

534
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,080
champagne region bordeaux

535
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:53,918
so something that frenchie cannoli the

536
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:56,399
late great hashishin who is no longer

537
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,320
with us but i always was talking about

538
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,280
the terroir and

539
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:03,599
the place the spirit of the soil the air

540
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:05,519
the water the genetics and the love that

541
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,678
the people in northern california put

542
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,679
into it through regenerative farming and

543
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,880
the energetics of really working with a

544
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,880
plant that they know that they're making

545
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,559
for medicine and having decades and

546
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,400
decades and generations of people doing

547
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:17,839
that work um i think that that's

548
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,400
something that can really set folks

549
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:22,480
apart um you can't just put cali on a

550
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,400
mylar bag and call it cali and have

551
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,079
people you know believe that we i think

552
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,720
that that's something that can help us

553
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,480
as far as cooperation goes is really

554
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,558
finding other people that have the same

555
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,400
message you know with that is something

556
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:35,918
simple is when we do our dab bars we

557
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,400
always have a concentrate sponsor that

558
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,000
has a mission that we relate to

559
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,679
um you know we always have you know

560
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,119
another you know dynavap is another

561
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,880
partner that technically is a competitor

562
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:46,239
but we're partners now we use each

563
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,320
other's in you know induction heating

564
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,640
for their dynavap piece or the dip

565
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:52,240
device folks like it doesn't it doesn't

566
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,000
have to be limiting it's not we're

567
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,599
larger than the sum of our parts and i

568
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,519
think that once we start seeing people

569
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:58,798
come together and use common language

570
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:00,798
that's the one thing i really want to

571
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,400
say to the europeans out here trying to

572
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:04,798
legislate and trying to move this

573
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,400
forward is you know talk to each other

574
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:07,519
get on the same page

575
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,440
a lot of what happened with us in

576
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:10,798
california was we did a lot of sloppy

577
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,279
infighting right in front of the

578
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:15,519
legislators and it was really bad it

579
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,759
allowed vermont's uh philip morris and

580
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,918
some of these bigger players that the no

581
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,359
acreage caps came in and just decimated

582
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,799
us because they came in in their suits

583
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:24,319
they were really buttoned up they were

584
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,079
really respectable they spoke the same

585
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,558
language and we look like a bunch of

586
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,240
wild wacky hippies that were infighting

587
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,399
um so i think that that's the biggest

588
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,279
thing that i've seen is utilizing trade

589
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,559
organizations like me to um talking to

590
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,639
these you know people that you think are

591
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:40,480
your enemies like matt said you know

592
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,240
these people are on your side having

593
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,240
that hard conversation now is gonna save

594
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,599
you a lot of pain um from down the road

595
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,359
when you're trying to undo some of this

596
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,199
stuff so i think that knowing what you

597
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,918
have knowing that what you grow what you

598
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,679
make is really special and finding other

599
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,440
people that are in it for the long haul

600
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,440
not folks that are exit focused that are

601
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,600
just in here to make a quick buck green

602
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,679
rush it and bounce that's not what we're

603
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:05,519
here for so just be on the lookout for

604
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,519
real family and stick with them

605
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,960
[Music]

606
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,639
and i think that it gets a little

607
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,798
overwhelming i know certainly did in

608
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,960
canada where it suddenly was the mining

609
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:17,839
companies throwing around stocks and

610
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,360
millions of dollars and it it can get a

611
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:20,720
little discouraging especially because

612
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:22,399
then it makes it harder for the

613
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,798
legitimate people to

614
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,519
do money and raises and things like that

615
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:27,679
but

616
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:29,519
it's we're already starting to see that

617
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,960
kind of fade out like those companies

618
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,000
can't keep running the way they're

619
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,640
running not forever um and that now that

620
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,798
we've gotten smaller license classes and

621
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,480
things like that and people have had

622
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,319
time to transition that maybe weren't

623
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,079
able to transition right away

624
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:47,279
into the legacy and into the legal

625
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:50,879
market from the legacy market um it's uh

626
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:52,558
it does get better eventually but it's

627
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,480
it's hard you know you said something

628
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,798
backstage that is exactly is the

629
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,400
insulting injury of of telling the

630
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:59,359
jurisdiction this is what's going to

631
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,280
happen

632
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,678
and then watching them do it again

633
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:06,240
anyway and it gets very frustrating to

634
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,480
see that happen again and again but you

635
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,038
know on the positive side the more that

636
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,720
optimistic outlook is that we do come

637
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,400
through the other side eventually and

638
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,480
we're starting to get there in the west

639
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,080
coast for example i mean

640
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,919
you guys are going to have issues again

641
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:21,038
when you get to federal legalization

642
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,440
because it's

643
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:25,519
you know the more you try to appease a

644
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,600
bigger group of people the worst things

645
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:29,599
ultimately get in the long run for the

646
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:30,798
people that know what's going on um to

647
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,119
meet you i notice you've been taking

648
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,319
notes uh frantically i'm just taking

649
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:35,439
those for myself really i don't know

650
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:38,000
what what

651
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,919
no well i mean again you know i'm gonna

652
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,359
be a one-trick pony you have to do

653
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,600
whatever you can

654
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,199
to fight limited licensing it creates so

655
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:47,678
many of the problems

656
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,759
our friends turning each other in

657
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,640
we know the ruthlessness and the games

658
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:54,558
that are played it makes no economic

659
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,400
sense it's an abomination

660
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:59,200
even if you're opening up a nuclear

661
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,880
power plant you can go get a license you

662
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,400
pay for it and then if you break the

663
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:07,039
rules they take away your permit

664
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,759
limited licensing merit-based licensing

665
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:13,119
deciding who has the right to retail

666
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:15,839
manufacture dispense grow all that stuff

667
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:17,839
it creates a minority report reality

668
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:19,678
remember that movie with tom cruise

669
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:21,599
where the government is trying to guess

670
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,000
who's going to do things right or who's

671
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:26,639
going to commit crimes that's exactly

672
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,400
what we're doing and it's and it's a god

673
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,080
bless the mpp i love them

674
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,840
they inadvertently did this they should

675
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:33,359
have never attached manufacturing

676
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:35,279
cultivation that they had some sort of

677
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:37,599
economic theorist working with them they

678
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:40,000
wouldn't have but it's a tragedy that

679
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:41,759
we're repeating over and over again

680
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,798
and countries like you know maybe even

681
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:43,759
germany i don't know what's going to

682
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:45,599
happen here i don't know what the

683
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:48,000
lobbying situation is and the special

684
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:49,519
interest situation is but people look in

685
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,640
the united states and say how did they

686
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,119
do it there

687
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,480
and this this this devil

688
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:57,038
exists

689
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,278
that uh you know it's damaging all kinds

690
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:01,519
of things even the legacy market

691
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:03,359
okay the legacy market if it wasn't for

692
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:04,720
such restrictive limited licensing could

693
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,319
get involved

694
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,240
you know yeah sure they have to dot more

695
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,558
eyes and cross more teas and follow more

696
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,440
rules but it's impossible for you them

697
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:16,319
to even get started in social equity in

698
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,679
arizona we have 4 000 people go through

699
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,278
all right god bless weed maps for

700
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,080
sponsoring us i have to mention they

701
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:24,079
sponsored that program um four thousand

702
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,399
people get educated they self-identified

703
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:27,759
as social equity entrepreneurs that

704
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,080
wanted to be involved in the cannabis

705
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:33,038
industry they're competing for 26

706
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:35,918
licenses 1500 were determined eligible

707
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:38,960
through a series of state determinations

708
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,640
as to what social equity is okay fine

709
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,759
fifteen hundred paid four thousand

710
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,559
dollars

711
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:47,599
twenty six of them got licenses so what

712
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:49,519
does that mean that means about 4 000

713
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:51,839
people that were motivated to get off

714
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:53,359
their ass and do something and push for

715
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:56,240
their hopes and their dreams and

716
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,599
opportunity in cannabis is what cannabis

717
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,839
should be about not just patients and

718
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:02,240
consumers and therapy and all that stuff

719
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,678
but also about a free market of

720
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,519
opportunity

721
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,278
all those are crushed

722
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,599
all those were crushed because of the

723
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:11,759
concept of limited licensing i'd rather

724
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:14,319
see those 4 000 people go get a piece of

725
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:17,119
paper screw things up get their license

726
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:19,759
revoked fail that's what cannabis should

727
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:21,359
be about and we keep i hear over and

728
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:23,119
over again in different countries and

729
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,759
different states throughout the world

730
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,359
what did colorado do how did this work

731
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:29,278
why did that work

732
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:33,678
and the problem is

733
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:35,759
limited licensing this notion needs to

734
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,440
die

735
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,919
okay

736
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,519
you know in canada we had barriers that

737
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,520
ended up being

738
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,679
very similar to that that came about

739
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:47,200
just from oh you have to have this and

740
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,880
this and this in the facility and you

741
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,400
have to have this in the facility and

742
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,000
then because there were so many people

743
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,919
that were just saying hey we applied for

744
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,400
a license so were they enlisted on the

745
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,320
stock market by our stock there was so

746
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,159
much of that that right when we were

747
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,759
allowing smaller producers in health

748
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,000
canada said okay you've got to actually

749
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,278
have a building first before we're even

750
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,440
going to look at you so then all of

751
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,440
these smaller producers and people that

752
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,200
you know especially people from from the

753
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,558
former illicit market that didn't know

754
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,720
if they were going to get security

755
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:17,200
cleared couldn't necessarily

756
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,558
build out those facilities to that level

757
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,159
and um

758
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:21,678
take it a side tangent here because i've

759
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,080
been using the word even though it's a

760
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,240
pet peeve of mine as i hate the word

761
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:27,839
legacy market because legacy is

762
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,079
something do you leave to somebody when

763
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,959
you're dead and the black market hasn't

764
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:34,960
gone anywhere it's still here it's still

765
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,679
strong in canada it's still strong in

766
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,720
california right thriving

767
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,640
actually growing up so yeah so i mean

768
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,240
it's it's and it's an interesting thing

769
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,720
to kind of watch happen especially when

770
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,400
the government's you know in canada one

771
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,278
of their main approaches was well we

772
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,720
want to

773
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:52,798
transition the

774
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,200
illicit market but then you only saw

775
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:57,119
that in basically bc every other

776
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,200
province wanted to term wipe it out and

777
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,479
replace it right i mean so

778
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,120
um

779
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,480
i had a question in there somewhere i

780
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:07,278
think it was a bridge that you had

781
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,120
brought up before um about how important

782
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:11,200
it is to fight for equity and amnesty

783
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:13,119
and that kind of touches on on some of

784
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,840
these barriers and artificial barriers

785
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:19,519
that are being raised to the industry

786
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:21,519
yeah i think one of the things that we

787
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:23,679
everybody says you know where you'll

788
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,720
hear it again and again in states or in

789
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,320
different jurisdictions that are

790
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,000
legalizing and they'll say

791
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,158
they're doing it to write them wrong

792
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,919
from the war on drugs or whatever

793
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,240
but we're not actually doing that we're

794
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,159
i mean if you look california is a great

795
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,319
example of what not to do in this area

796
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,240
because they did a lot of talking about

797
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:42,079
social equity and making sure that there

798
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,640
was room in the market for people there

799
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:47,678
was no clear definition in the policy

800
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,440
it was every jurisdiction gets to decide

801
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,519
how they're going to define it and how

802
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,960
they're going to give out those licenses

803
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:56,480
and there's no access to capital so

804
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,919
we're going to give people the space

805
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,558
we're going to say you know the city of

806
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,399
los angeles for instance said

807
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:04,240
you have to have the property in

808
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,278
possession before you can apply for a

809
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,038
license

810
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:08,640
and then they took two and a half years

811
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:11,119
to go through the first phase of

812
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,320
licensing while people paid rent on that

813
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:16,558
property how does somebody who has zero

814
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:18,558
to very little capital even

815
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:19,918
get in there and do that so

816
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:22,398
we've been fighting for that we are

817
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,600
trying to call this out as often as we

818
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:26,079
can and

819
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:28,000
i do feel hopeful in places like new

820
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,678
york where they're leading with the

821
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,599
social equity licenses those are going

822
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,038
first they're getting a head start it's

823
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:34,319
still not perfect there's still going to

824
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:36,000
be a lot of room for improvement and we

825
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:37,038
have a fight ahead for us

826
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,640
but

827
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:40,640
we're finally starting to think about it

828
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,640
the right way and think about like

829
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,000
not only do we give them licensing first

830
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,000
like how do we help them build

831
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,599
successful businesses that can compete

832
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,599
with the well-capitalized that can

833
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,278
compete with the companies that have

834
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:53,038
been around for decades and their

835
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:54,960
multi-state operators are you know

836
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:57,038
they're operating all over the globe we

837
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,200
want to make sure that there's room for

838
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:01,278
the mom and pop shops to be in the

839
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,880
market so i think

840
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:04,720
we need to continue to call that out i

841
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,960
think limited licensing

842
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,278
on every level is one of those problems

843
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,278
as well and quite frankly you're just

844
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:13,440
propping up the illicit market by

845
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:14,960
limiting on any level of that so i think

846
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,159
we need to continue to call that out

847
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,600
make sure that people are thinking

848
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,399
through that as a design policy

849
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:22,798
yeah

850
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:24,959
these are law school habits i think they

851
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:28,240
write stuff down um

852
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,159
but uh yeah you know and you know

853
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,599
again don't

854
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,840
countries like germany and the

855
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:34,879
regulators i hope that germans do their

856
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,798
own thing and

857
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,880
invent a market model and say hey you

858
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:40,398
know what colorado you guys screwed

859
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,840
things up you guys didn't give enough

860
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:43,839
people opportunity

861
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:46,480
you guys left the legacy market out you

862
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:48,720
guys left social equity out by not

863
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,919
allowing for free market capitalism to

864
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,880
triumph and for people to succeed or

865
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,720
fail based on their own merits access to

866
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,399
capital is a huge problem

867
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,399
and uh there's other groups that have

868
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:01,759
come up with this it's not my route well

869
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,519
i came up with it on my own but they

870
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,960
come up with that on their own as well

871
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,200
you know there's an easy way to solve

872
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,200
the social equity issue you know less

873
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,600
barriers to entry allow all the social

874
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,759
equity whoever wants to self-define as

875
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:16,558
social equity to participate and then

876
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:18,798
create funds with the taxes that are

877
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,960
generated so that they can have access

878
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:23,599
to capital to take out low interest like

879
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,840
loans from sba type programs if you want

880
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:27,439
to help social equity uh status

881
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:29,839
individuals and that's great that you

882
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,519
know i support that but to have people

883
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:32,959
go through a merit-based process to

884
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:35,440
determine that they're social equity

885
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,759
eligible that that's that's really tough

886
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,320
i guess you know even in a capital uh

887
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:41,839
even an event in a in a loan structure

888
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,480
they're going to have to do that but

889
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:45,759
again if i can say one thing

890
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,640
let's kill

891
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:50,480
limited licensing in cannabis

892
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,320
yeah it's diversity right isn't that

893
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,679
what you want in any ecosystem is

894
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:55,599
diversity

895
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,600
the um

896
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:59,519
yes and a couple of points that i wrote

897
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:00,719
a short little piece

898
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,880
for that

899
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,880
interesting little soft word the the

900
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,679
dominic's you know

901
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,720
saw here which i agree with

902
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,960
completely

903
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,919
um the other thing just talking about

904
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,200
advocacy and how to do it um

905
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:22,640
maybe because you know i we're we're

906
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,798
david to goliath you know but david won

907
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,399
you know and and i know we're winning i

908
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:28,000
know we're going to win this and and

909
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:29,678
it's going to be painful and there's

910
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
going to be a lot of baton passing i

911
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,640
mean i you know i've got you know my two

912
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,720
daughters are you know activists and i

913
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,720
i've got the baton handing over to them

914
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,720
and a lot of young people that i mentor

915
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,798
and bring along you know

916
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,038
there's a lot of organizing tips out

917
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:47,038
there you know we you know when we went

918
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:50,640
it up to humble you know the cannabis

919
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:52,640
farmers up there were terrified and we

920
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,640
actually brought them in and they were

921
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,320
going to the pta meetings and they

922
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,080
couldn't tell their teachers you know

923
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:00,639
what they did for a living the kids

924
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,720
teachers and we brought them in by

925
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,799
creating a stakeholder process you know

926
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,278
so we went and we started we went to the

927
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,798
rotary club and can we have a

928
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:11,119
can we have your monthly luncheon

929
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:13,119
meeting be about cannabis up here and

930
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:14,879
and you know business people in humboldt

931
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,759
county and it turned out

932
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:21,039
we had allies everywhere

933
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:22,640
we have allies in so many places but

934
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:25,038
they're afraid they're a little bit

935
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,519
afraid because of the stigma but when

936
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:29,759
you start to create a forum

937
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,399
or forum whatever the plural is you know

938
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:35,519
for people to come into a room and start

939
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:37,199
talking and communicating it's amazing

940
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,519
what happens and that's what happened up

941
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,519
in humble you know we had a 16-month

942
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:44,240
campaign that was kicked off at a rotary

943
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:47,359
club meeting in october of 2014 and by

944
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,440
january of 2016 which was really fast if

945
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:51,678
you talk to political people we had an

946
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,320
ordinance in place that was progressive

947
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,240
that had environmental concerns yes the

948
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:58,079
state screwed up they allowed stacking

949
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,359
the licenses and they wiped out you know

950
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,038
farmers and

951
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:02,639
not that the farmers knew what they were

952
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:04,798
doing how to get into the space or

953
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,200
branding and that's all other separate

954
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:09,519
conversation but the point is that you

955
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,278
can organize using stakeholder groups

956
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,839
you bring in the you know you bring

957
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:16,398
everybody into the room and you'll find

958
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:18,000
your allies they will emerge they're

959
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:20,398
they're in the political world they're

960
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,359
just afraid but you give them a place to

961
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:26,000
speak as an organizing tool that that's

962
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:27,918
really powerful you know create places

963
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
that you wouldn't think to go

964
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,320
the rotary club the

965
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,599
you know the the whatever it is you know

966
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:35,200
they're out there there's all these

967
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,278
places and they're all

968
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,399
interested in cannabis we all have

969
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:40,480
veterans

970
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:42,798
every country has veterans of war and

971
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,919
all of them have ptsd and physical pain

972
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:46,079
and almost all of them are being

973
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,840
prescribed opiates right now so that's

974
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:49,359
one thing also just like as we're

975
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:50,798
diversifying our voices one thing i've

976
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:52,959
noticed is the only people advocating

977
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:54,639
for cannabis is usually business people

978
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,720
if i was a legislator and i saw business

979
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,000
people coming to advocate for cannabis i

980
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,839
would not trust them i would think that

981
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,519
they were just doing it to do business

982
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:03,278
unfortunately we've seen in california

983
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,519
is that the patients don't come out and

984
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:06,798
lobby with us when we go to the city

985
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,719
council meetings until one in the

986
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:10,719
morning on a tuesday night in the middle

987
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,480
of the night it's all business people

988
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,598
it's not convincing and i think that

989
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,599
that's something we need to really think

990
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,960
about is with these stakeholder meetings

991
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,320
how many business people in here have

992
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,079
actually held the stakeholder meetings

993
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,399
beyond maybe a focus group for early

994
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,679
stage branding market research like

995
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:25,118
who's really getting people together

996
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,800
first thing we're all fighting for these

997
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,960
people where where are these people are

998
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,800
they at the old folks home like in

999
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,519
berkeley you know or in the bay area we

1000
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,919
had sue taylor who's bringing it into um

1001
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:37,838
uh old folks homes and it was they were

1002
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,598
able to get topical rubs with cannabis i

1003
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:41,759
mean these are things that had to go

1004
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,280
into the community um you know talking

1005
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,040
to school teachers how are we doing this

1006
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,560
work i mean really ask yourself like how

1007
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,719
are you really talking to the end

1008
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:50,878
consumer and having them talk back to

1009
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,638
the legislators we cannot do it alone

1010
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:54,480
there's way too few of us we're in the

1011
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,159
minority the majority of people are

1012
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,240
either neutral or uncomfortable around

1013
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,440
cannabis um other business people we're

1014
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:01,118
all busy right i don't know about you

1015
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,880
guys but i've been working 90 hour weeks

1016
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,119
for the last two years without a break

1017
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,039
just with ice fire before that it's like

1018
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,519
six seven years in the cannabis industry

1019
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:11,119
with no breaks this is a crisis where

1020
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:12,559
this is not a game to us like there are

1021
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,640
people dying every day there are people

1022
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:16,639
rotting in jail who are a lot darker

1023
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,159
skin than me for doing a lot less than

1024
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:20,799
what i do every day and get applauded

1025
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,879
for so this is like we don't have time

1026
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,240
we don't have many resources but we have

1027
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,559
the love and the organizing and the

1028
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,559
networking and leaning into that and

1029
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:30,799
that diversity i mean they say this with

1030
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:32,799
women too it's like having more people

1031
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,960
in the business is not just a feel-good

1032
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,440
move you actually objectively in the

1033
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,920
data have better innovation more

1034
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,960
disruptive technology um and even same

1035
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,400
thing with like women and people of

1036
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,159
color in the workspace it's not just you

1037
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,160
can feel good that there's chicks on

1038
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:48,639
your team women people of color provide

1039
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:50,159
incredible insights that build out the

1040
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:51,759
end result for your consumer and you

1041
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:53,279
sell better love is lucrative that's

1042
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,200
what we have to remember the love is

1043
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,040
lucrative but how are we gonna actually

1044
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,879
organizing it together to your point

1045
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:00,880
stakeholders are rarely in the room with

1046
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,680
us we have a lot of these conversations

1047
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,358
in these kind of silos and it's an echo

1048
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:07,358
chamber so you know i really invite you

1049
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:09,440
guys to talk to the soccer moms go to

1050
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:11,838
the places where they're focused on wine

1051
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,280
and cocaine at the club when i'm out

1052
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:15,199
there when i'm out in the back dabbing

1053
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,800
and everyone's railing lines and start a

1054
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:18,799
conversation be like this is what i do

1055
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,640
this is my plant medicine this is how i

1056
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,920
integrate it i talk about the cannabis

1057
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:24,078
industry the people who are not in the

1058
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,480
industry all the time because the best

1059
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,480
way to stop the war on drugs from making

1060
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,880
more veterans of the war on drugs is to

1061
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,719
stop making the laws that criminalize it

1062
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,960
and every person who's a voting person

1063
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:37,199
has a voice in that so just like he said

1064
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,358
this is not about industry this is a

1065
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:42,319
movement a mass movement for medical

1066
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:46,000
freedom and go through the world talking

1067
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,599
like you are a a conduit of this social

1068
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,639
and physical and emotional change that

1069
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,200
we're all going through and you should

1070
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:53,118
be very very very proud of what you do

1071
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:55,199
and be very forward about what you do

1072
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,960
i'm a public school teacher you know i

1073
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:58,639
still have my credential in english in

1074
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,838
california i could go back and teach at

1075
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:03,199
any time i made a choice to openly be in

1076
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:04,960
cannabis and i'm proud when former

1077
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:07,199
students reach out to me they're always

1078
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,199
stoked to see what i'm doing my parents

1079
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:10,239
are proud of me it is you know it

1080
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:11,838
doesn't make sense for someone with a

1081
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:13,919
master's in teaching to be slinging me

1082
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:15,920
at an international level maybe not on

1083
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,920
paper but the change that i'm making in

1084
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,519
my life and the amount of times that

1085
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,519
i've been scared to move forward in this

1086
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:23,199
space and the universe has shown me that

1087
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:24,960
this is the right path and just we're

1088
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:27,759
just here to show you that we've been

1089
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,358
through a decade of absolute hell it's

1090
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,200
like being in an abusive relationship

1091
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:32,400
with someone you know that this industry

1092
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:33,598
is only going to keep harming when you

1093
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,680
show up every day loving it

1094
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,519
unconditionally if we can do it you guys

1095
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:39,279
can absolutely do it and we are totally

1096
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:41,440
here for you every step of the way as

1097
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,960
you guys roll this out all of our pain

1098
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,920
all of our suffering that we've gone

1099
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,039
through you're not gonna have to go

1100
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,869
through it again if we have anything to

1101
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:54,179
do with it

1102
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:54,179
[Applause]

1103
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:03,280
there's a ton of examples as to why

1104
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:06,000
limited licensing is a failure and while

1105
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,400
extensive licensing is a success anyone

1106
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,559
who ever says the oklahoma industry

1107
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,559
sucks that's just somebody who couldn't

1108
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:14,400
compete and couldn't win and who

1109
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:17,039
expected too much and wanted to keep

1110
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,800
prices of cannabis too high but if i may

1111
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:21,759
say one thing because we are in germany

1112
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,079
and i am reminded that in 1945

1113
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,480
the piece was made and they thought it

1114
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,000
was a good idea to divide up you know

1115
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,920
into four actually more than four

1116
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,838
sections like five six seven but

1117
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,440
famously four sections united states

1118
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:37,920
france et cetera and it took until 1991

1119
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,760
to unify and get that right

1120
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,079
uh and let the people of germany come

1121
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,680
together as one maybe they had to be

1122
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,240
taught a lesson i don't know

1123
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:49,199
but but we know that germany is a great

1124
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:51,598
una united country uh now and think

1125
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,039
about that 45 years so again if i can

1126
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,880
leave you with one thing

1127
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,759
i was listening to how the stakeholders

1128
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,280
meetings were happening the

1129
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,839
parliamentarians last the summer and

1130
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,920
that work has happened already here

1131
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:06,000
and uh one of the individuals was

1132
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,960
telling me that there was not one

1133
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,119
person

1134
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,358
who was advocating for prohibition

1135
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,640
that's great so we don't need to talk

1136
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:17,159
about that anymore we need to talk about

1137
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,879
let's kill limited

1138
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:22,480
licensing

1139
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,880
let's talk about that because it's about

1140
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:29,199
the market structure and you do not want

1141
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,559
to wait 45 years to get that right the

1142
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:32,399
next time

1143
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:34,799
yeah and i think that's really important

1144
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,039
is you know we we've been talking about

1145
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,200
talking um but the other really

1146
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:40,960
important piece is listening and knowing

1147
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:43,358
when to change your message because a

1148
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,760
lot of the early success i had as i was

1149
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:48,078
coming into these meetings where

1150
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,000
medical cannabis advocates would be

1151
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,079
expounding all the benefits of medical

1152
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,239
cannabis to a city council

1153
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,240
who doesn't really whether he believes

1154
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:57,919
you or not it doesn't matter that's not

1155
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:59,919
part of his job that's not something

1156
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,680
that's going to get him somewhere once

1157
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,200
you kind of show them hey look this is

1158
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:05,358
what happened in all these cities in

1159
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:07,439
california and these guys regulated

1160
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:08,960
early and they've got no problems and

1161
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,318
they're you know improving their

1162
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,000
industry all the time and these guys

1163
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:14,000
tried to fight it and got hit with 10

1164
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
000 lawsuits and you know and then as

1165
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,838
soon as they see something like that you

1166
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,440
know that triggers somewhere so it's

1167
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:21,440
like important it's important to know

1168
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,960
your audience and the message and

1169
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,880
speaking of which

1170
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:28,079
are there any questions

1171
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,390
in the audience hasn't gone over here

1172
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:33,449
let's hear it from the panel yeah

1173
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:33,449
[Applause]

1174
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,160
lots more questions this year

1175
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:43,838
uh i think this question is maybe

1176
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,599
primarily for dimitri but maybe for the

1177
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:47,920
whole panel um what do you think of

1178
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,240
what's going on in new mexico uh your

1179
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,240
your your neighbor which has seemingly

1180
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:53,598
adopted the opposite of a limited

1181
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:55,519
licensing framework you mentioned

1182
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,280
oklahoma but just curious about new

1183
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:00,239
mexico and other models what they've

1184
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,519
done right and what they can do better

1185
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:02,799
well you know

1186
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:04,480
let me give you an example i think it's

1187
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,000
great for simple questions great

1188
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,000
anything that's better than anything

1189
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,199
that was away from limited licensing and

1190
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,719
more opportunity is better than not but

1191
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:15,039
let me give you an example in arizona

1192
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:17,039
what we have going on right now

1193
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:20,480
we have brands that are migrating into

1194
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:21,838
these intrastate models and right now we

1195
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,880
have all these brands coming in from

1196
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:27,440
oklahoma that have successfully competed

1197
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,240
and worn against 300 other

1198
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:33,119
gummy lines and the businessmen know

1199
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:35,039
that these brands have shown some sort

1200
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:39,358
of success with the consumers and

1201
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:42,079
patients that is desirable so they are

1202
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:46,000
uh more likely to take them in than a

1203
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:48,560
brand from arizona who doesn't you know

1204
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,639
just as competing against 25 other gummy

1205
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:52,480
lines so anywhere there's better more

1206
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:54,000
competition you're going to find a

1207
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,920
better marketplace this is simple

1208
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,679
economics it's just something that we've

1209
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,200
adopted and it's been replicated over

1210
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:00,719
and over again because people like what

1211
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:02,239
are they doing colorado what are they

1212
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:03,279
doing colorado what are they doing and

1213
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:04,159
then they keep

1214
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,400
up

1215
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:08,719
so we need to stop this

1216
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,880
domino effect at some point and

1217
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:13,199
somebody's gonna get it right if i was

1218
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,720
the german chancellor in charge of is

1219
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:16,559
there a chancellor yeah if i was in

1220
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:19,679
charge of germany i would say we want to

1221
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:22,400
be the best we want competition we want

1222
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:24,719
innovation we want to be known globally

1223
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,639
as the best cannabis manufacturers so

1224
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:27,919
cultivators i know it's northern europe

1225
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:30,400
so a little different but at least

1226
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,960
manufacturers product producers anywhere

1227
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,039
we're going to create a free market and

1228
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,800
we're going to teach the americans what

1229
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:38,159
a free market is because you guys didn't

1230
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,400
get it right over there in the united

1231
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:42,879
states but we are going to get it right

1232
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,639
so i like new mexico if you want to

1233
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,480
can i just add to that one of the things

1234
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:47,679
that i think new mexico did really well

1235
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,039
while they were drafting their

1236
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,399
legislation

1237
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:53,199
is they

1238
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,000
did a thorough scan of what not to do

1239
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:58,000
and see they literally we had multiple

1240
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,159
conversations with the legislative

1241
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,159
members or drafting law

1242
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:04,239
and they knew that we had a lot of data

1243
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:06,000
around the industry and they just we

1244
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:07,838
would set up these working sessions for

1245
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,838
hours and they would ask us for data we

1246
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:11,759
would dig it up we would find it we

1247
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:13,599
would pull pieces of law that we thought

1248
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,240
okay new jersey got this section right

1249
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,318
we got this right in washington

1250
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:19,759
they did they looked at everything and

1251
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:20,880
then tried to do the best that they

1252
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,560
could

1253
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:26,800
um to start it out they also have since

1254
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:28,318
legalizing have realized they made some

1255
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,720
mistakes and they're already going back

1256
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:32,719
to fix it next january so i think

1257
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:34,879
they've gone in eyes wide open and we're

1258
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:37,679
really open to hearing what worked and

1259
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,440
hasn't worked across the united states

1260
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:41,440
smart

1261
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,159
and just the idea that

1262
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,000
talk to the legislators let's go go call

1263
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:47,358
them up they have staff people they're

1264
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,519
good yes

1265
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:52,239
they listen they really listen when you

1266
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:53,920
toe up their offices they have meetings

1267
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:55,358
about you cannabis people being loud is

1268
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,200
the only reason you even know the word

1269
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:59,279
california and bring them on a medical

1270
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:01,519
cancer patient i mean you know i hate to

1271
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,040
be cynical sounding but i mean every

1272
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:05,440
time we did a lawsuit on behalf of

1273
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:07,119
medical cannabis patients we put her and

1274
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,519
we got someone in a wheelchair we put

1275
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,680
people up right in front right in front

1276
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:13,920
and made sure that the community and

1277
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:15,919
that everybody saw what was going on

1278
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,000
that this was about access for people

1279
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,079
who needed to use cannabis for whatever

1280
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,119
reason but we gave them some really

1281
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,800
compelling reasons there's some nuances

1282
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,720
that are really wrong as bridget was

1283
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,318
saying with with new mexico but in

1284
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:29,919
general heading in that direction is a

1285
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:31,759
great idea

1286
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,519
so it's not perfect

1287
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,359
hi right up here

1288
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:37,039
hey great conversation here in berlin so

1289
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:39,039
great to be back

1290
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:41,119
and it's very lucky to for the germans

1291
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,559
to hear these insights because

1292
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,760
it's all very similar to what they're

1293
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:45,440
going to be going through so we didn't

1294
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,040
have that when we started but i wanted

1295
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,519
to talk about education because i think

1296
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:51,199
a lot of the things that could be solved

1297
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:52,960
because we did education much later

1298
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:54,399
jamie knows uh we did a bunch of

1299
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,599
education together

1300
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,200
would it be nice if everyone just

1301
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,039
consolidated education and i don't know

1302
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:01,118
if anyone has any thoughts on is there a

1303
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:03,920
way that we can just help educate work

1304
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:05,358
together to make one bible of education

1305
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,599
to share around the world which will

1306
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:09,358
make all of our jobs easier uh any

1307
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:13,280
thoughts on that

1308
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:13,279
i'm gonna do a shameless plug right now

1309
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:19,039
wmpolicy.com we've been gathering data

1310
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:21,118
we have papers from different thought

1311
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:22,639
leaders we have we have a bunch of

1312
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,720
policy papers

1313
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:26,639
um and you can also put in requests

1314
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:28,239
where we are pulling as much as we can

1315
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:30,559
from the industry making sure that we

1316
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:32,159
have best practices there check it out

1317
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:33,920
but this is something that has been a

1318
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:36,078
labor of love for the last five years

1319
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,920
and i think we have done a good job of

1320
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,190
gathering a lot of the information of

1321
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,240
lessons learned

1322
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:42,800

1324
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,640
weed match wm for weed masks

1325
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,838
we're also seeing

1326
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:51,440
you know actually when you talk about

1327
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:53,599
education we're actually seeing some of

1328
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,679
the community colleges and colleges and

1329
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:57,599
law schools actually having curriculum

1330
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:59,519
now and well where they really need

1331
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,240
curriculum is in the medical schools

1332
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:03,679
because you know they did surveys and

1333
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:05,519
medical students aren't taught about the

1334
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:07,440
endocannabinoid system so you know

1335
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:09,599
there's there's a lot of work that needs

1336
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,599
to be done but there's curriculum people

1337
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,160
developing curriculum for actually you

1338
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:17,440
know for higher education um they won't

1339
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:18,879
they won't let us get into the

1340
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,960
the grammar schools and the elementary

1341
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,960
schools and the high schools but we can

1342
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,599
go into the community colleges and law

1343
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,240
schools and universities and and that i

1344
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:30,559
think is you know again it's it's a long

1345
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:32,879
process yeah and i think this is a it's

1346
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:34,880
a piecemeal approach that alex is trying

1347
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,160
to avoid because you know in canada you

1348
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,358
know so i taught one of the first

1349
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:41,440
courses um at a university level one on

1350
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:42,880
dispensaries but then there was you know

1351
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,480
multiple other ones that were written

1352
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,880
and the laws were being changed at the

1353
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,119
time and there was no no uniform

1354
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:52,240
approach um and and you know we've seen

1355
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:54,000
it particularly affect our pharmacies um

1356
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:55,919
you know pharmacies were asked if they

1357
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,679
wanted to be part of the medical program

1358
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,519
before legalization and none of them

1359
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:01,118
wanted to touch it and then after

1360
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:02,719
recreational legalization all the

1361
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,160
pharmacies wanted to jump on board and

1362
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:06,719
started saying we're the only ones that

1363
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:08,639
should be prescribing it but they still

1364
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:10,480
didn't bother to teach anybody about the

1365
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:13,358
endocannabinoid system and you know the

1366
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,920
pharmacological colleges were still like

1367
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:17,039
no you know doctors colleges that don't

1368
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,358
want to hear it and they're still

1369
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:22,838
anti-cannabis which is

1370
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:25,279
mind-boggling but here we are in 2022

1371
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:27,279
right here we are

1372
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,040
just one one thing i would want to say

1373
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,480
did anybody else know that you look

1374
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:33,358
closely at those lights they're green

1375
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,920
and red yes yeah i tried that too very

1376
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:38,960
tricky that is awesome i thought i

1377
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,960
thought i was like

1378
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:54,649
one more time

1379
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:54,650
