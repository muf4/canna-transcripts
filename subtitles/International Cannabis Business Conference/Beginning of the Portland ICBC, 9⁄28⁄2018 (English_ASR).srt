1
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,958
how's everyone feeling y'all feeling

2
00:00:10,048 --> 00:00:15,298
good this morning whoo so I'm talking

3
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:17,429
about Mike we're really happy to have

4
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:19,829
everyone here today in Portland we are

5
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:23,219
the ICBC we do our conference all over

6
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:26,278
the world we are the first b2b to go

7
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:31,049
international and we started in Portland

8
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:32,909
four years ago it was I remember me and

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,929
Anthony talking and I said we said what

10
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:35,429
are we gonna do and we said we're gonna

11
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:36,689
start the international cannabis

12
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:40,229
business conference says we're ever

13
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:41,998
gonna start was at Portland and so for a

14
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:43,858
few years we weren't international we

15
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:45,899
were just in Portland in San Francisco

16
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:47,999
and then eventually we became

17
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,129
international we went to Vancouver if

18
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:52,050
that counts

19
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:53,908
kind of like international a half right

20
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:56,518
Canada you're still in Cascadia right

21
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:59,850
and so we went and we then we then we

22
00:00:56,518 --> 00:01:03,119
went to bars for Lynn and we rocked it

23
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,969
we turned it out and of course our event

24
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,920
in California is the longest-running in

25
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:11,760
California and now we've partnered with

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,920
spannabis to be in Barcelona also next

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,680
year so we're really thank you we're

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,810
really excited about what we're doing

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,680
what we have done in Oregon and what we

30
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,240
are doing worldwide so I like to think

31
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,910
that wherever we go in the world

32
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,519
we bring a little piece of Oregon with

33
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,599
us and it's really important because

34
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,189
when you go to Europe and they're

35
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:33,689
growing all that shitty weed and they

36
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,719
just want to make money money money and

37
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:39,329
you're like hey maybe you could you know

38
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,349
go organic or you know maybe there's a

39
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:41,700
product you know you

40
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:43,589
we can bring a little that Oregon

41
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,510
consciousness to the world and I'm not

42
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,310
saying we're like all Mother Teresa's

43
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,840
here in Oregon but when you do leave

44
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,519
Oregon and you talk to people and you

45
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,250
talk like in Europe and you talk about

46
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:54,629
some hippie like activism should they

47
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,519
look at you like you're an alien like

48
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:57,839
what are you talking about but it's

49
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,189
really important that we push that

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,390
narrative and what I tell people in

51
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:05,340
Berlin Haley Anthony Haley

52
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,840
Anthony please thank you appreciate it

53
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:12,060
what I tell people in you know Berlin

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,009
the first thing I say to them is your

55
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,300
beer as it's this nascent new market

56
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,199
over there it's really crazy what's

57
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,230
going on in Europe

58
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:21,209
I say hey you're bureaucrats and

59
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:22,019
politicians are going to [ __ ] [ __ ] up so

60
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,599
what's important

61
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,159
is that you have a robust home garden

62
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,199
and all criminal penalties are ended

63
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,329
towards cannabis and I think it's really

64
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:32,549
important because the industry will get

65
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:35,250
messed up in Oregon smaller people have

66
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:38,550
been pushed out you know for better or

67
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:42,300
mostly for worse and this is not what we

68
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:44,550
ascribe to at the ICBC we think cannabis

69
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,110
is an opportunity for the world not only

70
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,330
for business not only from human rights

71
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,880
or civil rights but we think it can help

72
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,320
end the industrial some of the

73
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,509
industrial complexes in the world and

74
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,489
just like my mentor Jack hare said hemp

75
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:59,189
can save the world and we believe it you

76
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,840
know I thank you thank you we used to

77
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:02,340
say it on Haight Ashbury you know back

78
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,810
in the day with my dreadlocks I used to

79
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,400
have my signs and hemp can save the

80
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,890
world and I barely believed it myself

81
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,240
you know but it's true hemp can save the

82
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:10,889
world and when we don't have a lot of

83
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,080
hopeful [ __ ] going on in this world

84
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:15,179

heartfelt thanks to everyone never say

117

never but we do not plan to do another

118
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:30,800
Oregon show for some years now and this

119
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,389
is our 12th show in Oregon in four years

120
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,800
you know like I said we're not gonna be

121
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:35,439
an Oregon anymore but everything we do

122
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,069
and how we

123
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,300
fourth we represent we represent Oregon

124
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:42,459
so what we're trying to do is create

125
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,629
conduits so when we can finally export

126
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:45,189
cannabis

127
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:47,379
I'll have created all these awesome

128
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:52,000
conduits around the world so we can sell

129
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:54,579
all our Oregon weed to the world it's

130
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,870
only a matter of time - it's only a

131
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:57,370
matter of time and that's really gonna

132
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,540
change the game up and we're actually

133
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,980
gonna be talking about that we got a

134
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,170
great program but that will be delving

135
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,390
into a lot of that how organ can export

136
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:06,759
in some of the pasta possibilities um

137
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:09,219

you today we have a lot of amazing

154
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:48,660
people I'd like to kick it off really

155
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:53,800
quick with a person who's gonna

156
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:56,260
introduce our opening video he is a hero

157
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,270
of Oregon like I just told him a second

158
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:00,430
ago I hate most politicians and I love

159
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:02,589
you what is going on here you know what

160
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,030
I mean because most politicians are it's

161
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:05,679
hard to be a politician because the game

162
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:08,979
is rigged right but guess what on a

163
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,959
local level we do have a few folks that

164
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,970
are conscious mock consciously minded

165
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,500
and revolutionary thinking and who

166
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,230
actually have some power and can get

167
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,839
things done and our one big ally in this

168
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:21,610
state is Senator Floyd presents key so

169
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,529
without further ado please make some

170
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,408
noise for our beloved Senator Floyd

171
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:27,848
who's asking

172
00:06:25,408 --> 00:06:36,370
you know make some more noise for Floyd

173
00:06:27,848 --> 00:06:38,079
y'all so I want to thank all of you that

174
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,240
are here today I also want to thank Alex

175
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,060
for bringing forward this conference

176
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,918
he's been a trendsetter for the state

177
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,019
and as well as he said on an

178
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:49,779
international level without this type of

179
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:52,418
discourse we would not be able to move

180
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:54,938
forward as we need to thin this industry

181
00:06:52,418 --> 00:06:56,438
it's been my opportunity to at this

182
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:59,349
point really to just take a few moments

183
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:02,139
to introduce Jeff Merkley before we hear

184
00:06:59,348 --> 00:07:05,199
from all in his video what I first met

185
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:07,418
Jeff back in 1999 that is the year that

186
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,689
he came into office as a state

187
00:07:07,418 --> 00:07:13,029
representative representing part of

188
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:16,959
Portland on the east side at that point

189
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:20,019
I got to I guess get to know who he was

190
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:22,180
in 2003 four years later we had our

191
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:23,799
offices next to each other this allowed

192
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,569
us to spend a lot of time talking

193
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,939
together not only on the issues that

194
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:29,468
were facing the state but after hours

195
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:31,240
just sitting around anew selecting on

196
00:07:29,468 --> 00:07:34,240
where we were what we wanted what were

197
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,038
our values how could we move or go nians

198
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,569
forward how could we take care of many

199
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:40,079
of the issues that we're facing us

200
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:44,588
including the economic depression and

201
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:48,490
uncertainty in many rural areas he comes

202
00:07:44,588 --> 00:07:50,019
from a background of a rural area Merle

203
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,468
Creek for those who do not know is in

204
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:56,978
Southern Oregon he his father was in the

205
00:07:53,468 --> 00:07:59,110
trades as a laborer and they moved up to

206
00:07:56,978 --> 00:08:01,389
here in the Portland area and where he

207
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,908
finished his high school it was one of

208
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:05,588
those situations that when we were

209
00:08:02,908 --> 00:08:09,250
sitting around and talking I always

210
00:08:05,588 --> 00:08:10,930
found myself just being drawn in by his

211
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,728
thoughts his visions of what he would

212
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:15,218
solved for the state and how he thought

213
00:08:12,728 --> 00:08:17,918
we needed to move forward this is one of

214
00:08:15,218 --> 00:08:20,379
those situations that I remember when he

215
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,568
decided to run for the US Senate Senate

216
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:25,509
I was actually traveling back from

217
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:27,158
Byrnes so I was on highway US 20 and I

218
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:28,838
got this phone call from Jeff and Jeff

219
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:32,259
says hey Floyd what do you think about

220
00:08:28,838 --> 00:08:34,629
me running for US Senate and I just kind

221
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:36,788
of did a little bit on my drive there

222
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:39,009
going wow that's a pretty big step

223
00:08:36,788 --> 00:08:41,289
you're thinking about he had just been

224
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:44,379
elected and served as the Speaker of the

225
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:47,079
House he had been the Democratic leader

226
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:48,610
prior to that and so I know that he was

227
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,590
getting his message out in people who

228
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,480
are listening so I told him I said if

229
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,790
you really feel that you have the

230
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,610
ability to move forward at this time in

231
00:08:54,789 --> 00:08:59,949
your career to run for that seat I will

232
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,710
support you and he didn't won't go

233
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,690
forward and as we all know he won the

234
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:07,389
Democratic primary that allowed him to

235
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:10,660
go up against the incumbent Gordon Smith

236
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:13,240
and it was a very close race but Jeff

237
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:16,149
seceded and he's been in the USN since

238
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,860
2009 what's really important is seeing

239
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:19,809
how he's taking his visions for this

240
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,779
state and has taken them and moved them

241
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:24,729
into a much larger larger broader area

242
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:26,169
for the country and it's one of those

243
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,590
situations that I've been very impressed

244
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:31,959
to see how he's not been afraid to take

245
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:33,580
very controversial issues and put them

246
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,550
out on the table for us to talk about

247
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:39,190
and for others to listen this is one of

248
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:41,649
those situations that he was the only

249
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:47,830
senator to actually endorsed Bernie

250
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:50,559
Sanders for the primary in the 2016 and

251
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:52,600
you can only imagine being a senator to

252
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:55,149
take that type of step at that point in

253
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,860
his career what he was demarcating that

254
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:58,449
Heath was going for who he thought was

255
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,789
going to be the best individual to

256
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:05,470
represent the Democrats and the national

257
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:07,899
election after that he earlier in that

258
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,700
year he he attempted I should say

259
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:12,069
earlier this year he's attempted to

260
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,259
enter into one of the immigration

261
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,450
detention centers this is down in South

262
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:18,610
Texas for those who have not met me

263
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,950
that's my birthday and when I heard that

264
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,139
Jeff went down to the Harlingen area

265
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:26,140
what he was attempting to do was to see

266
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:28,659
how children of parents who had been

267
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:31,629
arrested trying to come in to the u.s.

268
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:33,519
seeking asylum were being handled and

269
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:35,439
how they were being taken care of well

270
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,990
ironically they were place they had

271
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,380
placed them into a detention in a former

272
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:43,870
Walmart and he was denied access as a

273
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:46,179
u.s. senator to go in to check on the

274
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:49,389
welfare of these children of course this

275
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:51,679
made big news throughout not only the

276
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:53,629
nation but also internationally

277
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:56,149
and it just showed once again where Jeff

278
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:59,659
was willing to take that step to bring

279
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:02,179
and expose the the needs of individuals

280
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:05,058
that are more disparate than he is and

281
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:06,378
how he could in fact bring and shed the

282
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:09,409
light to make certain that they are

283
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:12,319
being taken care of besides that we have

284
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:13,999
seen even this week where Jeff has

285
00:11:12,318 --> 00:11:16,990
actually was seeking an injunction to

286
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:20,420
stop the confirmation of Brent Cavanaugh

287
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:23,028
because as he says how can he as a u.s.

288
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:25,248
senator be able to vote on the floor for

289
00:11:23,028 --> 00:11:26,808
a nominee without having all of the

290
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:29,360
allegations that have been raised

291
00:11:26,808 --> 00:11:31,458
against him being invested investigated

292
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,649
through the FBI and then being able to

293
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:35,539
have all of that out in the open be

294
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:37,879
transparent and then make the decision

295
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:41,838
as to whether or not that justice should

296
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:47,119
be elevated to the Supreme Court so at

297
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:49,699
this point I think it's worth noting

298
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:52,339
before we hear from Jeff that in May of

299
00:11:49,698 --> 00:11:56,808
this year he came forward to co-sponsor

300
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:59,689
senator Corey Brooks brokers marijuana

301
00:11:56,808 --> 00:12:01,159
justice Act this would remove marijuana

302
00:11:59,688 --> 00:12:03,649
from the federal list of controlled

303
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:05,419
substances ie making it legal throughout

304
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:08,419
the country and I think it's really

305
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:10,248
important for us to see again where Jeff

306
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:13,338
has been willing to take that step to

307
00:12:10,249 --> 00:12:15,139
move forward to get us as a nation to

308
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:19,100
deal with issues that we should have

309
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:21,769
dealt with back in 1971 1972 so with

310
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:24,409
that let me just end with that he has

311
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:26,509
not only just been a co-sponsor of the

312
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:31,399
legislation I just mentioned but he's

313
00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:33,620
also been active and trying to get the

314
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:37,659
reform in the banking as we all know we

315
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:39,709
need to open up the banking both through

316
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:41,870
financial institutions that include

317
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:43,578
banks as well as credit unions so we

318
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,948
can't in fact have the accountability as

319
00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:48,678
a legislator I'm very concerned that

320
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:50,419
we're not helping and facilitate so we

321
00:12:48,678 --> 00:12:52,698
can in fact make certain that there's

322
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:55,128
accountability and the reality there's a

323
00:12:52,698 --> 00:12:56,599
safety risk here but as many of you that

324
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:58,730
are in the business to have that type of

325
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,159
cash sitting around and not being able

326
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,680
to actually do what most businesses do

327
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:04,709
that

328
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,719
is a financial institution is wrong so

329
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,830
he's taken little eat there and I think

330
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,620
it's very important that we also

331
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:13,410
acknowledge that he is also saying that

332
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:16,230
VA doctors should in fact have the

333
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:18,088
ability to actually give counseling to

334
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,450
vets in states that actually have

335
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:25,339
medical programs as to the benefit of

336
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:25,339
medical marijuana for those individuals

337
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,839
so I hope that gives you a little bit of

338
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:35,309
flavor of who Jeff Merkley is and I at

339
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,980
this point want us to have an

340
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:39,299
opportunity to see where he's heading

341
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,519
and what he wants to do for this

342
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:45,289
industry and so we'll have a few words

343
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,289
from Jeff by video thank you

344
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:52,058
[Applause]

345
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,690
[Music]

346
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:44,519
greetings I'm Senator Jeff Merkley and

347
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:47,039
welcome to the International cannabis

348
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,929
business conference in state after state

349
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,669
the American people have stood up to say

350
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:51,838
that it's time to change cannabis laws

351
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:54,838
in America

352
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,880
that's why four years ago I was proud as

353
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:58,890
an Oregonian to support major ninety-one

354
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,838
and become the first United States

355
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:03,659
senator to vote for legalizing cannabis

356
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,399
in my home state now I'm working with my

357
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:06,919
colleagues in Washington to help make

358
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,028
these changes at the national level

359
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:10,860
because here's what we know about the

360
00:16:09,028 --> 00:16:13,549
impact of legalizing cannabis from the

361
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:17,430
states that have done it more jobs more

362
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:19,109
tax revenues fewer arrests and a second

363
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:20,819
chance for individuals convicted of

364
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:23,519
minor drug offenses who have had their

365
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,649
records expunged just look at the effect

366
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,179
right here in Oregon the fiscal impact

367
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:28,649
committee originally predicted that

368
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:30,120
legalizing cannabis would generate

369
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:32,339
between seventeen and forty million

370
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,560
dollars a year for the state but the

371
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:36,690
state is on track to double the higher

372
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,569
end of that projection and bring in more

373
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:40,800
than eighty million dollars a year

374
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,730
forty percent of that revenue goes right

375
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,799
back into our schools

376
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:46,289
that's roughly thirty four million

377
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:47,549
dollars for our students and teachers 20

378
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:51,088
percent goes in in mental health

379
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:53,549
alcoholism and drug services another 12

380
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:55,350
to 13 million for the state police and

381
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:59,009
over 4 million for the Oregon Health

382
00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:01,230
Authority and Oregon isn't alone the

383
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:03,929
same kinds of benefits can be seen in

384
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:06,599
Colorado and in Washington State and in

385
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:09,750
Nevada all of which have seen actual

386
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:12,389
revenue beat the initial estimates the

387
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:14,130
time has come for us to change the way

388
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:16,740
our country looks at and deals with

389
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:19,679
cannabis and I'm working in Washington

390
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,449
to make that happen I've introduced the

391
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,548
safe banking act to ensure that

392
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:25,740
legitimate businesses following state

393
00:17:23,548 --> 00:17:28,379
cannabis laws have the same access to

394
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:32,160
resources and services that every other

395
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:34,110
business has not too long ago I went and

396
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,360
saw for myself our business owners cut

397
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:37,529
off from services and opportunities have

398
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:40,409
to pay taxes

399
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:42,899
stuffing backpacks and duffle bags full

400
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:46,048
of cash and driving hours to Salem to

401
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:48,809
deposit it there is no reason that if a

402
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:50,369
state has voted to legalize business

403
00:17:48,808 --> 00:17:52,349
owners should have to operate in this

404
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:55,288
way it's burnham sin'

405
00:17:52,349 --> 00:17:58,699
and it's dangerous billions of dollars

406
00:17:55,288 --> 00:18:01,169
in cash is great for organized crime

407
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:04,409
it's great for money laundering it's

408
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:07,019
great for cheating on wages and taxes so

409
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:10,409
we would all benefit by banking the

410
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:13,319
cannabis economy we also need to make

411
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:14,909
sure that hemp products with low THC are

412
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:17,129
not regulated under the Controlled

413
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:19,080
Substances Act and I'm proud that this

414
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:22,590
change has been included in the Senate

415
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:24,000
farm bill this year while we still need

416
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:27,269
to get the farm bill over the finish

417
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,190
line getting rid of this illogical

418
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:30,808
restriction will help create jobs and

419
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:34,320
strengthen the agricultural sector

420
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:35,668
across the United States in addition I'm

421
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,500
working with senator Booker on the

422
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:39,409
marijuana Justice Act to decriminalize

423
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,909
cannabis stop racially disproportionate

424
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:43,289
enforcement of cannabis crimes and give

425
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:45,899
those convicted of past use of

426
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:47,339
possession crimes a clean slate and I'm

427
00:18:45,898 --> 00:18:49,079
a co-sponsor of senator Schumer's

428
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:50,609
marijuana freedom Opportunity Act which

429
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:54,538
would also be criminalized cannabis

430
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:58,019
throughout the nation times are changing

431
00:18:54,538 --> 00:19:00,419
the American people are demanding change

432
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:02,878
to how we treat cannabis across our

433
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:04,769
nation they know the benefits that

434
00:19:02,878 --> 00:19:07,278
legalizing cannabis brings socially

435
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:10,138
economically and in our justice system

436
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:12,388
and I'm determined to help bring about

437
00:19:10,138 --> 00:19:14,788
those changes and I'm thrilled to be

438
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:17,508
working in partnership with all of you

439
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:17,509
to do it

440
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:34,029
let's give a big thanks to Jared our

441
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:37,000
signer here today thank you brother

442
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:39,069
one more big thing for Senator Merkley

443
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,930
and let's make some noise and hope that

444
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:43,500
he runs for president because I know I'd

445
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,500
vote for him

446
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:51,820
so at the ICBC we like to bring a little

447
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:54,429
star power sometimes and we've had many

448
00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:56,019
exciting guests today we have a very

449
00:19:54,430 --> 00:20:00,130
exciting guest who's going to say a few

450
00:19:56,019 --> 00:20:04,000
words and introduce the head of the olcc

451
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:07,300
you know it's so cool because usually

452
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,150
our big stars we've got to import from

453
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:13,119
LA or someplace around the world but

454
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:17,019
this big star lives right in Oregon in

455
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:20,229
Southern Oregon and grows cannabis and

456
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:22,299
loves cannabis and has a lot of feelings

457
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:26,410
towards cannabis and hasn't necessarily

458
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:29,289
been so outwardly vocal waiting for the

459
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:31,540
right time and today he's just gonna say

460
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:34,539
a couple words about how he feels about

461
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:38,049
our state cannabis reform and opioid

462
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:41,769
addiction so without further ado please

463
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:48,009
give a warm warm Oregon welcome to the

464
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:52,200
one and only mr. Jim Belushi go make

465
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:52,200
some noise Jim Belushi in the house

466
00:20:54,160 --> 00:21:03,140
thank you very nice introduction I am

467
00:20:58,819 --> 00:21:06,649
here because of the free taco bar this

468
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:08,600
afternoon I understood that I was going

469
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:10,340
to be this morning and when you

470
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:13,149
announced that I moved it to the

471
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:13,149
afternoon and I'm a little disappointed

472
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:22,339
so let me get over that for a minute I

473
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:25,279
love tacos I do live in Los Angeles

474
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:27,678
by the way Alex and I have a beautiful

475
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,569
little farm on the Rogue River in Eagle

476
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,548
Point in Southern Oregon right in the

477
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:38,178
middle of the banana Belle I have a

478
00:21:31,548 --> 00:21:41,509
small beautiful grow there and I have

479
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:44,929
become so intimate with this plant by

480
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:48,650
growing it cultivating and curing it

481
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:52,070
cutting it selling it it's just brought

482
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:53,870
me closer and closer to myself and it's

483
00:21:52,069 --> 00:21:58,210
brought me closer and closer to the

484
00:21:53,869 --> 00:22:05,000
miracles and the spirit of this plant I

485
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:09,919
I believe cannabis I wrote it down

486
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:14,048
I believe the wellness of cannabis

487
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:22,130
includes helping to heal Alzheimer's

488
00:22:14,048 --> 00:22:24,349
back pain headaches anxiety seizures the

489
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:28,340
wellness of cannabis also includes the

490
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:31,099
enhancement of creativity the spark in

491
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:34,279
the spirit the enhancement of the sounds

492
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:38,168
of music the taste of foods the touch of

493
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:42,440
your lover's skin but also includes

494
00:22:38,169 --> 00:22:47,600
euphoria joyfulness higher consciousness

495
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:51,110
all this is the wellness of canvas and I

496
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:55,009
am getting closer and closer to all that

497
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:57,500
I have been educated here in Oregon

498
00:22:55,009 --> 00:23:00,009
Oregon is a great state and that is the

499
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:04,509
great state of cannabis by the way

500
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:06,730
I think Oregon is gonna lead leave this

501
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:10,150
country in the great quality and a great

502
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:12,069
science that they produce here I visited

503
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:14,860
with finalists and all the different

504
00:23:12,069 --> 00:23:16,178
Sciences here it's just mark about what

505
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:18,909
they're doing here I'm just overwhelmed

506
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:22,240
by it the more I get into it the more I

507
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:25,179
realize I don't know it's just a

508
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:28,929
wonderful plant to be engaged with it's

509
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:31,540
just changing my life personally I had

510
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:36,809
an experience last year I've visited

511
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:39,308
over wow maybe 2025 dispensaries and

512
00:23:36,808 --> 00:23:41,740
they're waiting in line to come in and

513
00:23:39,308 --> 00:23:44,319
take a photograph and try out the

514
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:47,200
cannabis setup and be produced and I met

515
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:52,329
a veteran who was shaking a little bit

516
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:54,308
and staring at me and and he walked up

517
00:23:52,329 --> 00:24:00,189
to me and he said you know I was a medic

518
00:23:54,308 --> 00:24:02,410
in Iraq and I saw things that happened

519
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:06,220
to the human body that nobody should

520
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:11,380
ever see in their life he said my PTSD

521
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:13,870
is this so bad that I I have three kids

522
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:17,950
that I have trouble relating to a wife

523
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:24,548
and I can't sleep and he said your black

524
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:26,650
diamond OG is the only strain I have

525
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:31,210
found where I can talk to my children

526
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:33,540
and I can sleep and he like had tears in

527
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:38,470
his eyes and he hugged me and I wanna

528
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:40,839
thank I didn't make this stuff man this

529
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:44,110
has been here for a long time I I just

530
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:48,970
you know I think it just planted Isis he

531
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:51,369
goes you are the Stuart I don't know how

532
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:53,980
that's pretty cool and we all are

533
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:55,779
stewards from this medicine to heal our

534
00:24:53,980 --> 00:25:00,640
community the number one fear in life is

535
00:24:55,779 --> 00:25:04,149
death the number two fear in life is the

536
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,700
collapse of family that is a number two

537
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:12,340
fear where their family falls apart from

538
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:18,009
divorce disease PTSD

539
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:21,730
addiction a death in the family creates

540
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:24,569
trauma 80% of the families that

541
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:31,000
experience this kind of disease or

542
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:33,819
trouble don't succeed the families

543
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,970
collapse and I believe that this

544
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:39,399
medicine is going to help our community

545
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:42,910
and help our families get back and not

546
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:46,720
collapse there was a woman whose son had

547
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:50,070
40 seizures a day she said he would drop

548
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:54,190
like he'd cut a string on a Marinette

549
00:25:50,069 --> 00:25:56,019
she didn't know what to do she was in

550
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:59,440
that bedroom with that boy every night

551
00:25:56,019 --> 00:26:04,210
never sleeping with her husband because

552
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:06,789
they care for this child and he was in

553
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:12,789
hospice taking all kinds of drugs and

554
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:15,220
she used some CBD oil changed his kid's

555
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:19,619
life changed the family's life that

556
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:22,269
family almost blew up so I just love

557
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:24,399
what this dude I'm proud to be a Stewart

558
00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:27,639
and I'm proud of all you for being a

559
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:32,740
sewer and keeping this that's going I

560
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:36,580
mean I believe that I believe if we knew

561
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:40,779
what we know now about cannabis in the

562
00:26:36,579 --> 00:26:42,819
70s if we knew what it was capable of if

563
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:46,899
we knew it was medicine instead of a

564
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:52,960
drug there'd be a lot more people alive

565
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:55,060
today and it is not a gateway drug it is

566
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,799
a gateway to healing it's a gateway to

567
00:26:55,059 --> 00:27:08,009
medicine as a gateway to spirituality

568
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:12,389
I am grateful to be here I'm proud to be

569
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:14,609
in Oregon and I have gotten to know a

570
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:17,490
lot of people and our next speaker I've

571
00:27:14,609 --> 00:27:18,689
gotten to know this year pretty well

572
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:23,609

573
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:27,090
acquaintance okay was it joking you got

574
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:28,529
that good I'm so glad I I have been in

575
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:32,279
relationship with them because we've

576
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:34,950
been discussing it's very difficult to

577
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:36,990
get done there's a lot of little things

578
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:39,059
going on but we've been discussing an

579
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:43,769
opiate trade program to begin here in

580
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:46,740
Portland where we can get free marijuana

581
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:49,759

582

583
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:56,309
prescriptions and I know that every

584
00:27:53,130 --> 00:28:00,330
farmer and every manufacturer in Oregon
