1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,730
this is a panel on differentiating in

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:11,308
the CBD space the crowded CBD space and

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,710
we've got a really an interesting panel

4
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:16,289
of diverse views

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,880
that'll be chiming in give you guys more

6
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:23,929
perspective from different smart minds

7
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:27,419
on how to accomplish the differentiation

8
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:30,599
grow your products and brands in the

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,480
panel we have and I'm going to sort of

10
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,250
give them up just name them and they'll

11
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,379
give you a quick once-over on on who

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,640
they are and a little bit about their

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:45,989
companies so first I've got Scott Goldy

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:48,109
CEO of golden seed yeah I am Scott Gould

15
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:51,119
a the CEO of golden seed in golden seed

16
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:54,210
as a corporation and we're involved in

17
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,738
both the cannabis and the have space so

18
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,320
we're vertically integrated in both of

19
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:00,899
those sectors started in December of

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,909
seventeen and our first crops will be

21
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,030
coming to market in the next couple

22
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:05,030
months

23
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,118

carefully curated compendium of laws and

35
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:44,899
regulations pertaining to hemp and

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,899
cannabis here in the Golden State

37
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:52,439
hello this really works

38
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,560
my name is Ken Stratton I'm a partner

39
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:58,798
with the law firm Rockaway law group the

40
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,079
firm was established in 2011 we have

41
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,409
three offices in the state one in LA one

42
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:07,589
in San Francisco and one in Santa Rosa

43
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:10,590
my practice is about 50/50 corporate and

44
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,689
litigation and firm-wide the litigation

45
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,909
as

46
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:18,770
50/50 between defense work and

47
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:20,090
plaintiffs work before rockaway I was in

48
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,350
private practice as a laborer an

49
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,270
employment attorney and a corporate

50
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:26,889
securities attorney for ten years and

51
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:30,620
then I went in house and I helped run

52
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:32,299
three life science companies as senior

53
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,819
legal counsel

54
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,860
two of the life science companies were

55
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:39,709
publicly traded with about fifty five

56
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,380
hundred million dollars market cap both

57
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:44,080
developing therapeutics for different

58
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:46,219
indications in the human body and

59
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,540
another was an international

60
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:49,539
conglomerate called Medtronic

61
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,569
alright guys so I think we're gonna jump

62
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:08,718
right in this is a it's a very deep

63
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:12,169
field and I think feeling exactly what

64
00:03:08,718 --> 00:03:13,699
the title that this panel is I think

65
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:14,988
it's a really really poignant question

66
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:17,988
and I think there are some direct

67
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:20,140
answers that you'll get from everybody

68
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:24,079
on here so we'll start out by saying

69
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:27,529
what are the keys to differentiate your

70
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:31,639
product or brand in CBD I will start

71
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:35,989
with Scott yeah so we started growing

72
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:37,849
him last year actually and the key for

73
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:40,789
differentiation I think for us is a

74
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:43,938
couple things first we have proprietary

75
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:46,608
genetics that have been developed really

76
00:03:43,938 --> 00:03:48,378
over the last decade and the uniqueness

77
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:52,849
about them is that they're very high CBD

78
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:55,340
percentages some over 20% a very very

79
00:03:52,848 --> 00:03:57,949
high terpene profiles and very unique

80
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,049
terpene profiles so if we're going out

81
00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:02,568
to the market and we could have those

82
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:04,219
types of attributes it lends its up

83
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:06,649
really well well for instance the

84
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:08,568
smokeable hemp and Dean and I are

85
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,000
working in a partnership to create a

86
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:13,429
retail product that would be him

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,900
cigarettes and that's something that's

88
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,000
very large and your up and I think it's

89
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,129
gonna be very large here in the United

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,139
States and they're really at the

91
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:23,269
forefront of that but what they're

92
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:27,348
looking for were the type of genetics

93
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:28,728
and have CBD that we can grow the second

94
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:31,728
thing that I think is really unique for

95
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:35,029
us in terms of branding is that we grow

96
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:37,069
everything organically even to have so

97
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:38,719
it's very sustainable we have our own

98
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:41,469
worm farm we create our own soil

99
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,150
amendments no chemicals or pesticides

100
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:46,310
and so we're meeting with the wellness

101
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:48,319
company last week you know they're

102
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,720
selling products that are there to

103
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,610
benefit people they love that kind of

104
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,070
ethos and it'll actually be incorporated

105
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:58,280
into their marketing of their products

106
00:04:55,069 --> 00:05:00,168
and then I think for us because we're

107
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:02,149
vertically integrated

108
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:04,759
you know we've started with growing we

109
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:06,500
have seed production eventually we want

110
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,829
to get into our own retail products as

111
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,829
well maybe some of our own hemp

112
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:18,310
with Dean AMP cigarette and other

113
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:22,508
products so that would be my answer I

114
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:25,689
think there's gonna mean to be a focus

115
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:27,669
on product safety and on testing there

116
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:30,459
needs to be more awareness that cannabis

117
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:33,008
and hemp are both incredibly effective

118
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:35,859
fight over mediators that means that

119
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:38,979
they are organisms that remove toxins

120
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,729
from the soil and these toxins usually

121
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:44,468
end up on the plant body itself and so

122
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:47,168
this awareness of cannabis and hemp are

123
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:50,829
both bio accumulators and that they can

124
00:05:47,168 --> 00:05:54,250
accumulate toxins really then the next

125
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:56,589
question is which products are safe for

126
00:05:54,250 --> 00:06:00,250
human consumption and that's where I

127
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:03,339
think a focus on safety and on testing

128
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:06,788
will really give somebody in a very

129
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:08,408
crowded marketplace an edge because they

130
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:10,658
can say our products are tested

131
00:06:08,408 --> 00:06:13,000
everybody knows that cannabis is super

132
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:15,038
effective at removing toxins from their

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,278
environment and so you have to be

134
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:21,339
careful to not be buying gas station CBD

135
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:23,680
you know because those products are

136
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:26,339
probably very poisonous so I think

137
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,228
that's one thing the other part in

138
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:31,119
differentiation is building a brand and

139
00:06:29,228 --> 00:06:34,120
in order to build a brand you need to be

140
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,598
able to first of all pick a distinctive

141
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,129
name don't say you know north northern

142
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:41,560
emerald wellness because that's so

143
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:43,689
generic and it doesn't really like stand

144
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,360
out from other similar names so you want

145
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:49,120
to pick something that's either what's

146
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,778
called in trademark law fanciful some

147
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,069
made-up name or you know hopefully

148
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:57,639
arbitrary something that has nothing to

149
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:59,979
do with describing this brand and also

150
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:03,460
tell a story like the brands that really

151
00:06:59,978 --> 00:07:06,908
resonate have authentic stories you know

152
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:09,128
I'm thinking about how Lowell forints

153
00:07:06,908 --> 00:07:12,490
had like some invented story about

154
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:15,819
Lowell in 1913 and you know it was

155
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:18,158
really like a man wearing a ball wearing

156
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:19,539
a suit was really the story it was kind

157
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:22,089
of like a made-up story with no

158
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:23,439
authenticity so I think

159
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:25,959
when you're building a brand you want to

160
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,519
you know focus on telling a story that's

161
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:29,638
authentic like what I'm hearing from you

162
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:34,049
as you know a focus on sustainability

163
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:36,699
and organic inputs and you know that

164
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:39,310
resonates with the consumers in the

165
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:41,500
marketplace so I think building a strong

166
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:43,780
brand is important now try to leave some

167
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:49,509
stuff for Kenton agreed now pen I think

168
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:51,638
these network so so said from my

169
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:53,469
perspective and I approach it from the

170
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,300
perspective of a corporate attorney who

171
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:57,250
has raised capital for countless

172
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,520
companies and helped them sell

173
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:02,290
themselves helped founders realize their

174
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:06,459
liquidity of being events in the dreams

175
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:09,100
to grow businesses that are going to

176
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:10,659
last for the long term right you can

177
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,970
differentiate all you want but what you

178
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:15,340
want to do is differentiate yourself in

179
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,680
a way that is destined to last for the

180
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:19,079
long term and to me it all comes down to

181
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,000
trust

182
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:23,769
maintaining trust so when it comes to

183
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
making claims that you can't support

184
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:30,699
that defies and breaks down trust and

185
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,019
then control and discipline right so if

186
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:33,788
you're trying to build a brand and

187
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:36,069
you're trying to convince people that

188
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:37,538
your product is always going to be on

189
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,599
the shelves and will always have the

190
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:43,509
same sort of impact and effect on your

191
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,190
body it's not good if the product

192
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:48,069
doesn't do that it's even worse that the

193
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,630
products not even there right so at the

194
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,660
end of the day having the kind of

195
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:54,700
discipline and control to make sure that

196
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:58,240
you have operational control you have

197
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:00,400
legal control and you're able to to

198
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,680
continue to build that trust all right

199
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,949
so to me the world is divided up into

200
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:08,319
Joule and Walt Disney right so jewel is

201
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:11,560
a company that violated people's trust

202
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,050
because it's pretty clear jewel targeted

203
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:15,699
children in a way that was inappropriate

204
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:19,629
so you know we already know how the FDA

205
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:22,450
feels about CBD products you know don't

206
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:24,370
target children right that's that's not

207
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:27,540
good for a number of reasons but but

208
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:30,879
that violated trust while Disney is

209
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:33,599
every bit as aggressive and successful

210
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,500
as jewel has ever been Walt Disney

211
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,990
single-handedly destroy

212
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,539
a copyright law in America to save

213
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,580
Mickey Mouse right to make sure that

214
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:46,000
Mickey Mouse continue to make them gobs

215
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:49,480
of money into the foreseeable future 200

216
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,940
years how right they're very successful

217
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,580
but they built trust and they had

218
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,800
operational control and I think that's a

219
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:59,710
from my perspective as a corporate

220
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,219
attorney that's what my advice would be

221
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,990
to you

222
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,810
so can I think those are all great

223
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:07,330
answers and sort of my takeaway first I

224
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:12,539
just realized I didn't didn't introduce

225
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:16,440
myself but I helped run but calm and

226
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:19,719
Wagner demas which is a technology that

227
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:24,190
that is patented for the production of

228
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:27,670
pre-rolls and scale I think so I'm I'm

229
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:31,720
an operator an investor a lot like Scott

230
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:34,389
and so I think everything that I heard

231
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,430
resonated with me I think it starts with

232
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:39,819
safety because I don't think you're in

233
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:43,179
the game unless your product is is is at

234
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:46,300
that par I think from there I would say

235
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:49,149
quality I think if you have a quality

236
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:52,479
product irrespective of what sector

237
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:54,699
you're in relative to the other entrance

238
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,629
the competition if you have a great

239
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:00,220
product you're gonna be your your your

240
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:01,720
there you're gonna be positioned to win

241
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,850
you've got a mark and do some other

242
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,170
things but I think at a banal level

243
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:08,470
you've got to know that you can come out

244
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:11,889
with a quality product so for us we were

245
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:15,250
operating in cannabis and it became very

246
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:18,460
evident when the farm bill passed that

247
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:22,539
our technology for rolling pre-rolls

248
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:25,750
was going to be very applicable to hemp

249
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:30,669
and the the type of smokeable hemp flour

250
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:35,169
that certain forward-thinking breeders

251
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:37,959
were creating and Scott happened to be

252
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:41,009
one of those folks who was forward

253
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:44,080
thinking and creating CBD strains

254
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:49,389
essentially over generations Scott's

255
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:51,160
partner was breeding down the T ace

256
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:53,980
from strains that we all know and

257
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:56,350
breeding it into other cannabinoids and

258
00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:01,300
also terpenes so they've got this high

259
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:04,089
Terp flower and then I see my service

260
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:06,879
our asset is is that we build these

261
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:10,270
machines that are able to produce joints

262
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:12,610
unlike tobacco equipment that don't work

263
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:17,409
with sticky residue substances ours do

264
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:20,950
and so now they're sticky hemp and our

265
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:24,850
technology can come together and see a

266
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:27,490
market that is far greater than the five

267
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:29,379
hundred and forty dispensaries that my

268
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,810
our cannabis pre-rolls are in in

269
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:36,009
California so it's just a much bigger

270
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:39,099
addressable market if your resources as

271
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:40,899
a business are conducive to being unique

272
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:45,310
and coming up with a great product I

273
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:49,169
think that's what it is for me so I'll

274
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:52,958
jump to the next question here which is

275
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:55,659
now that we're talking about products

276
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,369
and the fact that quality and all these

277
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:59,500
different factors are gonna be sort of

278
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:04,389
really determining factors that you're

279
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:07,120
gonna win what can you do to take steps

280
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:08,980
to appealing to consumers I think we've

281
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,620
touched on this a little bit but what

282
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,450
can your products do or what can you do

283
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:19,959
with your products to best appeal to

284
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:22,690
consumers let's start with Omar here I

285
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:24,969
would think you know like really being

286
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:27,940
careful with the packaging and labeling

287
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:30,009
and not like over selling the products

288
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,920
not making any medical claims which are

289
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:34,419
for sure gonna draw FDA scrutiny yes you

290
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:37,000
know those are like the pitfalls to

291
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:39,578
avoid it's just basically the

292
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,950
understanding about the medical benefits

293
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:44,259
of CBD is already out there there's no

294
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:47,500
need to be repeating it and drawing FDA

295
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:49,450
scrutiny so I think that's something

296
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,089
important but others are making those

297
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:56,360
claims for us let them it's a good plan

298
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:58,939
I agree Ken about products

299
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,558
well I have to defer to the operational

300
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:04,009
folks for for most of product

301
00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:07,938
development questions but I can I can

302
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:09,318
say that you know as you are thinking

303
00:14:07,938 --> 00:14:11,149
about your products and you're thinking

304
00:14:09,318 --> 00:14:13,099
about differentiating yourself you

305
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:14,389
should also be thinking about protecting

306
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,769
your intellectual property around the

307
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:18,110
products and we've already talked a

308
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:19,999
little bit about trademarks but there

309
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:22,278
are things like trade dress which is

310
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:25,548
it's a trademark for the look and feel

311
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:28,938
of your product I've found my own

312
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:32,808
business experiences that some degree of

313
00:14:28,938 --> 00:14:34,278
consistency helps build that trust it

314
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:36,318
becomes familiar and whatever is

315
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:40,399
familiar is loved and then whatsoever is

316
00:14:36,318 --> 00:14:43,818
loved is bought so that that I find to

317
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:47,509
be important I think anecdotally I would

318
00:14:43,818 --> 00:14:51,528
say that you know I there are a lot of

319
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:53,688
products out there there's a bit of for

320
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:55,669
the the newbies who are going into the

321
00:14:53,688 --> 00:14:58,909
local dispensary it's a bit of an

322
00:14:55,669 --> 00:15:02,899
overwhelming experience if there are

323
00:14:58,909 --> 00:15:06,738
ways to simplify and get your message

324
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:08,808
through clearly and and it works for you

325
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:11,298
then keep driving at home driving at

326
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:13,639
home because I think there's a lot of

327
00:15:11,298 --> 00:15:17,149
noise and a simple consistent message

328
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:19,459
can can help build that brand simple is

329
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:21,708
generally good Scott you've got several

330
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:24,248
SKUs of products what do you think here

331
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:26,748
yeah for us again it was said earlier

332
00:15:24,249 --> 00:15:29,028
creating a lifestyle brand is really the

333
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:31,459
key to creating the enterprise value of

334
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:33,948
the company and for us when we created

335
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:35,539
our golden sea brand a lot of thought

336
00:15:33,948 --> 00:15:38,208
went into that and actually where we

337
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:40,208
located our farm a lot of thought went

338
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:43,638
into that we're in Santa Cruz County the

339
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:45,948
culture of that area is very embracing

340
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:48,438
of cannabis and it always has been

341
00:15:45,948 --> 00:15:51,469
and we're really looking on the cannabis

342
00:15:48,438 --> 00:15:53,509
side to national distribution at some

343
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:57,048
point so we wanted to create a very

344
00:15:53,509 --> 00:16:00,528
iconic California surf brand we

345
00:15:57,048 --> 00:16:02,178
concentrate on serve our music in fact

346
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:04,159
some of the more prominent investors in

347
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:06,558
our company they're already in those

348
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:09,678
sectors you know I see a lot of brands

349
00:16:06,558 --> 00:16:10,429
out there that have very blase names so

350
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:13,220
I'm very and

351
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:15,620
trio very they're not really picking up

352
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:19,600
the spirit of the culture of these

353
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:22,549
industries so and I also agree that the

354
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,460
lifestyle aspect of it you know has to

355
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:27,439
start with the story and our story you

356
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,240
know we have a worm farm and that's

357
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,000
where it all starts so we go for all the

358
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:35,778
way from worms to wheat and then it's

359
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,899
really well branded and distributed in

360
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:40,399
that order worms to eat so let me twist

361
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:44,089
the question a little bit and I'll go

362
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,799
back right back to you Scott and take it

363
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:48,890
down the line so we're talking about how

364
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:51,639
to appeal to consumers is there anything

365
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:55,069
different or what do you need to do to

366
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:58,129
to appeal to investors because this is

367
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:00,950
an industry that it is competitive and

368
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:03,500
funding is something we're all battling

369
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:06,799
for so what can you do with the product

370
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:09,970
skews how can you frame the business for

371
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:13,698
investors and one caveat being that

372
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:16,818
golden seed has just recently launched

373
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:19,670
it's a series or it's a reggae offering

374
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:21,740
in January so we'd love to hear about

375
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:25,220
sort of how you position the brand and

376
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:26,990
how that process going for you so the

377
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,900
capital side of this industry has become

378
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:33,049
very challenging and when we started our

379
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:34,759
our company a couple years ago it's very

380
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:37,879
important for us not to give up control

381
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:39,529
I think Ken mentioned that earlier so we

382
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:43,250
invested quite a bit of our own capital

383
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:45,079
into it we have very little debt and we

384
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,509
waited until our company was far enough

385
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:50,569
along to bring an investment because we

386
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:54,200
have a higher valuation so we start with

387
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:56,689
the Regulation D offering which is been

388
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,179
in the securities act since 1934 and

389
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,910
that's where your selling shares to

390
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:04,490
accredited investors that would be at a

391
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:08,500
lower valuation as we continue to build

392
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:11,829
our brand in 2015 the SEC approved

393
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:15,920
amendment to the Act that allowed for

394
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:19,399
sale of stock to anyone and it's it's

395
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:22,259
anyone really in the world so that's

396
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,960
called Regulation a and we're qualified

397
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:28,170
first week of January of this year to be

398
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,630
the first cannabis cultivator and retail

399
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:35,220
product in the country to be able to

400
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:37,980
sell shares and so yesterday was our 30

401
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,350
day anniversary 30 days since we

402
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,450
launched and right now we have

403
00:18:40,349 --> 00:18:46,469
applications for investment from over a

404
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:48,480
thousand people in 46 states and 17

405
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:51,240
countries literally in every continent

406
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,210
in the world and what that does for us

407
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,700
is not only at most will give up 10% of

408
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,920
our company so we're still in control we

409
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,390
didn't take private equity I think the

410
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,340
capital markets a lot of people are

411
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,500
taking too much money and they're

412
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:06,389
looking for business you know we're a

413
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,000
business that's looking for money we're

414
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:11,610
a credible we're very near-term gonna be

415
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,470
cashflow positive and that's just a

416
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:16,319
great story so through regulation a you

417
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:19,049
raise capital you create brand

418
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:21,359
ambassadors throughout the country when

419
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:22,740
this becomes nationally legal will

420
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,859
already have exposure in all those

421
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:28,319
states so for us we kind of approached

422
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:29,909
it differently but it's gone really well

423
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,220
it's on an investor call last night

424
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:34,259
through over a hundred people out of the

425
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,539
thousand that have already come in and

426
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:39,089
it's just been very well received it's

427
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:40,379
very transparent they take ownership in

428
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:44,159
the company and we communicate really

429
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:48,120
well so it's awesome and I think the

430
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:51,930
benefits will alone only begin to come

431
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:57,750
as these folks are champions for the

432
00:19:51,930 --> 00:20:00,600
brand so I think democratizing that that

433
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:02,579
process is just add so much to a brand

434
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:05,279
now as far as having brand ambassadors

435
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:06,720
out there essentially let's get to the

436
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,029
lawyers who've dealt with this quite a

437
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,480
bit and your view as far as positioning

438
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:14,279
the company towards investment

439
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:17,220
definitely I think something that a lot

440
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:19,230
of my clients were in the hemp world and

441
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,390
creating hemp derive CBD are doing is

442
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,630
they're registering federal trademarks

443
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:26,940
with a US Patent and Trademark Office

444
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:29,490
for all sorts of brands because USPTO

445
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:33,029
will register hemp trademarks after the

446
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,920
farm bill they will not yet register the

447
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:36,170
cannabis

448
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,360
and so now you can have federally

449
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:41,330
enforceable federally registered

450
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:44,629
trademarks for hemp to write products

451
00:20:41,329 --> 00:20:46,759
that the USPTO you know just keeps

452
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:48,650
issuing and so that's something that I

453
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:50,480
think investors will look at is if you

454
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:52,340
don't have any registered trademarks of

455
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,170
the federal level what have you been

456
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:57,319
doing with all this investor capital so

457
00:20:54,170 --> 00:21:00,769
far so I think that makes somebody you

458
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:03,139
know more appealing from the investment

459
00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:05,299
perspective I think your point of like

460
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:08,540
you know recruiting using crowdfunding

461
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:10,669
and regulation a investors all over the

462
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:13,039
country who will later become brand

463
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:15,140
ambassadors is a brilliant idea and I'm

464
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,149
glad to be standing next to the you know

465
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,040
the first company to have done this I've

466
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:21,050
been thinking for years like when will

467
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,789
somebody finally implement crowdfunding

468
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:25,059
and regulation aid for the cannabis

469
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:30,529
industry and you know I would say

470
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:36,289
deserves a round of applause thank you

471
00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:38,660
and I'll pass it on to Kay okay so I

472
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:44,299
probably should say that again these are

473
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:49,040
my opinions only legal advice but my

474
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:51,440
perspective having helped a number of

475
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:56,170
investors make investments and countless

476
00:21:51,440 --> 00:22:00,259
companies raise money it comes down to

477
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:02,960
answer the question two ways one it's

478
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:04,549
about pulling together assets so we

479
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,840
talked about intellectual property

480
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:07,759
assets but there are other really

481
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:09,799
important assets that investors will

482
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:12,170
always look at they'll look at your team

483
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:14,180
so consider your people as your assets

484
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:16,580
they'll look at your supply chain

485
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:18,259
they'll look at your consumer let your

486
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:21,139
customer list though look at the

487
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:23,629
contracts that you have on an earlier

488
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:26,060
panel there were some cautionary tales

489
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:29,030
about not having a clear understanding

490
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:30,919
of who your owners are right so we all

491
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:33,200
understand that in California you can

492
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,090
make a contract just orally you can make

493
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,640
a contract by implication you don't need

494
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:39,829
to write it you can just sign it so we

495
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,040
do see an awful lot of people who step

496
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:42,629
forward

497
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:46,109
when they see some sort of great

498
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:48,750
opportunity to a profit claiming to be

499
00:22:46,109 --> 00:22:52,399
an owner of a cannabis company right so

500
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:55,829
having some degree of good paperwork so

501
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,810
your leases your contracts those are all

502
00:22:55,829 --> 00:23:01,500
assets right to the extent that your

503
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:03,809
contracts don't aren't terminable you've

504
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,970
locked in good rates things like that so

505
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:08,629
you you assemble together all your

506
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:10,069
assets and of course revenue streams

507
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:13,980
[Music]

508
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:16,259
so that's one way to answer it I think

509
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:22,710
the other is more of a process driven

510
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:25,379
one just some suggestions it is very

511
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:31,410
very off-putting to try to bring money

512
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:34,110
in if you are shitshow right and you

513
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:37,140
don't have your things together and

514
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:39,629
lined up it's very hard to do it's very

515
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:43,020
hard to close a deal if you negotiate

516
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:46,020
backwards it's kind of like dating you

517
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:48,809
you really do want to build trust in

518
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:50,970
that relationship too so one of the

519
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:53,549
things that we try to do with our

520
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:56,640
clients is to be very careful in how

521
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:58,859
they present themselves when terms are

522
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,020
proposed how they're proposed the

523
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:04,979
process is really really really

524
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:07,170
important because it is data and in that

525
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:10,259
regard you know it doesn't need to be

526
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:14,009
our firm but but but having someone

527
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:19,049
who's done the process can really really

528
00:24:14,009 --> 00:24:22,829
help and we have been pulled into nearly

529
00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:25,049
failed transactions where there was no

530
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:29,279
legal advice or no business advice

531
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:31,740
frankly and unwinding that and trying to

532
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,170
get it back on to the rails can be very

533
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,269
very difficult I do think there's a lot

534
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:38,580
of value in having someone who's been

535
00:24:36,269 --> 00:24:41,160
through the process many times in your

536
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:43,889
corner to help you with the process of

537
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:46,830
completing that relationship there's a

538
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:49,020
node out there I just want to add a few

539
00:24:46,829 --> 00:24:50,839
things that Ken made me think of you

540
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:53,119
know I've only been in the can I was

541
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:55,279
for a few years now I come from a real

542
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:58,309
estate background about my own

543
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,899
development company for many years and I

544
00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:02,240
see a lot of different companies and

545
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:04,310
sometimes they're too heavily tilted to

546
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,589
the business side and they don't really

547
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:08,419
know that much about the plant or you

548
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:09,909
have people starting with the plant that

549
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:13,160
aren't associated themselves with

550
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:15,050
competent business people and I have

551
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,330
been in front of a lot of investors we

552
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:19,759
had some really large-scale investors

553
00:25:17,329 --> 00:25:21,199
early on in the Regulation D and they do

554
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:25,759
want to see that they want to see

555
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:27,890
competent compliance accounting systems

556
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:30,349
and controls implemented in your in your

557
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:31,190
business and without that I think number

558
00:25:30,349 --> 00:25:33,500
one you're not going to be that

559
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:36,980
successful number two you're not going

560
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:39,259
to get investors I think I fully agree

561
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:41,660
with that if you want to make yourself

562
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:43,430
more attractive to investors basically

563
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,710
reverse engineered the due diligence

564
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:47,539
process and see how they're going to be

565
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,640
looking at you and make sure that all of

566
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:53,289
the metrics are going to be favorable

567
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,290
before you put yourself on the market

568
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:58,640
you know hemp world

569
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:00,409
it's about acres it's not about square

570
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,320
feet like we talked about in cannabis

571
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:04,759
and so when you're going to scale to

572
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:06,740
meet the kind of demand that Deen's

573
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:08,599
company's gonna have you're talking

574
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:10,609
about Hunters acres maybe several

575
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:11,929
hundred acres and then you're getting

576
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:15,079
into really kind of commercial

577
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:17,480
agriculture that's not our experience as

578
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:19,099
a cannabis grower of that scale so it's

579
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,650
very important for us we actually

580
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:23,059
partner with local strawberry farms so

581
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,460
in Santa Cruz County there's five

582
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:27,349
thousand acres of strawberry farms we

583
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:30,110
only deal with organic strawberry

584
00:26:27,349 --> 00:26:32,029
farmers and organic strawberries can

585
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:34,549
only be planted maybe every five years

586
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:37,190
so they need rotation crops and it's

587
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:39,680
been a great experience for us to give

588
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:42,440
our genetics to that farmer and let them

589
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:46,039
grow a consistent and very clean and

590
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:48,259
good product and it is a consistent and

591
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:53,210
clean product by the way should show

592
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:56,200
that was a legal term yes so actually

593
00:26:53,210 --> 00:27:00,620
let me just sort of pin this down so

594
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:03,519
structurally because again this is it is

595
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:05,839
you know a lot of uncertainty here

596
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:08,180
federally and then their departures at

597
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:12,079
the state level on CBD is there a

598
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:15,440
preferred sort of formation structure

599
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:16,970
because we're talking about we're

600
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,640
talking about the ops is is there

601
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:22,309
anything to be lent there as far as kind

602
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,500
of a smarter way to form your company

603
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:29,029
when you go out specifically you to guys

604
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:30,950
I mean I think definitely have having

605
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:32,869
some sort of like corporate entity so

606
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:34,880
that if there's gonna be an audit it's

607
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:36,949
gonna fall on that entity and you know

608
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,350
you always get the protections of the

609
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:42,230
corporate form protection from civil

610
00:27:39,349 --> 00:27:43,909
liability and so I would say definitely

611
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,799
always operate with the legal entity as

612
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:48,410
opposed to being a sole proprietor or

613
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:50,450
just a general partnership sometimes if

614
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:53,240
people work together and they don't have

615
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:54,559
any you know any agreement to the

616
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,289
contrary they never formed a corporation

617
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:59,419
they've never formed an LLC the law in

618
00:27:57,289 --> 00:28:01,639
California will infer that there's a

619
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,930
de-facto partnership and you know now

620
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,600
there's gonna be all sorts of like

621
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:07,850
obligations from one partnership to

622
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:09,799
another so I think it's always good to

623
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:11,480
like Gabe thought to which corporate

624
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:13,369
form you're going to have and follow the

625
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,049
formalities of that corporate structure

626
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:17,149
so you get all the benefits of having a

627
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:19,339
corporation it doesn't do you any good

628
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:21,470
to incorporate with the Secretary of

629
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:23,389
State and not develop any bylaws and

630
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:26,210
never hold any meetings because that

631
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:28,009
corporation will be pierced there's a

632
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:31,809
doctrine known as piercing the corporate

633
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:34,730
veil which would basically go from the

634
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:37,429
immunity from civil liability to immune

635
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:38,809
to civil liability for the individual

636
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:42,519
owners if they don't follow the

637
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:42,519
corporate form yep

638
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:49,099
so there's no one-size-fits-all but I

639
00:28:46,579 --> 00:28:52,789
will say that our firm tends to prefer

640
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:54,859
California corporations largely for the

641
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:56,629
reasons that Omar has gone through it

642
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:59,240
gives a level of protection for the

643
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:01,010
individuals it creates a certain amount

644
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,829
of formality that people are familiar

645
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:06,109
with right so that when you look at most

646
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:09,259
of the investors they know corporations

647
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:11,719
down pat but they're a little less sure

648
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:15,079
what a partnership actually

649
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:19,038
is or what it means corporations allow

650
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:22,490
you to bulk up on shareholders - it's

651
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:23,869
easier to manage a business that has

652
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:26,028
multiple shareholders of your

653
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:31,189
corporation than say a limited liability

654
00:29:26,028 --> 00:29:38,089
company so you know one of my last

655
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:40,639
companies had 12,000 shareholders but it

656
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:43,369
does scale I mean we like California

657
00:29:40,638 --> 00:29:46,939
because we have we had this belief

658
00:29:43,369 --> 00:29:49,819
rightly or wrongly that it will help us

659
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:51,409
if there is ever litigation because we

660
00:29:49,819 --> 00:29:54,259
almost certainly will end up in a

661
00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:56,600
California Court rather than say a

662
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:58,700
Delaware Court and I know that there's a

663
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:01,369
tendency towards Delaware law because

664
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,649
those courts are very predictable smart

665
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:05,298
judges and there's lots of jurisprudence

666
00:30:03,648 --> 00:30:06,678
so you can call upon so you know what to

667
00:30:05,298 --> 00:30:08,869
expect

668
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:11,450
but we don't want to be in Delaware and

669
00:30:08,869 --> 00:30:13,908
that's because cannabis is still illegal

670
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:16,240
in Delaware I guess for like a hemp

671
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:20,120
derived CBD products company I think

672
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,888
Delaware may be a viable option you know

673
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:24,979
in terms of going public in the future

674
00:30:21,888 --> 00:30:26,209
you know because I it's just something

675
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,970
that the market understands how to

676
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:30,740
analyze that's a good well so we

677
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:32,720
actually looked at that and I think

678
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:35,480
Scott may want to chime in as well but

679
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,690
we looked at that and I think the fact

680
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,159
that yes there is there is no cannabis

681
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:42,169
law on the books in Delaware that's one

682
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,240
but at the end of the day there's also I

683
00:30:42,169 --> 00:30:47,778
don't believe of hemp law on the books

684
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,000
so right now you'd be hoping that you

685
00:30:47,778 --> 00:30:52,099
know federal law sort of makes its way

686
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,398
down and so I think when you look at all

687
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:58,969
this even on the hemp side our attorneys

688
00:30:55,398 --> 00:31:02,898
have advised to stay in a state that

689
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:04,879
expressly has legal hemp rights yes god

690
00:31:02,898 --> 00:31:06,888
I just wanted out an additional

691
00:31:04,878 --> 00:31:09,439
complexity in terms of organization

692
00:31:06,888 --> 00:31:12,859
we're in both cannabis and we're in half

693
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,259
and you know because of federal banking

694
00:31:12,859 --> 00:31:17,990
laws a lot of different compliance

695
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:19,878
issues way more compliance in cannabis

696
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:23,210
we found that we had to keep those

697
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:24,028
companies completely separate and even

698
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:26,429
then

699
00:31:24,028 --> 00:31:28,499
you know if you're in HAMP that could

700
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:29,909
affect your landing on other properties

701
00:31:28,499 --> 00:31:32,848
we're kind of going through that right

702
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:35,909
now said be interested you guys take on

703
00:31:32,848 --> 00:31:37,138
that well that's a really good point I

704
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:39,450
was thinking like it you know you could

705
00:31:37,138 --> 00:31:41,128
have a intellectual property holding

706
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:44,999
company because I mean if you're gonna

707
00:31:41,128 --> 00:31:48,178
have one brand with one pillar of that

708
00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:49,618
brand is gonna be this hemp company and

709
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:52,169
the other pillar of the brand is going

710
00:31:49,618 --> 00:31:54,988
to be a cannabis company but they're

711
00:31:52,169 --> 00:31:56,669
gonna have the same you know branding

712
00:31:54,989 --> 00:31:59,369
and they're gonna like have that

713
00:31:56,669 --> 00:32:01,499
synergistic influence then you probably

714
00:31:59,368 --> 00:32:02,939
want to like structure it so that their

715
00:32:01,499 --> 00:32:05,278
core you know that they're basically

716
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:08,519
like licensing the brand from an

717
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:10,079
independent IP Holding Company yes and I

718
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:11,878
think that that goes back to your

719
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,888
initial question of how would you end up

720
00:32:11,878 --> 00:32:15,928
structuring it I you know we do see that

721
00:32:13,888 --> 00:32:19,709
the intellectual property tends to

722
00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:20,940
reside within the IP holding company and

723
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:23,399
then there's a whole bunch of other

724
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,778
holding companies potentially for you

725
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:26,668
know the property ownership and

726
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:29,038
equipment leases right and then license

727
00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:31,080
out to the to the more regulated the

728
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:34,288
other regulated entities operate

729
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:37,398
basically in silos going up to the

730
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:41,460
holdings company at the IP level right

731
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:44,248
yeah so we use organizational groups for

732
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:47,219
all kinds of things and they can be very

733
00:32:44,249 --> 00:32:49,618
strategic and they're particularly

734
00:32:47,219 --> 00:32:52,558
interesting in the regulated cannabis

735
00:32:49,618 --> 00:32:55,618
space because we're all aware of the

736
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:59,178
restrictions that so many places have on

737
00:32:55,618 --> 00:33:01,319
an alienation of the licenses right

738
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:03,419
licenses and the permits and some of the

739
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:05,038
localities are way worse than the state

740
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:07,469
level try to change something at

741
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:10,618
bellflower for example right so you know

742
00:33:07,469 --> 00:33:12,359
it's you can use organizational

743
00:33:10,618 --> 00:33:14,278
groupings for a really really good

744
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:16,108
purpose and I have one other thing

745
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:19,169
that's not so much corporate formation

746
00:33:16,108 --> 00:33:21,388
but it's just a it dropped in my mind

747
00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:25,700
when talking about the forum of dispute

748
00:33:21,388 --> 00:33:28,199
resolution I am a big fan of arbitration

749
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:30,298
arbitration and every single commercial

750
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:34,859
agreement arbitration and every single

751
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:36,259
share purchase agreement arbitration in

752
00:33:34,858 --> 00:33:37,939
employment agree

753
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:39,710
those are a little tricky but they can't

754
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:42,620
be done they're still enforceable here

755
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:46,190
in California there are lots of good

756
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:48,469
reasons for it the two that probably

757
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:53,900
matter most to this group first as you

758
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:55,789
can almost by contract shape the kinds

759
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,590
of disputes and the kinds of remedies

760
00:33:55,789 --> 00:34:01,159
available to the parties so you have

761
00:33:57,589 --> 00:34:03,470
tremendous power to get exactly what you

762
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:07,100
want in a given relationship and the

763
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:09,079
other is its completely private and it's

764
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:11,929
in front of someone pretty much of your

765
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:15,889
own choosing so if you're worried about

766
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:18,889
being in front of a 75 year old who is

767
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:22,039
you know dead set against what you do

768
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:24,289
and think you are evil into the

769
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:27,230
courtroom and you can't really strike

770
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:28,789
them for for that you really can't you

771
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:30,860
could try but you're not gonna be

772
00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:34,009
successful but you can choose your

773
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:36,769
arbiter and as the industry gets older

774
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:44,480
and we have a working experience we'll

775
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:46,519
get to know who the other reason why

776
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,010
arbitration is so appealing and why so

777
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:51,590
many cannabis or you know amp derived

778
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:54,650
CBD agreements have arbitration clauses

779
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:57,170
is because the justice system is broken

780
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:59,750
when it comes to resolution of civil

781
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:01,340
disputes it takes approximately seven

782
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:04,369
years to get from filing of a complaint

783
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:07,039
to a judgment in California just because

784
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:08,659
the criminal cases take precedence they

785
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,849
have all sorts of deadlines some time

786
00:35:08,659 --> 00:35:13,129
limits and if you don't get prosecuted

787
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:14,690
within the speedy trial rights then the

788
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,910
prosecution has to be dismissed and

789
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:19,269
therefore in custody criminal cases

790
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:22,399
basically go to the front of the

791
00:35:19,269 --> 00:35:24,050
judicial processing order and it takes

792
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,430
like years to get justice in the

793
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:30,460
California courts so that's a big reason

794
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:32,659
why arbitration is you know becoming

795
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:34,849
increasingly more common in the cannabis

796
00:35:32,659 --> 00:35:36,739
world and now we have you know like

797
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:37,519
private dispute resolution companies

798
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:41,000
like jams

799
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:43,039
they have cannabis aware neutrals

800
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,139
whereas for a long time like you know

801
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:48,110
even finding neutrals that were aware of

802
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:52,719
cannabis was very difficult

803
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:55,880
interesting so let's enough about laws

804
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:58,519
let's let's take it maybe thirty thirty

805
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:02,450
thousand feet we've talked about brands

806
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:05,630
ops formation one of the interesting

807
00:36:02,449 --> 00:36:07,189
dynamics happening I think is that

808
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:10,300
you're seeing different types of

809
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:12,860
entrance into the space you see folks

810
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:19,789
that are essentially sort of wellness

811
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:22,360
brands coming in and again working off

812
00:36:19,789 --> 00:36:26,360
that ethos and then you're also seeing

813
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:30,380
cannabis brands who understand the space

814
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:32,090
and obviously are looking for

815
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:34,070
diversification because they've got

816
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:35,809
resources that are really conducive to

817
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:38,300
him so you've seen these two factors

818
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:41,090
come in and sort of clash just

819
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:43,700
interestingly wanted to hear your guys's

820
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:46,910
opinions on how that landscape is going

821
00:36:43,699 --> 00:36:52,129
to look of CBD companies sort of

822
00:36:46,909 --> 00:36:53,779
globally I just my perspective starting

823
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:55,910
out as a cannabis company and moving

824
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:57,880
into M there's a lot of cannabis

825
00:36:55,909 --> 00:37:00,739
companies that are diversifying into

826
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:05,450
hemp flour I mean the distribution is

827
00:37:00,739 --> 00:37:08,959
different but selling CBD products but

828
00:37:05,449 --> 00:37:10,609
hemp flour hemp terpenes we're seeing a

829
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,860
lot of people in the camps will try to

830
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:17,090
get into that space some were

831
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:18,860
considering ourselves I think you know

832
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:20,630
there's a lot of growth in the hemp

833
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:23,840
industry because a lot of the people who

834
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:26,869
were afraid of euphoria that in the

835
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,539
undesirable side effect of cannabis are

836
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:32,480
completely okay with like CBD and with

837
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:34,730
the hemp effects and so I think there's

838
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,519
may like whoever wanted cannabis is

839
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:38,750
already like a consumer is my belief but

840
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:40,940
there's many people who are trying to

841
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:42,739
transition from all these opioid pain

842
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:45,019
medicines who will find tremendous

843
00:37:42,739 --> 00:37:48,349
relief in CBD and that's a tremendous

844
00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:50,449
growth market and we also have like the

845
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:53,150
boomer population that you know it's now

846
00:37:50,449 --> 00:37:54,549
looking for alternatives to opioid

847
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:57,280
painkillers and

848
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:59,170
- like the whole pharmaceutical

849
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,540
cocktails that they're being described

850
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:03,760
and they're looking for like one

851
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:06,279
alternative herbal solution so we do see

852
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,680
I mean I think you know we haven't

853
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:11,920
really it's it's hard to predict now

854
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:14,409
what its gonna look like but we're gonna

855
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,210
see like a lot more innovation you know

856
00:38:14,409 --> 00:38:18,250
especially as there's like different

857
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,780
formulations when I see cannabis drinks

858
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:22,989
we haven't really seen the full

859
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:24,940
development of cannabis drinks just like

860
00:38:22,989 --> 00:38:27,879
10 years ago it would be difficult to

861
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:30,400
predict that the vape cartridges would

862
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,590
be one of the biggest segments of the

863
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,599
cannabis industry I think now it's

864
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:36,340
difficult to predict what the next big

865
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:37,690
summit will be but it's gonna be it's

866
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:40,269
gonna involve technology and

867
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:42,190
technological innovation they will and

868
00:38:40,269 --> 00:38:45,009
then it's a super dynamic space so now

869
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:45,970
they're it's off you know 35% in the

870
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:47,320
last three months

871
00:38:45,969 --> 00:38:50,230
right so room for new innovative

872
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:53,500
products I agree that it'll be a

873
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:57,010
confluence of folks coming from

874
00:38:53,500 --> 00:39:00,460
different sectors that bring I think

875
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:02,500
different viewpoints and and different

876
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:05,559
stories that they can craft to I think

877
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:07,119
different segments of the audience so

878
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:09,730
let's do this I think we have time for

879
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,829
maybe one question maybe one question

880
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:18,360
let's see one question for Dean and Omar

881
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:19,809
and Ken it's got who's got one question

882
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:22,150
one

883
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:24,549
oh all the way they're always in the

884
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:25,750
back never fails when Iraq stand in the

885
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:30,910
back there in the front then when I

886
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:32,860
stand on the front exercise I had a way

887
00:39:30,909 --> 00:39:36,789
to make them work I remind you to

888
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:41,079
download the huva app also the after

889
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:45,190
party tonight at Pier 23 thank you if

890
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:47,319
you are not expecting outside closer can

891
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:49,119
you hear me yep if you're not expecting

892
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,670
outside investors or don't need outside

893
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:54,489
investors do you still recommend having

894
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:57,849
a California corporation over an LLC if

895
00:39:54,489 --> 00:40:00,789
you are in the hemp space as a farmer or

896
00:39:57,849 --> 00:40:05,529
in the cannabis space as a farmer what

897
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:08,170
the lawyers go so do you think that you

898
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:20,800
can keep your membership down below say

899
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:23,950
35 yes so I think it probably isn't the

900
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:27,730
most important decision on your plate if

901
00:40:23,949 --> 00:40:31,239
you're already an LLC just continue to

902
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:38,559
be one operating agreements are very

903
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:43,829
flexible corporate affairs if you will

904
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:43,829
match your business interests perfectly

905
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:52,360
I think the big appeal of an LLC is

906
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:55,060
streamlined corporate governance but in

907
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:57,160
California we have a statutory entity

908
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:59,500
called a closed corporation that also

909
00:40:57,159 --> 00:41:02,799
offers streamlined corporate governance

910
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:04,599
in a corporate form and so that's also

911
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,440
an option to consider it would be like a

912
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:10,630
closed corporation and you know many

913
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,760
wine companies in Sonoma County my home

914
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:17,590
county are closed corporations like all

915
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:19,300
the wineries and just because it's

916
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:25,539
they're very easy to manage you don't

917
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:27,940
really have to so good question my two

918
