00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,599
everybody I have a

11
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:48,640
question if you allow me to to have a

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:51,039
morning exercise to raise the hand who

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:57,239
in this room

14
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:57,239
thinks that prohibition actually should

15
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,919
remain okay

16
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:10,039
what do you think do you does this

17
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:13,519
prohibition serve any good

18
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:16,479
purpose maybe maybe not I think it's

19
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:18,438
quite important to to speak about the

20
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:23,560
fact where we

21
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:26,158
are um I've been around for 35 years as

22
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:29,920
a practitioner working with people in

23
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,159
addiction and prevention and 15 years in

24
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,200
policy

25
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:36,840
making uh directly accountable to the

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,240
Prime Minister some with six prime

27
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:44,719
minister uh

28
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:47,560
uh giving reports and monitoring reports

29
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:49,319
of all drugs but alcoh Alcohol Tobacco

30
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,560
gambling as well in my country and

31
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:55,478
digital addictions at this

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,840
moment uh so looking at data I have a

33
00:01:55,478 --> 00:02:02,319
Monitoring Center under my office as

34
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:05,320
well um so I've been looking at the data

35
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:08,959
over and over and over and over and it

36
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:11,280
took me several years to understand

37
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,959
what's act what is the the the the

38
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,039
situation with prohibition what what

39
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,719
actually

40
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:20,359
prohibition did to to the whole

41
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:21,800
situation I think it's quite important

42
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,000
to to

43
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:29,360
analyze uh what is actually possible and

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,360
what is not

45
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:40,799
um this is the UK cure I'm not sure if

46
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,800
you uh have seen this it's uh it's uh in

47
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,640
several reports it's written by uh the

48
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,640
emcdda Monitoring Center you might have

49
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,759
heard about this uh Monitoring Center

50
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:55,639
it's a agency uh run by European

51
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:58,639
commission and it's based in Lisbon and

52
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:00,759
actually it says that when we look any

53
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,559
at any regulation

54
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:05,000
we have two extremes one extreme is

55
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,319
unregulated

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,199
Market absolutely unlimited access and

57
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:14,639
we used to have this with alcohol

58
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:16,479
even sell

59
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:20,158
underage

60
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:23,598
uh uh with tobacco as well it's I grew

61
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:25,719
up in the in the time where as a child I

62
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:28,359
was able to go to a shop and buy

63
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:30,080
cigarettes and buy alcohol no problem

64
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,200
was not allowed in restaurants but it

65
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,680
was allowed in chobs today it's not

66
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:38,679
possible I mean not possible in inverted

67
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,400
Comas because sometimes it's uh it's

68
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,840
very easy for

69
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,920
teenagers and on the other hand it's the

70
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:51,719
uh prohibition prohibition Prohibition

71
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:54,399
in terms as we as we know it in illicit

72
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:56,039
drugs and we experience in other parts

73
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,719
in the world with

74
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:02,438
alcohol which is under criminal

75
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:06,560
sanctions can have prohibited uh items

76
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:10,400
or Goods or or food for example which is

77
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:13,039
not uh prohibited under the the criminal

78
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,079
sanctions but with cannabis and Other

79
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:19,879
Drugs we have it under criminal

80
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,478
sanctions Czech Republic as as many of

81
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:25,519
you might know is the one of the

82
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:28,918
countries with the most liberal um

83
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:31,799
liberal laws we decriminalize position

84
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:36,079
for personal use a few decades

85
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:40,120
ago but on the other hand we still have

86
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:43,000
14% of people in prison for drugs

87
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,720
offenses how is that

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,680
possible

89
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:52,199
uh it doesn't mean that 40 14% of the

90
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:56,000
people who are in

91
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:59,160
prison is represents the the amount of

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,720
criminal activities it's only three drug

93
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:06,199
drug um uh drug criminal activities is

94
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,199
only 3% but 14% of of the people in

95
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:12,960
prison is because these people serve

96
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:15,439
longer sentences than many other many

97
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:20,239
other prisoners longer sentences than

98
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:23,079
sexual assault child abuse uh domestic

99
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,960
violence this is the the the fact of

100
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:28,519
current state of plate still today more

101
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:30,399
than half of these people are for

102
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:33,680
cannabis

103
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:37,519
that's across the the the EU EU and it's

104
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:41,120
across the world because it's very

105
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:45,560
simple when people are caught with 20 30

106
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,038
40 plants it's kilos if you for example

107
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,360
in Czech Republic we produce

108
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:51,680
methamphetamin people are caught with

109
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,520
with methamphetamin with few grams they

110
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,560
get two years in prison if you have 20

111
00:05:54,519 --> 00:06:00,879
kilos you get you are in higher uh

112
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:03,439
paragraphs and you get five years

113
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:07,399
so uh

114
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:09,759
but in fact in Czech Republic for longer

115
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:11,038
time already we have medical cannabis

116
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,800
since

117
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:17,598
2013 I believe we are we were globally

118
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,400
the the the the first country allowing

119
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:22,959
medical cannabis according to the law I

120
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,719
mean of course you know that Holland and

121
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:30,239
few other countries did it before us but

122
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:33,440
legis first legislation was uh approved

123
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,280
by the incb inspection which is the

124
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:40,598
inspection for un bodies un

125
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:47,079
ODC uh on CND

126
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:50,079
2013 2021 we we allowed 1% of thhc in in

127
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:51,758
so-called technical cannabis or

128
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:56,079
hemp

129
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:58,639
uh this year we passed a bill uh through

130
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:01,079
the Parliament and it was notified by

131
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,879
European Union which we call psychom

132
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:08,120
modulatory substances which is empty

133
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:11,479
list actually we created a new category

134
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:14,519
we have uh for products which are for

135
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:17,719
human consumption uh you have food you

136
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:20,918
have medic medicines and then now we

137
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:24,120
have third category in the EU uh which

138
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:26,560
is psychom modulatory substances and

139
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,800
under this bill I mean this is an empty

140
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,000
list and the government will put

141
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,199
substances on on this list after some uh

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,720
some

143
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,560
evaluation it's actually two list one is

144
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:41,400
the evaluating list for for maximum two

145
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,918
years and then there is a permanent list

146
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:48,359
uh which will allow probably first

147
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:50,799
instance will be Crome and uh we we

148
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:55,120
talking about the thhc I mean the

149
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:59,038
products with thhc up to one or maybe 2%

150
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,759
and uh and uh we also talking about hhc

151
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,000
for example ex and other products of of

152
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,720
similar

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,158
sort um we ban hhc recently only until

154
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,159
the end of this year waiting for this

155
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:16,839
bill to come and after we we say okay we

156
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:19,800
will probably regulate with specialized

157
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:22,239
shops uh and very strict regulations

158
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,759
stricter than than alcohol I stricter

159
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,680
than

160
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:30,560
tobacco

161
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,000
uh and we are waiting I I uh drafted a

162
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,080
new bill

163
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,639
for

164
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,080
um

165
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:41,199
regulating nonmedical use of cannabis

166
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,080
more than

167
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:48,200
1% uh we talking about 20% of

168
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,440
THC and that should be introduced to the

169
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,480
parliament this this

170
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,200
year and I'll explain what's the

171
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:01,278
troubles around

172
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:03,000
that but before before I'll get into the

173
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:06,078
legal

174
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,440
battle uh I want to also

175
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:12,639
say we have to be aware that it's not

176
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,760
only legal battles that we fight in and

177
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:18,159
it's not

178
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:22,240
only um it's not only ideology that we

179
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:24,639
fight in we also figh in or battling I

180
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,200
don't know how to put it we

181
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,879
are standing in the whole process

182
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,680
against other in

183
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:36,399
Industries legal and

184
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:39,120
illegal of course most obvious one

185
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,078
alcohol uh I mean I remember a couple of

186
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:46,560
years ago my colleague sat with alcohol

187
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:49,000
uh Industries and you have uh of course

188
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,159
beer you have wine and you have uh the

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,759
spirits yes they are usually divided

190
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:54,719
they fight against each other when but

191
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:57,240
when it comes to to cannabis they're

192
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,879
very United and one of the leaders of

193
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:03,120
the spirit industry said

194
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:07,278
we will make everything and we put all

195
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,360
the possible money to stop your your uh

196
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,600
cannabis

197
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:15,560
regulation without shame uh directly

198
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,720
told us in in in a in a public u in a

199
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:20,958
public

200
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,560
debate uh of course we have illegal

201
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,278
industry which is

202
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:27,759
extremely

203
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:30,360
rich and um I have

204
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,958
a maybe some some of you already heard

205
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:37,720
me speaking about it I have this

206
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:39,719
Declassified EU I mean EU CIA report

207
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,959
which speaks about people like vikor

208

to to dislike of many people in the KGB

222
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,440
so I don't want to blame KGB as such but

223
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,278
to to to the to the dislike of many

uh heroin from from uh from

228
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:48,360
Afghanistan I I have to I don't have

229
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,440
time to speak about it I spent uh a long

230
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,879
time in Afghanistan myself and in

231
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,000
Colombia Bolivia so that would be long

232
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,000
stories to speak about this one if

233
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,078
anybody is interested I have the report

234
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,720
here so we standing against legal

235
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:04,159
Industries very powerful legal

236
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,560
industries of course you will hear some

237
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:09,799
of the industries from Big Pharma as

238
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:12,278
well uh not been very happy about it we

239
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:14,039
have um alcohol industry and then we

240
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:17,078
have illegal Industries which are as

241
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:22,519
power powerful as the legal ones using

242
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:25,319
also legal um legal um uh instruments

243
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:29,720
against it like campaign for

244
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,839
example um so that's not easy

245
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,839
and

246
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:39,920
then uh of course we have sorry I'll

247
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:45,440
skip this then we have um

248
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:47,958
uh then we have uh the the international

249
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,760
uh International laws and then we have

250
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:52,958
European laws which is which is even com

251
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:56,399
more complicated for

252
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,399
us stand

253
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:01,120
here so uh

254
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:09,439
I'll I won't go to to all

255
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:13,159
the

256
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:16,399
uh so this is a council

257
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:19,759
conclusion the framework made by the

258
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:22,958
European Union which actually says that

259
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:26,679
apart from personal possession for

260
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:32,439
personal use it's not allowed and it

261
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:35,958
even sets a number of years or or it

262
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:40,120
says the legal standards how countries

263
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:46,759
in the EU should criminalize possession

264
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:49,000
of of what drugs of course sale and and

265
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:51,838
production so apart from personal

266
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,679
position all the other activities

267
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:59,240
according the EU law is not allowed and

268
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:01,599
it's supposed to be criminalized

269
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:05,560
so that's this is where we are at this

270
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,278
moment Al but uh uh we have some

271
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:11,479
hopes

272
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:14,078
uh in check views we said that uh we

273
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,039
should look at it differently and that's

274
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:19,559
what we push in we are not the only one

275
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:21,519
in in the EU as you know and our

276
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:25,198
first uh

277
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:27,198
highlighted idea uh idea I would say

278
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:30,159
it's not only idea because we know what

279
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:32,758
to do we have all the data we have all

280
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:36,319
the best practice how to regulate

281
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:39,639
substances that pose any risks in terms

282
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,240
of of psychotropic

283
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:45,120
effects so we said the first thing

284
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,039
should be regulating substances

285
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,959
according to their

286
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:54,399
risks whether they are legal or illegal

287
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:56,719
today uh if we look at risks uh levels

288
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,320
of alcohol and comparing it with

289
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:03,680
cannabis I think I don't have to to to

290
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,680
go into details about this

291
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:10,839
uh of course we we need to look at

292
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:13,759
preventative prevention of of the

293
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,279
effects of illegal Market we know in

294
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,639
alcohol we know in tobacco the illegal

295
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:21,720
Market would be the worse why do we

296
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,879
think that with cannabis it's it's

297
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:29,278
different that prohibition could help in

298
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:30,720
any way so of course illegal Market has

299
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:35,720
lot of

300
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:38,839
enormous problems one of them is the

301
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,839
next next

302
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:45,480
uh next

303
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:49,160
sentence uh that money flow from illicit

304
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,959
Market are actually more risky in terms

305
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:54,360
of security than drugs

306
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:57,879
itself we all know where the money goes

307
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,839
we know that it supports uh uh uh not

308
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:02,078
only Criminal activ this it supports

309
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:06,279
totalitarian States and it supports

310
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:10,120
terrorism we know it it's not not secret

311
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:13,679
so money flowing from illicit Market are

312
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,078
actually more risky to the security

313
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:18,638
which is always the the M argument

314
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:21,198
security security the security is

315
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:24,480
actually compromised but M by money

316
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:25,599
flowing from illicit Market to to any

317
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,920
kind of

318
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,920
enormous Global organized crime

319
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:36,679
of course we we know that cannabis is

320
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,879
also a substitute to more risk

321
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:41,599
Alternatives we know it we have all the

322
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,159
data positive effects of economy and

323
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,759
Public Safety of course I don't have to

324
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:49,838
talk about this one

325
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:53,440
uh and we say that actually regulated

326
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:56,000
market we have all the data regulated

327
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,720
market is better

328
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,360
tool than in prevention

329
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,798
is better tool than prohibition We Know

330
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,759
It We Know It with tobacco we have all

331
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:09,679
the data we know it with alcohol We Know

332
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:12,679
It with other substances and we already

333
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,880
seen the data now with cannabis and of

334
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:18,519
course we should mention the human

335
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,919
rights uh the the the commission uh the

336
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:23,078
the highest commissioner for human

337
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:26,759
rights last year you might have come

338
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:29,038
across with that said uh released a

339
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:33,038
report and said that the interpretation

340
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:36,720
of 1961 convention uh U pushing the

341
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:40,240
countries to to send people to to long

342
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,240
sentences life prison imprisonment and

343
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,519
executions in many countries hundreds of

344
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,599
thousand people have already been

345
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:49,480
executed uh since we started a

346
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:51,199
Prohibition since that time the the

347
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,279
Cannabis Mark illicit Market is only

348
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:57,000
growing across the world so and it says

349
00:17:54,279 --> 00:18:00,000
clearly this is again the charter of

350
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,159
human rights of the UN which we are all

351
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,919
based on so I think this is so important

352
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:08,840
to to

353
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:10,559
to uh to speak about decriminalization I

354
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:13,079
know that you're talking about science

355
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,798
you're talking about use of uh cannabis

356
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:16,960
for medical purposes but I think it's

357
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:19,839
quite important to speak about the whole

358
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,880
thing in terms of decrim because

359
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:26,639
decriminalization is one of the main

360
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:29,640
tools to actually be able to to

361
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,320
operate uh

362
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,880
so I mean I I'm not going to because I

363
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:37,200
don't have so much time I we want to

364
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:39,960
have some questions uh so what actually

365
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,480
at this moment we are allowed according

366
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,919
to the European laws if I forget the the

367
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,880
international law because internation

368
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,280
law is only blame and shame but

369
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,120
according to European law which has some

370
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:54,720
tools to to actually put sanctions on

371
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:56,798
countries they if they are in Bridge

372
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,000
with with the European law so we are

373
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:01,879
allowed to do hom growing we are allowed

374
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,679
maybe cannabis clubs that it's on the

375
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,400
edge or any kind of as we call it

376
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:10,400
delegation of homeg growing to other

377
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:15,759
person we are allowed to to to of course

378
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:19,000
to do uh medical use I mean production

379
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:21,839
and and sale for medical use strictly in

380
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,720
medical setup we actually according to

381
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:29,240
to a current European law it's not

382
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:31,079
possible to to to to have regulated

383
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:35,200
market which would be the most

384
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:38,199
beneficial uh part

385
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,919
regulation uh I'm not going to bore you

386
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,919
with all this uh legal

387
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,919
situations

388
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:52,079
um if we want to if you want to ask me

389
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:57,079
the questions I think that's that's

390
00:19:52,079 --> 00:20:00,158
complicated uh so we know that today uh

391
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:03,240
the difference is

392
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:06,799
are there I mean in in US you have

393
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:13,519
commercial Market on in different states

394
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:16,279
not not uh uh uh not uh Federal Canada

395
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:20,400
there is a federal uh Poss and and

396
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:22,399
Uruguay you have a uh you have Market

397
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,120
but it's not allowed in in European

398
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,880
Union so in European Union you have what

399
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:30,918
you

400
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:36,880
see uh most currently Germany and Mal

401
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:39,919
Malta uh introduced the laws for for um

402
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,480
possibility of accessing cannabis for

403
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,400
non-medical use but again the same

404
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,798
situation that we are facing in Czech

405
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,120
Republic trying to push the law for

406
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:54,079
Market uh that the European commission

407
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:56,199
will meet with you informally and say

408
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:59,519
informally don't use it don't use it

409
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,840
formally I did all this uh me meetings

410
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,679
but we tell you we are telling you if

411
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:07,678
you uh if you open the the market you

412
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:11,360
will be in Bridge of the of the EU law

413
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,159
and we will have to act so that's same

414
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:15,759
happened to Germany you might have

415
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:17,919
follow the the the the bottle they had

416
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,519
they wanted to open a regulated market

417
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,960
at the end they have it in some some

418
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:26,200
cities as a study so this is how we have

419
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,720
to uh to work in the current

420
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:35,600
state so I would I would like to to to

421
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:39,000
finish end with u with a sentence I know

422
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:42,199
that uh here we are not in an activist

423
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,440
meeting uh and I'm not an activist I'm a

424
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:47,798
I'm a policy maker and it took

425
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:50,640
me I will tell you seven years to come

426
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:53,200
to this conclusion since 2010 when I

427
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,320
started in my office and I was looking

428
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,640
at the data over and over and over and

429
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:02,558
over uh remembering in some some

430
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:06,559
situations such as

431
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:09,480
1998 uh the the the the the Declaration

432
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:13,639
of all heads of state of un claiming the

433
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:18,480
world be will be free of drugs 2008 and

434
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:23,840
we can see that the the the the the

435
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:26,079
drugs Market quart tripled since since

436
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:29,278
1961

437
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:32,879
prohibition is a cruel

438
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:35,880
and failing social

439
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,200
experiment we need to find other options

440
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:42,600
we need to start something else uh we

441
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:46,519
will have a ministerial conference in

442
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:51,079
Berlin in November so in a couple of

443
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:56,240
months and uh one of the outcomes we

444
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:59,798
hope will be that we will uh decide and

445
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:03,079
agree with uh number of of countries to

446
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:05,519
start the process of changing this

447
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:08,439
Council decision of European Union so

448
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:11,639
changing the European law in terms of

449
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:14,840
opening the possibility for states or

450
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:18,759
for countries for member states to to

451
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:21,839
regulate according to to their um level

452
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:25,119
of knowledge of the risks of different

453
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:29,359
substances and especially with cannabis

454
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:32,399
uh uh this will happen and I'm I'm sure

455
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:34,918
we only don't know when and how and who

456
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,919
but this will

457
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,440
happen thank

458
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:44,000

465
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:03,960
is your opinion which country country uh

466
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:08,519
uh have the best uh

467
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:12,840
regulation um regarding safety regarding

468
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:16,960
the less of use of heavy drugs less

469
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:22,918
criminal criminality in uh in this uh

470
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:26,798
meaning and um what uh think you also

471
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:30,360
about now the Germany system is uh for

472
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:34,519
your opinion good it's a how it's okay

473
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:37,079
yeah um it's a very uh complex question

474
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:39,240
of course thank you for that uh I'll

475
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:44,839
start with cannabis I think cannabis

476
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:47,919
regulation so far uh seems to be in from

477
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:50,879
my eyes and from our views when we look

478
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:53,320
at preventative measures because my role

479
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:58,679
is prevent prevention of

480
00:24:53,319 --> 00:25:00,158
addictions uh e Canada seems um because

481
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:02,759
if we look at the

482
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:05,520
data when in terms of for example

483
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:08,359
underage we're looking at a cohort of 15

484
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:12,079
to 19 year old it's dropping

485
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:15,479
down uh we know this from Holland for

486
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:18,158
example for for for decades that the

487
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,960
Cannabis coffee shops didn't didn't

488
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:23,080
raise the the problem for

489
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,960
underage

490
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:29,839
uh in terms of

491
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:32,720
all as media I would call it hard drugs

492
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:35,398
we don't call it in our field hard drugs

493
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,919
and soft drugs it's complicated to to

494
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:40,918
distinguish because it's alcohol hard

495
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,919
drug

496
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:48,799
uh well depends on what the society

497
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:51,359
wants because uh as as I said I'm

498
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:55,119
looking at at addiction problem as one

499
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:57,000
issue alcohol gambling tobacco uh all

500
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:59,798
drugs that we have to currently under

501
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,038
prohibition we also look at digital

502
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:07,038
substance digital addictions

503
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:09,440
so any any strict regulations we have

504
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:12,519
all the data any strict regulations for

505
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:15,038
example we know regulations uh with

506
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:16,759
alcohol in in North America or

507
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:21,398
Scandinavia it

508
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:24,398
works the same works with other drugs it

509
00:26:21,398 --> 00:26:27,959
does so strict regulations such as

510
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:31,278
specialized shops uh such as specialized

511
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:34,440
license for the people who s sell those

512
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:37,159
substances which can be taken away when

513
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:40,640
when these people break break the rules

514
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:42,840
for example cell under age uh it's not

515
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,919
everywhere it's it's limit in limited

516
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:49,000
places and there is strong prevention

517
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:52,799
not not advertising allowed uh high

518
00:26:49,000 --> 00:27:00,038
price uh because of excise taxs etc etc

519
00:26:52,798 --> 00:27:04,599
so this uh um kind of um bun of rules

520
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:08,919
but it has to be hand to hand with um

521
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:11,719
prevention and help so if this together

522
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:14,840
is put together that in then it works in

523
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,558
terms of uh number of problem drug users

524
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:20,959
when we look for example in injecting

525
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:24,278
drug use uh European Union comparing to

526
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:28,360
the rest of the world is better in in in

527
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:31,079
many ways yes so have lower number of of

528
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:34,439
injecting Dr uses comparing to Eastern

529
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:39,639
Europe for example Ukraine Russia or or

530
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:42,558
other places us uh I think it's because

531
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:45,679
uh we decriminalize at some point so

532
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:49,079
people were were able to access Services

533
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:51,038
we early on in in in introduced

534
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:54,000
so-called harm reduction

535
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:56,440
approach uh which doesn't push people

536
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,960
only for abstinence but uh what allow

537
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,880
people for example uh substitution

538
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,399
programs and as we know

539
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:08,559
substitution whether it's substituted in

540
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:13,079
in Market or but with doct from medical

541
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:16,759
hands uh is one of the best tools

542
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:18,199
substitution to to to the uh uh drugs

543
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:21,398
which are on the illicit Market

544
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:24,720
substitued with less risky risky uh

545
00:28:21,398 --> 00:28:26,719
drugs that actually works for example we

546
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:31,240
we're looking at the at the tobacco

547
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:34,960
epidemics now when we uh see very quick

548
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:37,720
very fast drop off of lung cancers heart

549
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,200
diseases premature death because people

550
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:43,079
switched from from smoking because the

551
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:46,000
SM the smoking the most I mean whoever

552
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:48,000
smokes cannabis I don't I'm an abstinent

553
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,880
I I don't even drink alcohol but whoever

554
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,359
smokes cannabis so I would uh I would

555
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,000
recommend to switch from smoking to any

556
00:28:53,359 --> 00:29:00,038
kind other type of use because uh the

557
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,759
the the tar that we use from from burnt

558
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:05,519
anything burnt especially the paper that

559
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:10,319
is what is killing us so we see the

560
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:13,960
substituted Market is very uh very uh

561
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:16,759
useful tool so I think so these two

562
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:20,120
things uh has to work prevention and

563
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:22,359
help and in a very strict substituted

564
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:26,239
Market with less risky drugs I me sorry

565
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:30,398
I'm uh it's very difficult to to give uh

566
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:33,480
to uh answer to to to this complex

567
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:36,359
question and you have you ask another

568
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,399
question about German ah the German the

569
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:43,158
German model of course the Germany knows

570
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:46,119
that the model is not the the best uh

571
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:52,240
they the initial draft was was much much

572
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:57,319
more complex and much more uh uh kind of

573
00:29:52,240 --> 00:30:00,000
um work through but they they they they

574
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:02,359
uh they crushed against the wall with

575
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,278
the European law so that's why we have

576
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:09,558
this meeting in in uh in Berlin uh on

577
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:12,038
the ministerial level in 17 of November

578
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:14,000
I think fantastic I I hate to cut you

579
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:17,558
off but we have we have time for one

580
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,038
more quick question right here yes hi

581
00:30:17,558 --> 00:30:23,158
when will the psycho madatory Substances

582
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:26,000
Act will go into force and can you

583
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,000
already apply for

584
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,200
licenses uh

585
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:33,319
I you asking about the time when it

586
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,519
starts yes uh so it should we aiming at

587
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:38,918
first

588
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:40,720
January of next year so few months from

589
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:44,159
now

590
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,798
uh the license system is going to be

591
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:50,640
regulated by by

592
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:52,720
bylaw so I have the paper already of the

593
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,759
bylaw written but it's not officially

594
00:30:52,720 --> 00:31:00,159
yet but uh we aiming at starting with

595
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:03,599
the whole process from of January but uh

596
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,960
we need to First discuss which uh

597
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:08,278
substances are going to be the put F

598
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,919
going to be put first in the in the list

599
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:13,960
so it's probably going to be katom uh

600
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:18,880
THC with higher uh I mean the the

601
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:23,360
products with thhc round of 1% above 3%

602
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:26,720
above 0.3% to to 1% maybe two we'll see

603
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:30,240
and uh and uh we'll see what's going to

604
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,679
happen with uh um with substances such

605
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:38,759
as HC has to it's it's a government

606
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:44,240
decision so it might actually be be

607
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:48,319
um uh practically in action uh I would

608
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:51,919
say the end of M the end of uh February

609
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:54,158
maybe March maybe April as well yes but

610
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,720
we are pushing to start as soon as

611
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,960
possible I mean the law will be there so

612
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,480
we want this to be active and we want to

613
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,720
pull all the substances from The Gray

614
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:08,880
Zone because for example katom is sold

615
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,960
as uh I'm finishing already the Grom is

616
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,278

617
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:17,159
want it so we want it

618
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:21,919
January government decision and February
