medicine and cannabis

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,039
via what we call the multi-stakeholder

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,439
approach which is represented by

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,239
medicine at cannabis europe which

21
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:55,119
is the association that uh hague set up

22
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:57,119
back into in 2019

23
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,679
and in this presentation i'll just just

24
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,679
uh go through with you

25
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:04,319
on the uh on our

26
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:07,040
the the role of national cannabis europe

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,039
our goals uh what we have accomplished

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,799
so far especially in terms of uh

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,080
political engagement

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:18,000
um and also if you're interested

31
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:21,840
you could uh be part of my sentence

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,239
so when we uh started back in 2019 and

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,280
in general when

34
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,839
when we

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,439
look for uh projects or uh ideas in

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,520
in eu affairs

37
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,359
we always look at what's uh what's the

38
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,359
status quo

39
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,959
in this case what what was the status

40
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,280
quo of

41
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,879
irregulation in terms of medicinal

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,599
cannabis

43
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:48,640
which i'm sure you're all very much

44
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,399
aware and that i would uh

45
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,719
summarize with awards which is a

46
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,359
fragmentation

47
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:58,399
i will go very quick on this as i'm sure

48
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:00,959
you're uh all aware uh medicine cannabis

49
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,640
regulations are quite different across

50
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,319
member states

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,718
so there are many states which are more

52
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,840
advanced on one part of the medicine

53
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,759
economy supply chain and others uh are

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,280
advanced in other parts of the supply

55
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,079
chain

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,159
however the european uh europe is

57
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,879
becoming on the way to become a leading

58
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:24,479
market in medicinal economies

59
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:26,560
and a lack of a new regulatory framework

60
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,759
for medicinal cannabis not only poses

61
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,719
hurdles to

62
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,719
the industry cultivation of our pharma

63
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,959
but also to the other

64
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:37,759
aspect or segment of what we call the

65
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,000
value chain uh which are for instance

66
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,359
the scientific and medical community and

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,159
the patients

68
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,160
and

69
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,199
all these segments are strictly

70
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:49,680
interlinked so if the uh if the industry

71
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:52,318
cannot develop in a smooth way then also

72
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,800
these affected so patient access to high

73
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,878
quality and safe medicines

74
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,280
so we said okay

75
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:02,479
we have this these hurdles we have this

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,479
situation there is a gap at eu level

77
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,479
representation of these

78
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:07,840
interests if we want to say photo call

79
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,000
it like that

80
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,239
how can we address that

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,800
and that's how we set up medicine

82
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,360
cannabis europe which is the only human

83
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,439
disease coalition

84
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,519
that was mission is to

85
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,759
ensure patients for access to medicine

86
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,799
cannabis in the eu

87
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:29,280
our why is of course because of the uh

88
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,879
therapeutical benefits of medicinal

89
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,799
cannabis in the application on the

90
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,399
treatment of different conditions and

91
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,799
diseases

92
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,120
but at the same time the lack of a

93
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,080
framework that can ensure that patients

94
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,519
can have

95
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,840
fair access

96
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,599
of to these medicines across europe

97
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,719
and how we approach this jointly uh with

98
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,759
the balance on the cannabis value chain

99
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,280
so

100
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,239
what do we mean by multi-stakeholder

101
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,318
approach uh it means that so

102
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,680
cannabis europe is a membership based

103
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,798
association and in our association we

104
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,599
have

105
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,438
all the the three main segments that we

106
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,438
identified of the canopy very medicinal

107
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,680
cannabis value chain

108
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:14,318
so we have industry we have the medical

109
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,280
and the scientific community and we have

110
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,879
the patients so we have a big

111
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,839
pool of patients association from

112
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,680
different

113
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,560
member states

114
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,840
which

115
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,478
we will see afterwards uh is also

116
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:31,519
what allowed us to gain the political

117
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:33,758
support uh we have now and it's also how

118
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:37,120
what we saw lacking at eu level so we

119
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,720
saw a lot of representation of uh

120
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,478
medicinal cannabis patients or a

121
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,479
coordinated representation of incidents

122
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,600
so when we start data

123
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,759
we started we had this idea of

124
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,479
multi-stakeholder approach uh different

125
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:56,479
segment of the cannabis value chain

126
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:58,879
and so okay how can we put that in

127
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,800
so we asked ourselves we want to ensure

128
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,839
patients for access to medicine cannabis

129
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,079
what do we mean what do we need to do

130
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:06,079
that

131
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,840
and we identified

132
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,800
three

133
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,918
pillars

134
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,000
one

135
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:16,719
is of course from a regulatory

136
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,478
perspective so uh ensuring that there is

137
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,360
a regulatory framework organizational

138
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,279
framework for mexican cannabis in the eu

139
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,520
we are i'm sure you're all

140
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,359
well we're aware of all the different

141
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,560
hurdles that exists

142
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,360
these are just

143
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,199
few of them of course when it comes to

144
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,199
motivational production

145
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,960
organizing standards when it comes to

146
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,439
affordability of medicines that patients

147
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,359
what patients if medicines are not

148
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,279
affordable for patients they don't they

149
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,479
won't buy them or they will resort to

150
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,839
other roots

151
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,519
to get

152
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:53,599
the treatment and the medicine they need

153
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,318
and also when it comes to uh free

154
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,720
movement of people so we have issues uh

155
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,720
well there are issues of of patients for

156
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,880
instance moving from a member states to

157
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,520
another with a completely different

158
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:09,038
approach to medicinal cannabis and maybe

159
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:11,439
a patient who was uh who legally use a

160
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:13,519
medicine and based on cannabis in one

161
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,360
member state will not be able to use it

162
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,719
legally in other member states and this

163
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,639
is also

164
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,160
another hard rules but there are many

165
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,319
more i'm sure you're aware of it

166
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,680
then we have another pillar

167
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,080
which is research research and

168
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,759
innovation one of the main hurdles

169
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,519
especially for for the medical for the

170
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,680
medicine economists

171
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,680
is the so-called lack of scientific

172
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,879
evidence

173
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,240
that is that we have and we hear hear a

174
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:44,079
lot also from policymakers

175
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,400
and so another point another pillar of

176
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,519
our advocacy is to really

177
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,758
promote

178
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,598
research innovation so european in

179
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,000
europe in europe as well as a national

180
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,839
level there are funding schemes i'm also

181
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,319
sure you're aware of that such as a rise

182
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,638
in europe who allocate funding for

183
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,759
reserve generation of specific areas

184
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,280
among which

185
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,439
health

186
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,399
and we are pushing in that direction to

187
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,839
allocate funding for medicinal cannabis

188
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,638
research

189
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,000
in different and in different ways it

190
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,240
can be

191
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,839
research projects on the application of

192
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,360
medicinal cannabis on specific

193
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,839
conditions

194
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,479
in this case well we are we are focusing

195
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:27,038
especially on conditions which are also

196
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,159
a priority in the eu

197
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:31,360
because

198
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,000
when you do advocacy uh at all levels i

199
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,120
say all i believe was at national level

200
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,959
you

201
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,800
you know what you want to say what you

202
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,359
want to convey what is your message but

203
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,439
you also need to know what the other

204
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,240
party and your interrogator is willing

205
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,918
to listen to and is really interested in

206
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,160
knowing so

207
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,598
as a first step we

208
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,520
focus on

209
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,319
in this case conditioned diseases which

210
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:59,120
are also priority in at the eu level

211
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,160
cancer rare diseases this is something

212
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,879
that

213
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,160
is already work which is ongoing at eu

214
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,240
level and

215
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,560
it's work where we see a role for

216
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,439
medicine academies and that's the route

217
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,918
we take to advocate and to try to

218
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,439
allocate research resources and funding

219
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:16,639
for medicine economy research at this

220
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,038
stage

221
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,840
and then we also had um well of course

222
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:24,318
clinical trials um

223
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:27,119
that are useful and needed to build up

224
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,000
the real evidence and then would allow

225
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,918
and first accelerate the uptake of

226
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,158
of medicine cannabis

227
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:37,120
and then we had a third pillar which if

228
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:39,519
i would uh prioritize would be the let's

229
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,360
say the foundation on which the other

230
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,320
two build

231
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,399
and it's

232
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,120
the narrative around medicinal cannabis

233
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,519
which we are seeing and i think we also

234
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,720
this was discussed in the previous uh

235
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,600
panels

236
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,560
we

237
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,360
we are seeing it developing i think uh

238
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:59,439
since we started uh three four years ago

239
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,278
uh this has already been developed in

240
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,959
the in the in the right direction but

241
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:07,600
it's not uh over so this is uh one of

242
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,359
the pillars that we uh we work on and on

243
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,159
which we started

244
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,480
with our policy maker engagement because

245
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,399
not only need a social dialogue but we

246
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,039
need a political dialogue

247
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,120
because when we started back in 2019

248
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,759
medicine economist was

249
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,639
barely in the political discussions at

250
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:28,799
the new level barely and when you do not

251
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,480
like the topics you want to advocate for

252
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,719
it's not in the agenda and you have to

253
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,320
put it in the agenda you have to push a

254
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,639
discussion on it we have to make sure

255
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,959
that the topic is

256
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:41,838
in political discussion and that's what

257
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,759
we what we did first

258
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,279
and one thing that we got in our

259
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,799
exchange with policy maker is the

260
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,759
importance of a clear distinction

261
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,519
between medical and recreational

262
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:53,120
especially at eu level

263
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,480
so that's where we focus we focus on the

264
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,799
medical side

265
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,120
we promote multi-stakeholder dialogue

266
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,679
and of course another another

267
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,000
point is not only educating

268
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,078
policy makers externally to the value

269
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
chain but also educating the segment of

270
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,679
the value chain that's also another

271
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,519
hardware that we encountered and that

272
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:13,439
were also was also mentioned by the

273
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,519
panels before is the education and

274
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,880
knowledge of ethical professionals

275
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,278
doctors nurses pharmacists which

276
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,838
which is important for which

277
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:26,399
there is a new angle that can be

278
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,920
explored

279
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,440
so these are the three pillars of our

280
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:32,958
advocacy

281
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:36,240
but it all it all bases on a let's say

282
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:38,239
a prerequisite from our side which is

283
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,360
understanding what we mean by medicinal

284
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,600
cannabis

285
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,519
and trying to have an harmonize the

286
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,399
understanding as possible of medicinal

287
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,799
cannabis and this is what uh we're

288
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,320
pushing for at the moment and this is

289
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:55,759
also one of the first uh actions that

290
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,600
the eu is starting doing uh you cannot

291
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:01,759
cannot develop a binding definition but

292
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,320
what you can do is providing and

293
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,200
suggesting a harmonized definition as

294
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,200
much as possible

295
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:14,720
so this is the bulk of our advocacy once

296
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:16,078
we had it in place we said okay

297
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,720
how

298
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:21,278
to whom we address our concerns so in

299
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,040
the eu you have three different and main

300
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,320
institutions you have the commission you

301
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:25,519
have the parliament and you have the

302
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,560
council

303
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,078
and naturally uh the the first

304
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,958
institution we went to was the

305
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:35,679
parliament why because the parliament is

306
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:38,159
meant to represent new citizens we were

307
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,679
going there with the perspective of of

308
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,439
patient with a value chain but with a

309
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:45,039
patient-centered approach which

310
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,279
resonates very well with policymakers

311
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,958
we presented the policy pledge

312
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,600
it took some time but we managed to

313
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:55,119
build some support and in the second

314
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,399
half of last year we facilitated the

315
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,959
setup of

316
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,879
a european parliament interest group of

317
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,759
medicinal families

318
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:06,320
now an interest group is an informal

319
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:08,240
group of amitis

320
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,399
meaning sorry this is the eu jargon

321
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,120
members of the european parliament which

322
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,600
are shortened amenities

323
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,919
a group of amethyst who informally

324
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,399
gathers

325
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:23,199
and focuses on a specific topic in this

326
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:27,360
case is messenger cannabis

327
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,120
we have so far 36 energies from

328
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,919
different political groups

329
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,320
and

330
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:33,278
why this is important it is important

331
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,360
because

332
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:36,720
we don't want the topic of medicine like

333
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,680
cannabis to be polarized in the

334
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,440
discussion we want it to be a broad

335
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:44,479
political support

336
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,279
and so far we have it we will uh we will

337
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,519
continue to uh to increase and to

338
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:52,799
broaden the support

339
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,839
but that's a good start and uh nmeps

340
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:58,000
represents 20 countries which out of 27

341
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,120
it's it's quite a good it's quite a good

342
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,159
number

343
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,720
um

344
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,319
now you will ask me what what how can

345
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,759
what the parliament can do what what

346
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,320
they can do to help

347
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:12,240
our cause well there are three three

348
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,240
main things that they can help us

349
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,799
one is facilitating multi-stakeholder

350
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,278
dialogue what do we mean by that it

351
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,559
means that as i said before

352
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:22,720
to put a

353
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:25,039
topic in the political discussion you

354
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,120
need to create the conditions for this

355
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:27,919
topic to be discussed

356
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,120
and

357
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:33,679
one of the conditions is to have the key

358
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,639
policy makers involved in this

359
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,000
now

360
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,480
if

361
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,320
medicine has cannabis europe just

362
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,720
reaches out to uh member states like so

363
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,320
that say that the chances of success are

364
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:51,360
much lower than if a another institution

365
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:55,199
reaches out to look for events

366
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,399
discussions front tables and so on

367
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,559
so this is a

368
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,198
a an important role and this is also

369
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,919
what helped us we will see in the inside

370
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:06,078
afterwards making the first step towards

371
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:08,159
this movie stakeholder and policymaking

372
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:11,039
discussion

373
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:13,519
then they didn't support our advocacy

374
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,958
so the department has its own tools

375
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,198
instruments to

376
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,559
push a topic towards

377
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:22,639
the commission and the other member

378
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:24,799
states so they uh they also have side uh

379
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,759
all possibilities to to advocate

380
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,838
directly and to support our our cause

381
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,958
and our

382
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:36,240
uh and then i can broaden our uh

383
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:38,559
our social dialogue and enrich a broader

384
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,240
range of audience uh that can be also

385
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:45,838
fellow mbps or their constituencies

386
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,639
uh and so on so uh these three uh these

387
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:51,440
three elements uh are very important to

388
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,680
push our goals further

389
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,160
and one example for instance is the one

390
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:58,319
of the first activities we did with them

391
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,399
was to organize uh an event in the

392
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,760
parliament it was uh last march at the

393
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,159
end of march

394
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,720
uh which uh

395
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,399
where when we feature the different uh

396
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,000
representatives from policy makers so we

397
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,240
had the parliament of course the the

398
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,120
interest group all the mps and in

399
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,959
particular two mps who

400
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,000
participated in the event we had the

401
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,799
commission

402
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,559
we had representatives from

403
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:26,479
two national authorities france and

404
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:28,719
czech republic the choice was not random

405
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,759
the choice was on purpose because at the

406
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,440
time

407
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,159
france was leading

408
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,279
the council so the member state work and

409
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:39,439
now it's czech republic so it's also

410
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:43,120
through these opportunities we also

411
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,720
create a network at eu level with the

412
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,399
member states

413
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,320
and then we have representatives from

414
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,198
the medicine cannabis value chain which

415
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,360
also are members of medicinal cannabis

416
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:56,240
europe so we have our vice president

417
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,839
jacqueline potratz uh for mamaka

418
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,240
from the patient association dr

419
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:03,279
babakbaban who is one of our scientific

420
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,839
advisory board members and we have uh

421
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:10,159
finance who is from tiny christianity

422
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,160
group who is also part of our board

423
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,320
so this is uh our advocacy at eu level

424
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,320
it may be a little bit different from a

425
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,839
more technical advocacy but the

426
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,480
technical and what we call the so

427
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,519
more political advocacy both are

428
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,159
important to push a topic forward

429
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,078
because at the end is the

430
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:33,679
to say is the political

431
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,519
the more political level we give the

432
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,919
directions to the technical levels

433
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,839
that's not that that's how it goes so

434
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,838
there needs to be a push from both sides

435
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:44,719
and well

436
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,720
uh

437
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,199
as i said can basically cannabis europe

438
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,278
is a membership based association so we

439
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,399
invite uh and we invite everybody who is

440
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,240
interested in

441
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,839
in

442
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,600
participating in medicine cannabis

443
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,639
europe um

444
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,600
to to reach out to me uh we can we

445
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,720
welcome every segment on value chain so

446
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,480

medicinal doctors

448
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:15,120
and patient associations as well

449
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,799
and well just a wrap-up of what we do uh

450
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,879
of course we contribute for raising

451
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,639
awareness and shaping the debate on

452
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,360
medicine economies

453
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,038
also with policy makers patients and and

454
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,119
public

455
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:28,960
of course being active in brussels and

456
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,798
having a food in brussels allows us to

457
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,480
have intelligence on what's going on

458
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:38,240
when it comes to cannabis in the eu

459
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:41,200
uh we are a part of a good network with

460
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:45,440
with patients with the medical community

461
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,440
and with other eu associations as well

462
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,678
and of course our final goal and

463
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:54,400
ultimate goal is to shape the policy

464
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,400
developments on medicinal cannabis

465
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,200

the

492
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:31,359
path and the work with the political

493
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,640
level of medicine at cannabis it's at an

494
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:34,399
early stage

495
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,320
what we are now focusing on and also

496
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,240
what we are focusing on via the mpps and

497
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,839
with the meps is on

498
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,679
as i said building this political

499
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,918
discussion making sure that this is

500
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:49,360
something that is discussed

501
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:53,120
um and in the in currently we also

502
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:55,199
following that the developments uh more

503
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:58,000
from a regulatory perspective uh

504
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,400
european uh european medicine agency

505
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,159
this is something that has been going on

506
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,720
um

507
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,559
yes of course the current the current

508
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,759
topics are very important and are

509
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:09,839
technology but i'm not talking about

510
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,919
mechanical taking over many other topics

511
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:12,720
also other topics i'm working on

512
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,200
but

513
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,120
let's say that the early stage of of the

514
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,558
of the discussion of medicine cannabis

515
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:20,399
allows us

516
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,798
still to have room for

517
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,120
to do what we what we have to do at this

518
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:25,119
stage

519
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,960
hello

520
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,200
i have a question what is your personal

521
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,720
view on extracts

522
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,200
and is

523
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,360
shared between flower and extracts to

524
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,038
what is regulatory

525
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:42,079
view on

526
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:47,000
what the

527
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:47,000
medical cannabis would be only should be

528
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,309
[Music]

529
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:05,440
now the commission has been uh

530
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,360
i was wrapped up and published

531
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,880
a cloud of glossary where they also put

532
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:12,479
down all the different definitions

533
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,440
including extracts

534
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,480
uh if interested i can share with you

535
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,080
um

536
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,079
but this is where we are at this stage

537
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,200
so

538
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,919
what is your current this

539
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,000
like advisors to regulators this is your

540
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:36,559
current review on

541
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,640
this issue cutting flowers and textures

542
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,480
are you doing something in this area

543
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,520
like trials

544
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,798
with overall thinking the visionary

545
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:48,400
are you doing any research on this

546
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:50,879
uh we are doing partially with our

547
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,159
scientific advisory board but that is

548
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,640
more on the rni side it's more on the

549
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,919
research and innovation side okay thank

550
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,640
you not on the policy regulator

551
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,559
and before we come to an end um let me

552
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,440
please ask you a question

553
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:07,038
um

554
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,679
because

555
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:11,599
when we look on the international laws

556
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,200
it comes to the point that any country

557
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,038
uh having a

558
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,159
medical cannabis program actually needs

559
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:21,038
a cannabis agency how many european uau

560
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,919
countries uh you deal with have a kind

561
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:27,279
of a cannabis agency

562
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:30,320
sorry again how many eu countries have a

563
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:32,639
cannabis agency as a basic for medicinal

564
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:35,200
cannabis so far

565
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,320
not many not many

566
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,319
because

567
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:40,399
because member states are applying the

568
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:43,439
topic of economics in a different way

569
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,280
you will have member states which are

570
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,400
implementing the so-called pilot

571
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:49,279
programs

572
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,679
we have france for instance we had uh

573
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:53,200
ireland we had denmark

574
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,880
which is a completely different approach

575
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,400
that for instance

576
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,280
czech republic

577
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,960
which has a drug coordinator or

578
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,519
the netherlands which has an agents and

579
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,519
so on so

580
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:09,359
also the way member states are

581
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,119
regulative medicine of the

582
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,918
way the structure the governance of

583
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:15,678
messaging economics in member states is

584
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,400
structured is different

585
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,200
so that of course contributes but this

586
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,200
is something that at eu level

587
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,038
the eu has not the competence to tell

588
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,120
member states

589
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:30,079
so let me please ask an additional

590
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,199
question that due to the u.n treaty

591
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:33,038
on

592
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,440
drugs

593
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:38,000
any country that

594
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,480
has a medical collapse program has to

595
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,119
have a caliber agency just as an open

596
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,519
agency so how come that country is

597
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:48,000
implementing a medical cannabis program

598
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:51,519
do not open up canonization because i

599
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,159
remember in germany before anything was

600
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:56,480
dealt with medical cannabis here we had

601
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,200
to open up the cannabis agency that was

602
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,120
always a delay was always the reason

603
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,319
that we do not have this agency on

604
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:07,199
federal or general level so uh how come

605
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:09,439
that countries implemented pro programs

606
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,360
just about such a thing

607
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,558
that's a question i cannot i cannot

608
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,278
answer but i think there are also

609
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:17,359
like

610
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:19,519
there are always sideways on which you

611
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:21,439
can you can deal with a topic like

612
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:22,480
amazing cannabis okay i've created a

613
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,519
special

614
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,640
program

615
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,000
only a

616
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,520
trial program and then if it works then

617
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,640
we can see how to move forward that's

618
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:32,639
for instance the approach of

619
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,599
thank you very much

620
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:45,429
[Applause]

621
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,798
