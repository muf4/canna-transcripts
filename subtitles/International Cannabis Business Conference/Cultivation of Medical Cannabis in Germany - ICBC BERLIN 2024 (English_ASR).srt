1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,919
right so you think that you've gotten a

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,039
legalization and the people who hate

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:08,599
cannabis still hate cannabis and they

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,599
still work against cannabis and they

5
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:13,280
still want to stop it even though you

6
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:16,359
keep having common sense and if listen

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:18,198
if common sense and science were

8
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:19,279
accepted by politicians we would all

9
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:22,279
have fewer

10
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,719

we've been focusing on for the past

35
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:58,879
almost 10 years every vertical and um

36

also uh Emerging Markets such as Europe

37
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,839
and other countries so this panel is

38
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,640
very interesting because it's actually

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,840

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,919
know we're we're um representing here

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,360

42
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:18,159
cultivation to distribution to

91
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,960
value chain excluding the

92
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:33,680
cultivation yes my name is Thomas shaton

93
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,879
CEO from 420 Pharma I'm in the industry

94
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,959

96
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:46,038
wholesaler here across Europe in 2022 uh

97
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,879
the company Cur Leaf uh stepped in as an

98
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:50,240
investor in our company and we are happy

99
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,478
to discover whatever is in front of us

100
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,560
after legalization here in Germany and

101
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:57,159
happy to be on this panel here thank you

102
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,839
very good so let me ask like a quick

103
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,080
quick clarification CU I saw you were

104
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:06,000
you know kind of looking at me like okay

105
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:08,439
so uh kativa distributor now also you

106
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,079
importer and also exporter yes I heard

107
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:13,560
that you're uh made a new partnership

108
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:16,038
for distribution to towards Czech

109
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,879
Republic correct so let me ask a

110
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:19,120
question so if you understand it

111
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:20,719
correctly this is how I actually have

112
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,280
been studying it for several years

113
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,560
following your work um Can sativa

114
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:28,799
distributes the medical flow produced by

115
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,959
the three uh cultivation you know

116
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,520
companies right authorized but at the

117
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:37,279
same time deman as he said um is

118
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:40,879
actually uh covering the entire supply

119
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:43,079
chain up to delivery so where's the

120
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:47,159
mismatch there I I I think it's it's a

121
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:50,399
great question and it's also let's say a

122
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:53,240
important question right now um be due

123
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,239
to the new regulation because what

124
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:59,038
you've mentioned is totally correct over

125
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:01,120
the last years we on behalf of the bay

126
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,599
farms so the the German Authority

127
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,120
distributed the locally grown medical

128
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,919
cannabis into the pharmacies 100%

129
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,680
correct that's one vertical of our work

130
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:13,680
in addition to that we import um other

131
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,319
products we have own Brands and also

132
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,319
have a wholesale business line so that's

133
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:20,160
a little bit the Kiva perspective and as

134
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,080
of this new change and I'm very sure

135
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,520
that we're covering this topic today in

136
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,359
our our panel there will be a certain

137
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:30,159
change because there will be not only

138
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,400
deman but potentially further licensed

139
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,120
producers in the future and obviously

140
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:38,879
with this new framework this products

141
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,478
are not required to be pumped through

142
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,399
the canera system because it's not part

143
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:45,719
of this tender of this cultivation

144
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:47,799
tender and also our distribution

145
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,240
agreement that we also won in a in in a

146
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,560
tender so we are really at a point where

147
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,879
caner canera is still the exclusive

148
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,240
partner of the governmental Authority on

149
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:01,319
the distribution of domestically grown

150
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,639
medical cannabis but only to the extent

151
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:06,919
of the existing contract and the

152
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:10,680
existing let's say old volumes and now

153
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:14,079
uh we have this change right until 2026

154
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,639
correct uh so it started in

155
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,439
2021 the first deliveries and it's a

156
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,800
five years or four years contract and

157
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:23,560
the last um product I think that was

158
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,520
Aurora and also deman in 2022 was

159
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:32,120
connected so 20 uh uh six should be

160
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:34,038
correct given that there is no change on

161
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,478
this overall framework and contract

162
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:37,878
because this is also something that

163
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:40,240
needs to be elaborated and to be worked

164
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:42,639
on will there be a change on this

165
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,560
contract that maybe deman has with the

166
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,158
authorities and also we have with the

167
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,720
authorities and that's probably nothing

168
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:51,000
that we can disclose or discuss publicly

169
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,120
right now okay but let's let's talk

170
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
about uh you know this this new there's

171
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,959
a couple of uh new situations here right

172
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,038
the uh legalization of adult you

173
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:03,799
and the

174
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,719
liberalization of medical cannabis now

175
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,360
the liberalization of medical cannabis

176
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,199
we're talking about the lifting of the

177
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,759
restrictions of production for each one

178
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:15,720
of the three cultivators and at the same

179
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:19,840
time also potentially unlimited

180
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:22,120
licenses someone says even up to 100 so

181
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:25,719
let's talk about the pros and cons you

182
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:29,000
know coming from uh the us we all uh are

183
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,479
used to you know think limited license

184
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,559
Market

185
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,679
is better than unlimited license market

186
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:38,359
so and plus at the same time there's

187
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,439
also the legalization of the adult use

188
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,440
which obviously you know it's not really

189
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,240
how we're thinking about it it's the

190
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:48,640
Cannabis Club Social Clubs and

191
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,000
potentially if when there will be you

192
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,559
know commercialization of adult use

193
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,639
probably the license authorizations to

194
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:59,958
cultivate um adult use will be given to

195
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:03,559
the medical cannabis cultivators all

196
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:06,000
right so pros and cons yeah I mean let

197
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:08,838
me uh maybe we took we take a look back

198
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,600
into history so if we remember the first

199
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:14,560
ICBC in 2017 there was the tender uh

200
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,519
everything the procedures were starting

201
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:19,439
and uh I remember 18 19 companies were

202
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,600
preparing for the application for the

203
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,720
tender lots of Consultants lawyers

204
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,879
companies coming here it was like a

205
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,639
green Rush here by that time in in in

206
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:34,039
Berlin um and um yeah that was a big

207
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:36,958
thing uh and everyone wanted to do that

208
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:39,639
so there were these restrictions to 10

209
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,759
tons for four years and we were just

210
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:44,078
talking about that Wen these

211
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,559
restrictions in time by that place and

212
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:47,719
we would have the same situation like

213
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:50,919
now without restriction anyone would

214
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,920
have been able to apply for a license if

215
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:56,958
the pharmaceutical grates were fulfilled

216
00:09:53,919 --> 00:10:00,519
um imagine that uh we would have 10 15

217
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:03,359
20 30 facilities already here in Germany

218
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:05,919
producing locally but that didn't happen

219
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,800
so the Restriction were in place uh and

220
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:11,240
probably for the market development that

221
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:12,879
was the right decision for for that time

222
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,039
uh but then the federal elections came

223
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:18,919
and the Liberal Party the fdp uh they

224
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:21,559
were demanding that these restrictions

225
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:24,120
should be lifted uh and V chinburg

226
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:27,879
always said Germany has to become the

227
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,919
export um Nation the export world record

228
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:31,679
championship for medical can

229
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:35,319
and everyone said oh that's strange

230
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:39,159
that's a brave brave calling and yeah

231
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,278
now it it came yeah no one really um it

232
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:43,639
was at the last moment in November no

233
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:46,439
one really expected that lifted uh that

234
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:48,600
these restrictions were lifted because

235
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,800
it wasn't really in the debate but um

236
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,720
they did a good Lobby work here

237
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:56,039
these these guys so now we have the

238
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,320
situation indeed there is no restriction

239
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:02,679
whatsoever not on product quantity not

240
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,839
on numbers of facilities uh nothing when

241
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:06,879
you can produce cannabis to

242
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:09,959
pharmaceutical standards you can produce

243
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:13,480
it in in Germany you can apply and um

244
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:15,078
you will the the um authorization will

245
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,480
will have to be granted to your to your

246
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:19,479
company um exactly how many companies do

247
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,278
you think they're going to they're going

248
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,879
to start applying that's the big

249
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:26,480
question because we are not in the same

250
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:28,439
situation as 171 18 um companies and

251
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,600
people were prepared their money was

252
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,800
there uh the um North American companies

253
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,800
they were ready for expansion Going

254
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:39,359
Global going Europe um and this attitude

255
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:41,679
is not there anymore there were several

256
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,399
crisises the Cannabis Market in the US

257
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:47,199
still in the in in a crisis isn't it do

258
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,919
you think so the the the uh

259
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,320
funders of uh you know this new

260
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,120
cultivation facility would come from

261
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,920
North America or not like you know

262
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,278
Europe or hard to tell hard to tell

263
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:58,639
because you have to keep one thing in

264
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:00,519
mind uh there's this article 21 of the

265
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,919
single convention mention saying

266
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,919
basically and in Canada applies that

267
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:07,360
saying basically the the more you

268
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:10,078
produce domestically the less you can

269
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,879
import cor so in the mid to long run in

270
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:15,239
the next three to five years if de and

271
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:18,519
aova taway ramp up their production from

272
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:21,240
to 60 kilo 60 tons we have imported 30

273
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:24,679
tons now so what the balance will be

274
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,519
from the demand uh the local demand for

275
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:28,559
for medical cannabis and the local

276
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,799
production we will see how that will

277
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,239
will unfold

278
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:35,639
so so once once uh you know domestic

279
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,000
production will just you know increase

280
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,120
and new players will come online of

281
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,360
course the silon Convention as you said

282
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,000
says that if there's enough production

283
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,600
then you don't have you can block the

284
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,679
Importer so like what would be the

285
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,920
consequences for example for all of this

286
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:55,799
uh producers in other countries such as

287
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:58,120
uh you know Portugal Macedonia Colombia

288
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:01,439
aiming at you know already probably

289
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,399
selling to Germany would I be just not

290
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,279
not be able to sell any more into the

291
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:08,159
country

292
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:10,879
yes quite clear you heard that but but

293
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,439
but but wait Kai um there is one crucial

294
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,958
thing when it comes to medical cannabis

295
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,839
from my perspective so um and five years

296
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,399
ago where the whole business started

297
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,360
here in in in Germany or in Europe

298
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,519
particularly um we thought okay there

299
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,560
are so many facilities we can buy

300
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:26,000
everywhere this is the lowest problem

301
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:28,399
this is not the bottleneck then we were

302
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,559
into the business and discovered wow

303
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,919
it's not very very easy to grow cannabis

304
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,078
on the medical grade month by month week

305
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:36,799
by week do Harvest all two weeks and

306
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:40,078
deliver the same product in the same

307
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:42,159
range of of parameters so it's not like

308
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,278
easy putting uh money on the table

309
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,480
buying a facility starting the grow

310
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:49,559
maybe in three years this will be the

311
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,920
first productive grow when you start

312
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:54,479
right now so it's not like bam and you

313
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,278
have the facility ready and if the the

314
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,639
process change and the value change are

315
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:00,799
already established I wouldn't change my

316
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,959
Supply just because there is a new one

317
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,799
because I'm so related to the quality

318
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:08,679
and the consistency of this processes so

319
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:10,359
I think um Now new suppliers in Germany

320
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:11,919
coming to the market to run growth

321
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,519
facilities will have a very hard

322
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,958
standing when it comes to the economics

323
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,839
at the beginning 100% I I can just

324
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:20,319
confirm that I mean we know how long it

325
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,880
has taken up to run the facility Well

326
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,879
and we're still optimizing everything

327
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:26,720
every day um so to get a GMP facility to

328
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,480
get the GMP certificate which you need

329
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,519
in the European Union in order to

330
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,278
produce medic cannabis it is uh quite a

331
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,720
long

332
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:38,360
run and maybe I I know kai you you have

333
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,839
this opinion from a legal perspective

334
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,039
just like really from the business

335
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,000
perspective we have established

336
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:46,240
International Supply chains we have

337
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,320
great products brought to the market and

338
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,320
we have lowcost products we have high

339
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,720
quality products and in general I would

340
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,920
say more licensed producers also

341
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,320
domestically could lead to further

342
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:01,078
competition which is generally good for

343
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,920
the patients for the whole system um

344
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:06,198
however uh if I would place my bet I

345
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:09,198
would kind of disagree I think there

346
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:11,159
will be a future for imports um and

347
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:13,519
International Supply chains and we'll

348
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:16,360
figure a way out over the next few years

349
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,560
how this will look like but I also agree

350
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,919
with with you philli that those that

351
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:23,439
have like Head Start and have existing

352
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:25,879
cultiv cultivation sites domestically

353
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,040
established that they will definitely

354
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:30,600
play a role in the future um and the key

355
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,759
question is will there be further

356
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,879
significant funds for those let's say up

357
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,480
to 100 potentially additional

358
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,399
cultivators and maybe to add one more

359
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,199
point I think the the only important

360
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,278
question now is the as Peter mentioned

361
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:44,679
the the column two you know the second

362
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:46,439
part of the law if that will come then

363
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:48,559
everything for this recreational Market

364
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,560
has to be grown in Germany obviously I

365
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,799
mean I think we in a good position for

366
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,518
that as well and then obviously more

367
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,559
competitors may enter the market because

368
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:58,360
it has to be grown domestically the

369
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,239
question is then what will be the legal

370
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,919
frame or regulatory framework to B

371
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,360
better said uh which needs to be um

372
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:09,278
accomplished is that going to be also

373
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,399
for uh by the way for adult use heard um

374
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:14,278
in the future potentially when

375
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,440
commercialization is allowed still in

376
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:19,159
indoors

377
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:22,000
GMP now due to the international

378
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:24,198
regulations if the model projects come

379
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,879
uh the supply for the model products

380
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:30,120
have to be cultivated in Germany uh and

381
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:32,120
if you plan now to establish your own

382
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,759
facility uh your own cultivation

383
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,198
facility you in a better position to

384
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:39,240
supply also the model projects which are

385
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:40,599
coming but to answer your question I

386
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,680
think it really depends if you still

387
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,959
need ugp we we don't know yet we know

388
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,599
that's the highest standard we have in

389
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:51,439
gcp probably at least GP is a standard

390
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,000
then e GMP maybe somewhere between food

391
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,800
and GMP we we don't know yet but we

392
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,839
obviously say Okay stick to GMP you know

393
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,639
what you have and you have a good

394
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:04,000
quality in that okay so and now about

395
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,400
the the adult use uh so how do you see

396
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,640
this coming I mean I'm sure that the

397
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,959
everybody in you know at this conference

398
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,199
wants to know about potential

399
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,640
consequences of this Cann ofes clubs

400
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,600
they are social clubs they're kind of

401
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,240
different from the ones in Spain

402
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:24,119
obviously because they're totally legal

403
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,880
uh 500 Max uh members we don't know

404
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:29,439
which location uh by the way the member

405
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,480
has to drive right to the but they can

406
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,960
actually carry it out I don't know what

407
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:37,200
would be the consequences for you know

408
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,919
uh um the medical side and also as a as

409
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,080
a let's say as a patient as a user would

410
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,480
it be cheaper or more you know uh

411
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:48,798
economic or or easier for me to to get

412
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:52,640
my cannabis as a medical patient or as a

413
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,639
um you know member of the of the

414
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:58,480
clubs yeah maybe I I kick it off thanks

415
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,120
Thomas so um first of all the only

416
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,480
commercial commercially addressable

417
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:05,239
Market is the medical Market as of now

418
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,960
so the whole can Social Club system it's

419
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,720
for non-commercial purposes that's

420
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,440
important to understand and what would

421
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,759
be the Dynamics from our perspective

422
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,159
first of all we had the rescheduling of

423
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:19,079
cannabis S A nonactic and I think all of

424
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:21,520
us here and the panel saw over the last

425
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:24,199
two weeks probably significant impact in

426
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:27,240
our sales and revenue which is great so

427
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:30,960
we see that there is a seamless easy

428
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:33,359
patient Journey that those patients get

429
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,360
those products get cannabis that's like

430
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:38,519
very important and the the key question

431
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:40,519
is will there be in the future people

432
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:43,200
going into self therapy through those

433
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:47,639
cannabis social clubs for example or

434
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:50,519
will those patients go to like reliable

435
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,038
high quality established Supply chains

436
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:55,839
and also products that's something that

437
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:58,440
we will see however my opinion is if it

438
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,079
is a easy patient Journey which is

439
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,360
possible

440
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:04,399
this commercial addressable Market is

441
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:08,038
the one that will probably have a

442
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,919
significant impact um and I believe that

443
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:13,200
when it comes to the recreational adult

444
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:16,919
use system we need to wait a little bit

445
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,840
on actually the pillar two of the um uh

446
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:22,559
yeah law um that might come over the

447
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:24,798
next few years and this will be probably

448
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,759
from the commercial perspective the one

449
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,720
uh that might have more impact on the

450
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:31,319
overall system than the the cannabis

451
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,400
Social Clubs right we will see what

452
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:35,439
happens sorry yeah maybe to add to your

453
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,640
question regarding pricing and what does

454
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,519
it mean for the End customer patient

455
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,080
consumer in the end I mean right now you

456
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,400
go to the pharmacy and you pay the same

457
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:45,399
price as on the black market so already

458
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,120
right now and as Ben said the journey is

459
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,120
quite simple already 7 to 10 in the

460
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:53,279
pharmacy you can get a gram of cannabis

461
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:55,479
so I think um for a social club to get

462
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:59,480
to that level and to accomplish that

463
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:03,319
quality It's a Long Way um to have

464
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:05,960
yeah enough funds to really realize that

465
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:07,720
right so well by the way do you are you

466
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,960
do you know how much is going to be the

467
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,558
cost uh the cost per gram or you know

468
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,000
how much they're going to have to pay

469
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:17,158
the the members of the clubs it's

470
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,519
differing depending on the club what

471
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:22,120
kind of of style they they are have we

472
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:26,000
we are seeing clubs that would require a

473
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:29,000
yearly fee of 3,000 4,000 we see clubs

474
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,400
that is a fee like 500 so this is very

475
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
very uh different but when it comes to a

476
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,759
market question how will this affect at

477
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,359
the long run um the market who will

478
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:42,400
deliver the most convenient process to a

479
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:44,479
customer SLP patient will do the run

480
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,880
because um even if I would be a

481
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,038
recreational uh uh user for example but

482
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,840
my customer journey is much more easy to

483
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:53,879
get it over a pharmacy because they do

484
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,279
delivery for example door too and the

485
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,360
recreational or my cannabis club is 20

486
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:01,000
kilometers away and I have to go there

487
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:03,719
um I will do this maybe one or two times

488
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,159
and then I will say uh I go for the

489
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,679
Amazon concept I just click and I get it

490
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,720
in front of my door so basically there

491
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:13,798
will be market for everyone recreational

492
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,919
medical for example if we just see we

493
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:18,798
invited a lot of rotary clubs a lot of

494
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,278
Lions Clubs into our facility just to

495
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:23,798
show how cannabis is produced how the

496
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:26,000
variety of medical cannabis uh is is

497
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:28,839
shown to people who use this as as a

498
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,839
medical treatment and they are really

499
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:34,000
apologizing after this oh we never know

500
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,639
that we just thought that this is just

501
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,880
the joint and nothing more so you see

502
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,679
even those kind of customer groups in

503
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,840
the future will grow because more and

504
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:45,480
more people are getting rid of their

505
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:47,038
fears and this big stigma of narcotic is

506
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,120
gone here in Germany and I think this is

507
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,679
the biggest Market booster in total and

508
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,719
at the end convenience will do the

509
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:54,200
business and run yeah convenience

510
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,278
actually I would like to talk about

511
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:59,038
convenience in the medical Market okay

512
00:21:56,278 --> 00:22:02,119
and this uh declassification at this

513
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:04,679
point I think that maybe on a side note

514
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:07,239
this adult use my help for the stigma

515
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:09,038
thing so that more actually patients

516
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,400
more people you know can actually get to

517
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:12,679
you know think that I'm going to use

518
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,880
cannabis but the declassification so

519
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:19,159
actually in Germany um as a patient the

520
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,120
situation was already pretty comfortable

521
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:25,039
because online clinics all you had to do

522
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:28,119
was just the first visit right the first

523
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:30,079
visit in person with the doctor and then

524
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:34,000
everything else could be done online and

525
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:35,558
also delivered Amazon style uh home uh

526
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,960
prices are you know pretty good

527
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:38,918
obviously now with the de classification

528
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,440
what

529
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:42,759
happens uh you can do everything online

530
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,240
what are the you know it's not more

531
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:47,359
narcotic so they say it's going to be

532
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,159
easier also for prescriptions but what

533
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:51,879
does it mean uh that you know the

534
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,360
process is going to be easier also for

535
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,559
doctors and patients so first of all I

536
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:59,079
think we can all agree on that one um

537
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:02,639
the most biggest workload for us for

538
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:04,918
example was the B Farm communication and

539
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,400
all the documentation you have to

540
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:10,759
deliver week by week uh two two numbers

541
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,519
after the comma and all that stuff um

542
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:15,798
and this is gone by now immediately

543
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:19,079
which makes us a lot of easier just

544
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:21,558
doing the processes internally plus uh

545
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:23,879
the most crucial thing for the industry

546
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:26,639
is really getting rid of the stigma so

547
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,320
it was really categorized as a narcotic

548
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,440
and in the media it was dealed as the

549
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:36,079
worst narcotic ever poison poison

550
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:38,440
invented on this planet and um this is

551
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:41,558
gone now and you see a lot of doctors

552
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,720
also they were so scared of applying for

553
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:47,119
a narcotic prescription because the

554
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,798
process is not that hard to get one but

555
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:50,038
of course then you are monitored a lot

556
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:51,679
of doctors said I don't want to be

557
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:53,960
monitored and I don't want to have all

558
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,278
this work just for I don't know € 10 so

559
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,120
I'm out of it and with this gun they

560
00:23:56,278 --> 00:24:01,519
have a different approach towards it

561
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:03,319
because they are not so focused anymore

562
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:05,480
with with this narcotic stuff and it's

563
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:07,599
not a last line therapy anymore so

564
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,640
previously as a narcotic you could only

565
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:12,079
use it as a last line therapy like

566
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,759
morphine and so on and so forth so now

567
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,759
it can be really used like eoan yeah so

568
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:18,798
this is very important actually because

569
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:22,798
it's part of the medical Market which is

570
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:24,839
a great Market because you tap into a a

571
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:27,000
huge Market potentially can be also

572
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:29,199
covered by the healthcare system so this

573
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,359
is the Pharma world right

574
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:35,558
uh which is kind of new for many of us

575
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:37,639
um but yeah so let's let's for example

576
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:39,480
now you just said something new that I

577
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,720
didn't know about the the narcotic

578
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:45,200
license uh doctors have to uh get a

579
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,880
narcotic license in order to not not

580
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,360
really a license so there are two types

581
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,799
of prescription there is a blue one

582
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:52,719
which is the regular one and the yellow

583
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:55,079
one which is the narcotic stuff and for

584
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,798
that you have to apply at B Farm you

585
00:24:55,079 --> 00:25:00,558
have to send your uh diploma as a doctor

586
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:03,879
to the B then fill out a paper and then

587
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:05,839
you get a bunch of prescription send it

588
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,640
to your uh doctor's place and then you

589
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:11,319
can use this so you have to really apply

590
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:13,559
for that okay so how do we grow the the

591
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:15,720
market of doctors how do we grow the

592
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:17,639
numbers of doctors and therefore also

593
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:21,399
the prescription so something that I

594
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:23,759
actually have um dived into uh for the

595
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:26,879
Cannabis Medical Market is the fact that

596
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,599
uh you know sometimes it's not patient

597
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,679
consumer driven but it's doctor doctors

598
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:33,759
driven right differently from the

599
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:38,320
recreational adult use market so how do

600
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:41,000
you engage doctors in to to learn how to

601
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:43,678
prescribe to believe in it and then it's

602
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,278
going to actually be become a job for

603
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,038
the doctor because I've actually studied

604
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:51,278
this uh uh there's going to be

605
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:53,679
follow-ups and you know time required by

606
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:55,278
by the doctor and therefore he obviously

607
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,519
wants to get paid and then there's

608
00:25:55,278 --> 00:26:00,759
liabilities to that so the training the

609
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:03,119
the the payment you know the rewards for

610
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:05,640
the doctors and the Health Care System

611
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,439
you know when when patients can actually

612
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,440
take advantage of the Health Care system

613
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,000
or not so uh I studied this in a in a

614
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,798
few countries in Europe like Italy for

615
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,398
example is completely Pharma so and

616
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:18,759
there's actually a certain number of

617
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:20,439
pathologies that are accepted you know

618
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:22,278
by the Health Care System then it goes

619
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,200
region by region of course but also

620
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:27,278
depends doctor by doctor if it's

621
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,278
Specialist or not a special generalist

622
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:33,960
or uh uh in a hospital so I would like

623
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:36,319
to know uh as a you know how how do you

624
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:39,038
how can patients you know get their

625
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:42,678
cannabis covered and how our clinics you

626
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:44,119
know uh benefiting from such a thing

627
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:46,360
yeah so what you're talking is a

628
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:47,678
reimbursement part uh which is still

629
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:49,199
difficult in Germany because it's still

630
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,240
a last line therapy in terms of

631
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,440
reimbursement we got to differentiate

632
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,839
between the narcotic and the

633
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,120
reimbursement part so cannabis can be

634
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:59,759
prescribed to anyone right now on a

635
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,479
script as as Thomas said um but you got

636
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,798
to pay it out of pocket if you want a

637
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,480
reimbursement it's a lengthy process you

638
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:08,960
got to prove that you have tried every

639
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:12,240
other therapy first and then even then

640
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:15,960
uh often um it's rejected because often

641
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:19,399
they say there's not enough evidence um

642
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,600
to really um do the reimbursement so I

643
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:23,678
think this doesn't change right now this

644
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,278
won't change very fast in the future

645
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,440
there are some things going on where

646
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:31,240
they try to EAS it uh for some medical

647
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,278
professionals um but it's a it's a

648
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:37,159
lengthy process and those patients who

649
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:39,960
want and need a reimbursement uh will

650
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:43,679
need to continue to fight for that but

651
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,519
with a with a price of 7 to 89 per gram

652
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,278
uh the self-pay don't really look for

653
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,960
reimbursement anymore they pay it out of

654
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:52,200
pocket voluntarily and never apply for

655
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,440
reimbursement so this is only a problem

656
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,840
for real people who really need medicine

657
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,360
and who really need the support of the

658
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:01,558
public health insurance and maybe just

659
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:04,678
adding some more color on how the market

660
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:06,519
looks like so in the past so let's say

661
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:10,000
last and the year before we were talking

662
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:12,798
about maybe 50% self payers 50% patients

663
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,278
under statu Health uh coverage now we

664
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:18,558
are probably rather talking about 60

665
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:21,759
maybe 70% self- payers so that's that's

666
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:25,278
one important impact to the market um

667
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:27,319
and we see that I mean each doctor could

668
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:29,599
prescribe cannabis I mean not dentists

669
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:33,000
not vets obviously but generally each

670
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:35,558
doctor we see I know 20 plus tele medine

671
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,240
providers right now that are also

672
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:41,558
offering their service um some very

673
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,440
bullish um and we see some especially

674
00:28:41,558 --> 00:28:46,759
pain specialists that are really

675
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:49,519
focusing on cannabis as a therapy option

676
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:52,000
and because you ask how to like educate

677
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:54,720
them how to train them it's like for me

678
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,640
the the key topic right now is

679
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,480
destigmatization not a narcotic

680
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,679
prescription anymore it really sounds so

681
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,640
silly and so easy but that's like really

682
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:06,720
really a um key and door opener and then

683
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,038
second education and this means for

684
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,240
example interface to product uh

685
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,558
information systems and so on and

686
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,038
different companies have different

687
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:17,879
solutions but that those doctors really

688
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:21,158
have the chance to get transparency of

689
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:24,519
400 plus flowers in the market of I

690
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:27,519
don't know 200 150 extracts in the

691
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:30,679
market so it's getting complex there and

692
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:32,640
uh at the same same time um it's still a

693
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:35,360
quite patient driven Market especially

694
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,759
in the flowers market so we still have

695
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:42,398
the challenge as a company that we

696
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:44,398
cannot or very limited address patients

697
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:46,918
with marketing with information so we

698
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:48,918
always need to go to the doctor or the

699
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:51,080
pharmacist to somehow get the message

700
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:52,679
out in the market so is it going to

701
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:54,839
change anything about the marketing

702
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:57,480
advertising or at least education of the

703
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:59,678
patients with this uh the scheduling yes

704
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,720
before that was a criminal offense to

705
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:05,080
advertise for medical cannabis uh

706
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:07,880
paragraph 14 paragraph 5 of the narcotic

707
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:09,678
act and now it will be in the uh in in

708
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,240
another act but it will be only a fine

709
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:16,080
and not a criminal offense anymore so

710
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,880
you can do some more before so from a

711
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,480
business perspective you could kind of

712
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,440
assess what is the cost for a certain

713
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,079
activity but but still we are talking

714
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,480
about quite significant fines and

715
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:29,439
significant downsides but in the past it

716
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,759
was jail so I mean that was easy

717
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,440
decision well this is changing gradually

718
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:35,319
all over the world that's in many other

719
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,440
countries so that's very exciting last

720
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:39,038
question then I would like to open for

721
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,000
uh questions from the public from the

722
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:44,319
audience sorry uh um doin Domino's

723
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
effect or potential influence to the

724
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:50,558
rest of uh Europe what do you think in

725
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,200
each vertical or you know 100% this will

726
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:55,000
happen so I would even say that most

727
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,880
countries in Europe will be even more

728
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,880
bullish than Germany when it comes to

729
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,840
the legalization framework I would say

730
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,559
especially Czech Republic we we hear

731
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:06,038
more and more rumors that they will even

732
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:08,638
skip this medical part and just go all

733
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:10,798
in right from the beginning so let's see

734
00:31:08,638 --> 00:31:13,798
but this was a very very big impact on

735
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:13,798
all the other countries for

736
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:20,119
sure ah there's any questions from the

737
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:29,319
[Applause]

738
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:29,319
audience check check there we go

739
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:36,879
questions questions who oh all right all

740
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,759
the way up there's a microphone right up

741
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,278
there so that my lazy ass doesn't have

742
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:44,480
to climb these stairs 16 times a day

743
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:46,960
there you go hi um my name is Trenton

744
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,399
Birch I come from South Africa um I'd

745
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,798
like to know what the panel's opinion is

746
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:54,398
on the future of outdoor cultivation um

747
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:56,798
because obviously at the moment the

748
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:58,798
farma industry is very much leading

749
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:00,398
medical cannabis but we all know that

750
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:03,278
cultivating outdoor under netting or

751
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:05,398
under tunnels or green door is uh vastly

752
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:07,599
different in terms of price do you think

753
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:09,119
there is a future for outdoor cannabis

754
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:12,199
for the medical industry from the likes

755
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:14,319
of Columbia and South Africa Etc thanks

756
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,519
so when once there will be recreational

757
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:18,480
Market here for sure right now in the

758
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:20,720
medical Market it's really hard to

759
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,880
achieve the micro values when you do

760
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,960
100% outdoor I'm I'm very honest to you

761
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,760
I visited now I think 150 growing

762
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,600
facilities in the Last 5 Years From

763
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:35,558
outdoor Greenhouse indoor whatever kind

764
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:38,240
of of quality and uh I have to really

765
00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:40,158
admit that medical grade 100% outdoor

766
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,319
woo this is this is more than

767
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:45,440
challenging and if you have on the other

768
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:48,038
hands uh facilities who do the run

769
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,558
indoor producing decent quality to a

770
00:32:48,038 --> 00:32:52,079
decent price not using radiation because

771
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:54,278
I would sense that there would be

772
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:57,199
radiation needed for for micro level

773
00:32:54,278 --> 00:32:58,960
bringing down if you do 100% outdoor but

774
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,080
I don't know about this will be a hard

775
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,079
hard challenge for the medical

776
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,599
Market anyone else have a question

777
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:10,599
anyone closer to me

778
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,880
perhaps all right you've all been

779
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:15,880
thoroughly oh thank you so

780

much hi right guys um there's I'm

781
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:24,519
hearing a lot and I'm very interested in

782
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:27,359
the German Market actually I live here

783
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:28,880
and I help develop the business my

784
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:30,638
economic development agency of the

785
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,039
federal republic so right from the top

786
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:34,158
back when it was the commissioner for

787
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:36,038
foreign investment um to invest in

788
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,000
Germany Germany trade invest and I've

789
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:39,919
been hearing a lot from doctors about a

790
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,839
database that's coming out I'm not

791
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,159
really sure but they're going to be um

792
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:44,638
collecting it's supposed to be also

793
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:45,919
coming out do you guys know about the

794
00:33:44,638 --> 00:33:49,000
status base while they're giving

795
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,600
practical experience how to other

796
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,319
doctors um about everything from

797
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:56,119
Parkinson to where where it can be used

798
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:57,398
sleep um what for whatever use this is

799
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:59,319
something that one of the pharmaceutical

800
00:33:57,398 --> 00:34:02,119
groups in Germany is doing any anybody

801
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:03,879
know about that or not in particularly

802
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:05,479
because there are so many of these

803
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,399
projects and we as an industry we are

804
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,039
working very very closely together on

805
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:11,519
that when it comes to education show um

806
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:13,480
because there were so many doctors

807
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,679
already applying for cannabis The Last 5

808
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,719
Years which are very well known among

809
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:21,079
the doctor's circles so to say and we

810
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:23,000
try to make videos with them together

811
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:25,440
bringing this to educational platforms

812
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,199
sharing everything just to educate them

813
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,800
so I will be very very sure that there

814
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:32,118
will be some something like this in the

815
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,960
future very nearby I'll find out who but

816
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:35,440
um there is a German group working on

817
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,320
one of the pharmaceutical companies

818
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,039
right now is putting together a database

819
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,320
for and that will be shared all the

820
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:42,878
little qualitate circles that the German

821
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,039
doctors have they're they're getting

822
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:46,679
this information now so but if you it

823
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,239
depends really on what kind of data you

824
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,679
look at if you're looking really at I

825
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,358
mean what the German reimbursement

826
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,358
system when we come back to that point

827
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,759
Val is like phase three double blind

828
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:56,960
data uh and you won't have that from

829
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,720
what you described there too many

830
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,559
strains out that too many extracts as we

831
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:03,919
described to really get reliable medical

832
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:06,639
data which then can be used in terms of

833
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,639
what German doctors adere often to and

834
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,838
that's what we try to educate hey let's

835
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,799
talk about cannabis as such about TT and

836
00:35:10,838 --> 00:35:16,519
the potency and then try out on how to

837
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:19,839
best um or try to find the best fit for

838
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:21,519
your patient in the end I I would like

839
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:24,239
to ask a question about that too I mean

840
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:25,920
I feel like it's a challenge because

841
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,399
cannabis is so different person to

842
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,519
person like one person

843
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,639
really likes OG Kush another person has

844
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:33,960
completely different effects maybe it

845
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:35,519
makes one person sleepy it keeps one

846
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,039
person awake how do you quantify that

847
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:40,920
how do you make it so

848
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:42,838
that I I don't even know I mean I think

849
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,838
in the long long run when it comes to a

850
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:47,960
data perspective um first thing that the

851
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:50,679
doctors will do will clustering diseases

852
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:53,199
and certain kind of extracts or flowers

853
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:55,598
or even turpine profiles and then you

854
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:57,838
can just put your strains which are

855
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,160
fitting into certain profiles into that

856
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:01,920
because even if you look at the data of

857
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:04,838
course there will be some exceptions for

858
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,760
that top to down as well but you can

859
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:09,239
definitely find something like okay this

860
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,280
strain is working for maybe 60% of the

861
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:15,118
patients for going to bed this strain is

862
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,240
working maybe 80% for the per or 30% you

863
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,200
never know and with this kind of data

864
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:20,759
you will make the the business not even

865
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:22,318
for us but for the doctors for everyone

866
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,640
in the industry much more easier when it

867
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:26,639
comes to this categorization because we

868
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:29,920
have to do that no no Pharmacy is

869
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:31,759
willing to to have 500 strains in their

870
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,519
vault and in their storage because it's

871
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,000
a logistical nightmare to be honest and

872
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:38,519
therefore we have to strip this down

873
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,400
into very very functional groups of yeah

874
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:43,440
diseases turpine canab Pro profiles and

875
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,440
then you go from there fantastic there's

876
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,440
a question up here thanks for the panel

877
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,559
you guys are doing a great job what role

878
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,559
does CBD and other minor cannabinoids

879
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:53,799
come to play in the medical Market uh in

880
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:56,318
Germany and then the second part of the

881
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,119
question is format uh other than fla

882
00:36:56,318 --> 00:36:59,279
what other formats do you see

883
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:02,200
coming

884
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,680
online maybe I I kick it off here so

885
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:06,799
first of all if we are talking about the

886
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:10,000
medical cannibis Market we typically

887
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:13,280
mean THC content above

888
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,838
0.5% so I I would say this panel here

889
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:21,240
represents really not a the relevance of

890
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:23,880
any CBD product typical forms that we

891
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:26,318
have are flowers around 60% of the

892
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:30,000
market Revenue then another around maybe

893
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:32,279
20 25ish % is full spectrum extract and

894
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,639
the rest is like isolate which is mainly

895
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,519
dronabinol this means magistral

896
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:39,759
formulations and then there are like

897
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:44,639
very very limited finished products that

898
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:47,599
are available so I would say CBD is not

899
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:50,199
playing a relevant role as of now in the

900
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,079
medical market and when it comes to the

901
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:55,719
forms we are still very much at the

902
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:57,800
beginning yes but research is going on

903
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:59,879
onto that because um for examp example

904
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,839
in the US we have a recreational market

905
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,599
so we have more options to to test

906
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:07,920
products and we just find out that if

907
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,039
you for example do a certain kind of

908
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,039
timeline for single cannabinoids in a

909
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:14,599
pill or something like this working

910
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:16,400
after 1 hour after 3 hour after 5 hour

911
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:19,680
you can really steer for example the

912
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,280
sleeping process up to 8 hours totally

913
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:23,598
controlled and this is something we have

914
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,000
to learn but with the upcoming industry

915
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,000
in Europe the upcoming researches data

916
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,960
collections I think in the next years we

917
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:35,280
will have some good outcome for all of

918
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:40,079
us maybe I can add to that we saw um

919
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:44,240
companies trying to uh bring a CBD uh

920
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:46,359
sorry E-liquid wean on the market for

921
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:49,598
THC for patients but this is a very

922
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:51,799
complicated procedure so you need a c

923
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:55,318
you need a pre-market authorization you

924
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:57,880
need a c Mark approved by an expert

925
00:38:55,318 --> 00:39:00,079
group and this is very hard to to

926
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,240
achieve or to get and compan is still

927
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,839
trying to do that so we'll still have to

928
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:06,879
wait for for that even for that small

929
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:09,519
simple

930
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,280
product so actually I have a question um

931
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:13,960
about the formulas you actually touched

932
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,720
into to something that I that I that I

933
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:20,000
like so you talked about the profile of

934
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:24,639
minoc cannabinoids thines formulas

935
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:27,920
pathologies um so uh now the EU

936
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:31,519
monograph if I'm not if I'm correct and

937
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:34,519
the German monograph does not

938
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:37,639
require the the the disclosing of minor

939
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:39,639
cannabinoids or terap is only THD in CBD

940
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:40,920
correct but you're actually going

941
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:44,440
further

942
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:46,920
so are you I mean uh are you when you

943
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:49,400
are you testing also for for the for the

944
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,920
other compon components of of the flower

945
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,720
the extract yes sure because we as an

946
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,519
industry we have to learn about our

947
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:58,279
products of course and how they work and

948
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,559
um yeah

949
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,440
cannabis is a little bit more

950
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:03,880
complicated because it's has such an

951
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,559
individual effect on the on the human

952
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,358
body and so for we have to learn that

953
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:09,559
but of course standardization of

954
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:11,078
products is one of our main goals and

955
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:13,159
therefore we have to do the research on

956
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:16,039
that so you said uh there there

957
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:18,078
shouldn't be too many types of genetics

958
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:20,239
otherwise everybody goes crazy or we

959
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,760
don't know how to follow have you chosen

960
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:27,439
your genetics how many my personal yeah

961
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,359
I mean for yes for 420 Pharma three uh I

962
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,838
I I selected by myself and of course we

963
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:34,358
have some more guys in the team but two

964
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:36,000
of those I selected personally were a

965
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:38,119
market hitter so what kind of

966
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,679
pathologist are you trying to

967
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:43,160
Target but you got to say that there's

968
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:45,000
really big demand for huge variation I

969
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:46,838
mean as you said it's a nightmare from a

970
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
supply chain perspective but you got to

971
00:40:46,838 --> 00:40:51,639
see what the market wants so um there's

972
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,079
always quite some request to get new

973
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:56,118
product as well on the market what does

974
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:59,240
the market want so so maybe good

975
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:59,240
cannabis I hate to cutch you

976
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,358
actually out of time I apologize it was

977
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,280
I know it was just really getting good

978
00:41:04,358 --> 00:41:08,318
but uh we're we are overtime let's hear

979
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:13,400
it again for the whole

980
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:15,559
panel Claudia kman Benedict Dr Goble and

981
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,318
Thomas shuton uh I'm sure if you want to

982
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:19,480
talk more they'll talk to you out there

983
00:41:17,318 --> 00:41:22,039
this is the Berlin International

984
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:24,800
cannabis business conference 2024 we'd

985
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:26,880
like to thank the tomman group our title

986
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,720
sponsor we'd like to thank all of y'all
