compliance with transaction so that

5
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:14,099
banks are very easily able to run their

6
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:16,469
cannabis programs it's practically a

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:20,778
turnkey compliance program that is

8
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:24,919
actually run off of technology with with

9
00:00:20,778 --> 00:00:30,570
multiple lines of tracking and and

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:32,340
transaction reporting so Allison cool

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,920
I'm Allison cough I'm the founder and

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,120
CEO of a company called Artemis we are a

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,829
software provider for the cannabis

14
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,899
industry and our core product is the

15
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,689
cultivation management platform helps

16
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,219
automate all the people plants processes

17
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:47,549
and compliance that you've got going on

18
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,989
specifically built for cultivators so

19
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:50,308
we're not doing POS we're not doing all

20
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:51,929
those other things but we built it in an

21
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:53,698
integrated way so you can tie into

22
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:56,039
whatever systems you choose to use and

23
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:59,789
and actually I guess each one to say

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,679
where you're based sorry San Jose and we

25
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,409
we actually have operations in

26
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,450
California Massachusetts Nevada and

27
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,570
Washington for your finance thing what

28
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,270
about you with your stuff my stuff yeah

29
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:14,309
growing stuff we're based in Brooklyn

30
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:16,349
New York but we also have offices around

31
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,180
the country as well as North America and

32
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:19,798
we're global so we're in Europe as well

33
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,720
in Australia well I guess if you have

34
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,040
operating clients can use like she said

35
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:24,239
the states where people are using her

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,240
software where are people using your

37
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,158
software almost every state that's legal

38
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,170
yeah and we're also we have a we came

39
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,790
from the non cannabis space first so we

40
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,189
had been selling to Trish more

41
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,409
traditional operations and so we've got

42
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:38,429
I think every state on the non cannabis

43
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,590
side and every legal state when the

44
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,689
cannabis ID

45
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:46,649
I'm Michael Pavlik I'm out of Detroit

46
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:48,508
Michigan and we focus on seem to sell

47
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:51,390
compliance software and with stash stock

48
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:54,899
as a company name we really focus on the

49
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,239
RFID aspect in the metric states making

50
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,829
a no touch solution where you don't have

51
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:00,688
to touch your plants while you're moving

52
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:03,718
them and having real-time visibility

53
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:06,669
into all of your cultivation and

54
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:08,739
processing concerns and

55
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:11,199
I was a grower for eight years before

56
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:14,260
this and have 15 years of technology

57
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:16,269
background so trying to bridge my

58
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:18,969
experience from cultivation

59
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:23,230
into technology and providing that to

60
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:25,750
licensed growers amazing

61
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:29,199
I'm Joel Sherlock vancouver-based I

62
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:31,810
think spend a 250 days on the road we

63
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,639
have a manufacturing business one of the

64
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,739
leading manufacturers of the extraction

65
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:38,348
machines the power a lot of these great

66
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:40,719
people making oil products so we make

67
00:02:38,348 --> 00:02:42,340
co2 and ethanol ethanol equipment and

68
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,650
much like a lot of people on the stage

69
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,620
with me we are global when four

70
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,360
continents and offices on three great

71
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,370
and I'll give you some context on me my

72
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,650
name is Justin Hall my ticket to this

73
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,900
party is that I registered but calm 26

74
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,750
years ago and I know my way around a web

75
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:01,950
browser so I'm the CTO but calm we do

76
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:04,719
e-commerce for cannabis and hemp

77
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:07,419
pre-rolls and for CBD wellness products

78
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,849
we serve California with our cannabis

79
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:13,539
THC products and then we ship around the

80
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:15,579
world people like stuff like weed so I

81
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:17,560
think what's really interesting is that

82
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:18,969
if you look at each of you you would

83
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,199
have different visibility into the

84
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:21,969
cannabis industry you would have

85
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:23,469
visibility into payment streams you

86
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:26,289
would have you two would have visibility

87
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:27,939
into growth growth trends and you would

88
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:30,310
have visibility into how people are

89
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:31,810
extracting cannabis and where people

90
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,340
there's demand for your software there's

91
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,840
there's the growth of the industry so I

92
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,239
wonder if one of you wants to wade in

93
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,890
and and and take what I just said as a

94
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:41,560
prompt to promote the thing that you're

95
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:46,119
working on because that's what panels

96
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:48,159
are so bring it on sure so what artery

97
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,530
pay does is actually offers a completely

98
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,590
legal payment solution my background is

99
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,150
actually financial institution law and

100
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,439
operations and that's financial

101
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,060
institution operations so how the

102
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:01,000
sausage is in fact made the back-office

103
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:03,280
stuff and one of the things that we were

104
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,359
able to do actually because of my

105
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,310
background is to build the mrb FinCEN

106
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:11,350
compliance requirements and I'm going to

107
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,019
tell what those acronyms are because we

108
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:15,659
talked about this right before so Mr B

109
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:17,579
means marijuana business

110
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:20,129
and that is a class of a regulatory

111
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,620
classification by the financial crimes

112
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:25,649
enforcement part of the Treasury

113
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,560
Department with the federal government

114
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:31,319
everybody is required to follow these

115
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,910
regulations if they want to work with

116
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,189
the cannabis industry but it can be

117
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,840
pretty cumbersome for banks to actually

118
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:39,449
be able to engage with the space based

119
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:41,519
on this the added cost and so we built

120
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:44,250
it into the transaction system to make

121
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,560
sure that that cost was not the reason

122
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,019
why a bank that was interested in

123
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,959
working with the cannabis space could

124
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:55,919
not work with it it is not a legal issue

125
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:57,989
in fact it is very much a cost benefit

126
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,990
analysis that they go through and so we

127
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:03,449
bring that cost down to a very very low

128
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,850
reasonable rate for them and make

129
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:07,949
training much more efficient much easier

130
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:11,340
and provide a platform to them that

131
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:14,159
allows us to actually access the

132
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:16,500
financial systems openly and with these

133
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,000
partners rather than you know trying to

134
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,279
sneak in or saying that it's a

135
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,649
workaround you don't have workarounds in

136
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:25,019
finance that is absolutely it you're

137
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:27,569
basically between cannabis and finance

138
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:29,279
you have one highly regulated industry

139
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:30,750
and another highly regulated industry

140
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,489
and you're just piling regulations on

141
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,459
top of each other and the interplay of

142
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,410
those things end up causing a lot of

143
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:39,209
complications and that's really what's

144
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:42,210
causing the issues around lack of access

145
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:44,969
and so we are bringing in new banks we

146
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:47,489
are onboarding them all the time and we

147
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,350
are able to provide them with the

148
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,810
systems that make it possible for us to

149
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:54,150
provide you with completely legal

150
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:57,240
completely transparent payments on a

151
00:05:54,149 --> 00:06:00,859
digital platform so also highly

152
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,569
integrated where we are agnostic as to

153
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,580
as to other softwares that you would be

154
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:07,409
using so it's a very easy to use your

155
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:09,839
customers can download the app and

156
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,340
actually go in and pay you in store very

157
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,879
very simple and it works

158
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:16,918
multichannel so online on the go in

159
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:20,939
store doesn't matter where you are you

160
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:22,740
can use this okay so that's so and you

161
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:25,529
would have visibility into the financial

162
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,579
growth and so can you pluck something

163
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:28,019
off the top of your head that's

164
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:28,819
interesting that you've seen about the

165
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:31,549
financial pattern

166
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:35,029
the cannabis industry using artery sure

167
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:38,560
so dispensaries are still primarily

168
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:41,539
using cash or in some places they are

169
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,879
unfortunately using things that they're

170
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,370
not actually allowed to use they

171
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,050
probably don't know that credit cards is

172
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,480
illegal for this industry period stop

173
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:53,180
halt like in in the United States now

174
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,460
there's a these are all united states

175
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:58,090
specific issues because the financial

176
00:06:55,459 --> 00:07:00,979
regulations are United States Pacific so

177
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:04,189
from our perspective you're seeing a lot

178
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:06,319
of you're seeing a lot of people who

179
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:08,120
maybe don't have the background coming

180
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,290
into the space and selling products that

181
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,360
they're not allowed to sell into this

182
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:13,760
space so really having someone with an

183
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,770
operating background in finance is is

184
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,089
kind of critically important to making

185
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:20,019
sure that you don't have that sort of

186
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:22,729
problem and of course when that happens

187
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:24,799
we see a lot of bank shutdowns we see it

188
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,360
I think almost everybody who's in the

189
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,430
cannabis space has experienced something

190
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,500
where they've ended up through no fault

191
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:34,120
of their own having their bank accounts

192
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:39,439
revoked and so we see a lot of that okay

193
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:41,750
that sounds like accurate data yeah sure

194
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,459
I mean like Michael I was also on the

195
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:46,310
growing side before this and and worked

196
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:48,259
as an operator and so the thing that I

197
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:50,500
think I'm most passionate about in this

198
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:53,389
space is solving the issues around

199
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,579
technology scale and usability and how

200
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:58,399
do you get people to actually love using

201
00:07:55,579 --> 00:08:00,680
technology which isn't as easy as it

202
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,659
sounds this is new technology it's got a

203
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,110
lot of issues we've got security issues

204
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,580
we've got scaling issues you've got

205
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:10,069
offline access issues where you have

206
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:11,300
remote areas for him specifically in

207
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:14,290
particular where you've got a lot of

208
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:17,300
field accessibility issues you've got a

209
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:18,680
large migrant population working in the

210
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,270
fields when you're talking about outdoor

211
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,100
you're talking about farm workers who

212
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:23,659
move from one facility to another often

213
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,129
so you've got traceability issues and

214
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,570
lack of transparency when you data

215
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,319
leaves one facility because you have

216
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:29,180
workers leaving

217
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:30,800
you've got illiteracy issues amongst

218
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,930
workers you've got language barriers

219
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,479
you've got these the slew of challenges

220
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,098
that make solving technology issues in

221
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,319
this space

222
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:41,860
really really interesting and really

223
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:44,049
hard and so the approach that we took as

224
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,419
a technology company was what can we

225
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:48,338
solve for growers that I knew to be a

226
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:50,469
major issue because it was something I

227
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:53,139
would have paid for as an operator but

228
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:55,389
also starting with the things that are

229
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:57,818
sticky enough that get you into a system

230
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:59,799
until you love it and then layer on the

231
00:08:57,818 --> 00:09:01,629
things that you really really need sort

232
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:05,139
of thereafter right and so instead of

233
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:06,939
starting from maybe the the regulation

234
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:08,948
side where a lot of the other companies

235
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,360
started where they said hey here's a

236
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:13,208
huge business opportunity right we can

237
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,800
build regulated regulatory software we

238
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:16,179
can link in we can trace we can get

239
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,769
government's to the point where they can

240
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:19,179
track products so they can tax against

241
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:22,209
it which is fine great business

242
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:23,169
opportunity we said well you know what

243
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,609
you're doing there though is you're

244
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:27,429
creating regulatory software you're not

245
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:29,230
creating growers software and so we said

246
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:32,078
you know you got a build software that

247
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,819
people can use on a day to day basis so

248
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:36,159
start with tracking plants in a way that

249
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:38,469
is a production value to me so give me

250
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,719
crop scheduling give me estimates on

251
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:43,089
yield give me how many workers I'm gonna

252
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,980
need today tomorrow next week six months

253
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:46,120
from now give me the ability to do

254
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,649
purchase orders but not from a

255
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,269
regulatory standpoint give it to me from

256
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:50,980
a forecasting standpoint so I know if

257
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:52,688
I'm running low on something I'm not

258
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,339
gonna run out of it and I can actually

259
00:09:52,688 --> 00:09:56,679
send that with a one click to my vendors

260
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:58,269
or on the sales side instead of saying I

261
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,649
want a POS just so that I can track it

262
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:01,629
again from a financial or regulatory

263
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:03,309
standpoint give it to me so that I can

264
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:05,019
do sales order so I can forecast and see

265
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:08,229
sell-through rates of my products and

266
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:09,789
start to adjust my production schedules

267
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,980
based off what's actually selling in the

268
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:14,889
market those types of insights that to

269
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,480
me make me or cost me a lot of money and

270
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:18,879
we started there and we started layering

271
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,990
on top of that so that we could be in

272
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:21,578
all the metric states right have a

273
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,350
seamless metric integration try and

274
00:10:21,578 --> 00:10:25,359
replace the experience with bad things

275
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,620
that people don't like doing with good

276
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,240
things that they really love doing

277
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,310
because it's a tool for me in my

278
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,409
operation okay that sounds like great

279
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:36,388
tool so any data nuggets that you would

280
00:10:32,409 --> 00:10:36,389
pluck from your tool roll out

281
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:43,590
observations across the data landscape

282
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:44,820
yeah I think the the tip I always give

283
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,740
all I'll give this because I've seen it

284
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,660
a lot a lot of times is that when you're

285
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,870
evaluating things think about the things

286
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:52,799
that you can replace pen and paper first

287
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:54,240
because there are things that you know

288
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,559
that you have to do because you're doing

289
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,879
them on a day-by-day basis so if you

290
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:59,939
look at you around your facility and

291
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:02,129
you're like oh yeah I'm recording pH on

292
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,050
my and I have got a log on my wall can

293
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:05,309
you put that in a software system or can

294
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:07,229
you look at those things first because

295
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:09,149
the more things you can replace that are

296
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,430
very manual one you're just gonna

297
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:13,169
immediately have an ROI and - it's gonna

298
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:15,809
be tracing that information so that if

299
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:16,919
Joe who's tracking pH leaves you

300
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:18,089
actually have a system and you know what

301
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:20,189
the pH was three weeks ago

302
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,990
and so those types of things I think the

303
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,000
number one mistake we make all the time

304
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,620
is when we're evaluating technology we

305
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,720
get sucked into what features are cool

306
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,639
what the newest thing is I want to have

307
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,100
AI and everything right like all these

308
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:33,269
things that are sexy and technology but

309
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,740
the reality is the thing you're gonna

310
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:39,059
use every day replaces something that

311
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:41,370
you're already doing yeah I think a lot

312
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:43,589
of you know what Allison is saying is

313
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:48,060
same for us but one of the things that

314
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:50,370
we really look at is scale so as a

315
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:53,069
company let's say we deal with someone

316
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,509
who can grow 10,000 plants but they want

317
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,340
to get familiar with it first so they're

318
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:58,889
gonna start with 500 and they're very

319
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:01,110
successful at 500 now they go up to a

320
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:03,389
two thousand at two thousand now they're

321
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,950
struggling why does that happen they

322
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,870
don't have a technology in place they

323
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:09,240
don't have something that's going to

324
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:12,539
make that economy of scale of compliance

325
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,669
and drive that cost down so right now a

326
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:17,399
lot of operators actually as you scale

327
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:19,709
your cost is going up around complaints

328
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,299
because you have more people you have to

329
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:23,129
train these people the first person

330
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:25,259
maybe does a really good job the second

331
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:27,629
person maybe does a decent job third

332
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:29,759
fourth fifth person your training it's

333
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:31,139
just more and more effort to make sure

334
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,720
that they're doing that same good job

335
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:36,240
how can we bring a technology in and say

336
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,000
that one person can do the whole scale

337
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,580
or two people can manage it instead of

338
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,139
five or ten so that's one of the things

339
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:47,810
we really focus on is a scalability of

340
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:50,269
cultivators to not have a

341
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:52,789
burden of manual effort around

342
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:54,740
compliance utilize the technology to

343
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:57,500
automatically capture and record things

344
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:00,110
accurately quickly you don't have to

345
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,850
hire these people and then using

346
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,980
technology you're not interacting with

347
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,600
your plants as much your contamination

348
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,089
risk is going down so you're getting up

349
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,610
a bigger yield at the end because you're

350
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:13,279
not having to waste as much stuff right

351
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:16,639
so those are things that we're looking

352
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:18,799
at in in terms of technology and again

353
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,039
replacing some of these manual process

354
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:25,519
so that that time just goes away and and

355
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:28,189
you people are using your software yeah

356
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,110
they're saving time and what what have

357
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,570
you gleaned from watching the way people

358
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:36,710
use their software one of the things

359
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:38,420
that that we struggle with is operators

360
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:40,940
that have been doing it manually and

361
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:42,620
they look at the technology instantly it

362
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:45,260
resonates circle oh my god you're gonna

363
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:48,289
save me all this effort but when we talk

364
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:50,240
to startups or facilities that are just

365
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:52,279
getting rolling they believe they're not

366
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,169
going to make any mistakes and they

367
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:56,629
believe that the process in place is

368
00:13:54,169 --> 00:14:00,169
going to be followed perfectly by every

369
00:13:56,629 --> 00:14:01,939
employee and inevitably it's not and we

370
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:04,849
see a lot of times people will call us

371
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,950
like oh my god I moved 500 plants and I

372
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:08,930
had lost three of them or whatever it

373
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:11,450
took me 20 hours to track those three

374
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:12,739
down while using the technology we can

375
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,930
find those plants in about five minutes

376
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,750
so you're talking about hours of effort

377
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:20,419
versus minutes on mistakes and people

378
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:23,149
don't want to talk about mistakes they

379
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:24,860
happen all the freaking time and you

380
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:26,600
have to account for it and how are you

381
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,539
gonna mitigate those risks because one

382
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,000
mistake can cost you tons of man-hours

383
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:36,829
if you don't have a good process in

384
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,220
place the one that the token hardware

385
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,950
guy

386
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:43,040
token hardware guy well I think a lot of

387
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:45,800
people look at data and technology kind

388
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,939
of you know as okay can speed things up

389
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:48,500
but may be able to save me some time but

390
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,730
a lot of people missed the fact that I

391
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,200
think one of the only guarantees we have

392
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,220
in this industry is change and it

393
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,400
changes quickly

394
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:58,009
so then investment in data you know that

395
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:59,840
investment in having those systems so

396
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:02,240
that as you're changing you have better

397
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,550
to go back on I mean we're focused kind

398
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,100
of after you guys have done your all the

399
00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:09,919
great work and then product is dry right

400
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,110
we're focused on extracting it but you

401
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,309
know there's gonna be change in a lot of

402
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,960
the products that our clients would be

403
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:17,689
making a year from now or just being a

404
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,910
thought of or dreamt up right now so you

405
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:22,550
know flexibility in that infrastructure

406
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:26,360
but ultimately it's led by the data how

407
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:29,000
do you grow more THC P or you know any

408
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,100
cbgc PN whatever it is like we can only

409
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,730
extract up to a hundred percent of

410
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:37,399
what's grown no more let me figure that

411
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:39,860
part out yet but you know it's that side

412
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:42,259
of you know going back to that data as

413
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,539
the products change to figure out okay

414
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:46,580
well what did we do and that one grow

415
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:49,459
run where we saw a spike in this thing

416
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:51,980
that we're now looking for okay you just

417
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,330
ended your remarks there I will say that

418
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,399
I've chatted with this gentleman before

419
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:57,620
it was today so the information is fresh

420
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,449
the company he's worked for has made

421
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,190
many of these machines that extract

422
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,320
cannabis oil that can be used then to

423
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:05,120
make other products so those that the

424
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,100
machines that your companies made are

425
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,870
distributed around the world in two

426
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,250
different countries so man you've got to

427
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:12,289
have some interesting data on how

428
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:15,409
extractions going over here versus over

429
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:17,269
there or something well I think you yeah

430
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:19,370
I mean we definitely see there's lots to

431
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:21,439
be learned right and there's a ton of

432
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:23,509
mistakes that have been made but so many

433
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,310
people are not open to really

434
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:28,879
understanding I mean in the early days

435
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:31,429
of the Canadian you know the funded

436
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,509
capacity giant greenhouses and then they

437
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:34,279
were like oh we can't learn anything

438
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:35,659
from the guys from California it's like

439
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:37,549
someone making half a million vape

440
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:39,259
cartridges a month he's gonna have the

441
00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:40,370
same bottlenecks that you were gonna

442
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:41,600
have when Canada

443
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,089
maybe one day gets to that point

444
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,480
hopefully you know we're starting to see

445
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:51,020
a lot of growth in big pharma companies

446
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:53,649
stepping in in the EU ecosystem it's all

447
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:55,730
you GMP which is a Pharma level so it's

448
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:58,579
significantly higher barrier to entry

449
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:02,300
once you get past like cultivation can

450
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:04,549
be done in G ACP like farming practices

451
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:07,849
but EU GMP or good manufacturing

452
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:10,178
practices is extremely you know lots of

453
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:12,188
documentation track everything

454
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:14,199
each piece of equipment that touches the

455
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:15,548
oil has to be you know you have to know

456
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,528
where the steel came from how do you

457
00:17:15,548 --> 00:17:20,618
clean it like it's it's really really

458
00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:22,689
comprehensive so you know but they don't

459
00:17:20,618 --> 00:17:23,918
have cannabis experience at the level

460
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:27,339
that we do so you know I think

461
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:29,169
ultimately you can even learn something

462
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:32,079
from every single market and you can

463
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:34,149
learn from other people's mistakes yes

464
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:35,949
and mistakes that's good that's a segue

465
00:17:34,148 --> 00:17:38,138
to the next question which is if you

466
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:40,419
make mistakes you poison people if you

467
00:17:38,138 --> 00:17:42,008
guys make with your company so if you

468
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:44,288
guys make mistakes people lose their

469
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:46,628
crops or grow the wrong thing or may

470
00:17:44,288 --> 00:17:48,278
poison people too if you screw up people

471
00:17:46,628 --> 00:17:51,278
could be accused of money laundering and

472
00:17:48,278 --> 00:17:53,528
go to jail if I screw up people get the

473
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:55,058
you know get the wrong get get a hybrid

474
00:17:53,528 --> 00:17:58,569
instead of a sativa vape cart delivered

475
00:17:55,058 --> 00:18:00,460
to their house so so let's talk here but

476
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:02,230
if you guys are looking at what failure

477
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,259
is how does somebody evaluating your

478
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:10,480
solution decide that you're trustworthy

479
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:12,399
when the stakes are high so you have to

480
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,710
look at people's backgrounds if you're

481
00:18:12,398 --> 00:18:16,658
not focused on people's backgrounds and

482
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:19,990
you can't find out who's running a

483
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:22,110
company or they say they're in quotation

484
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:25,929
marks an ISO which stands for

485
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:27,878
independent sales organization you've

486
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:31,659
got to know that anybody who is just

487
00:18:27,878 --> 00:18:34,240
sales probably doesn't really know

488
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:36,639
what's going on in the back and can't

489
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,589
really explain what you're supposed to

490
00:18:36,638 --> 00:18:40,839
be doing and what you're not and you

491
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:43,028
know the best way to evaluate some

492
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:44,829
vendors and I hate to say this because

493
00:18:43,028 --> 00:18:47,558
it sounds like I'm you know plugging

494
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:50,710
lawyers but get your corporate lawyers

495
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:52,210
involved if anybody is going to be able

496
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,850
to evaluate whether this is going to

497
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:57,340
actually pass muster they're going to be

498
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:58,868
able to do so and you know it's a little

499
00:18:57,339 --> 00:19:00,339
bit tricky because from the financial

500
00:18:58,868 --> 00:19:02,168
services space actually the best

501
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,819
financial institution lawyers they're

502
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:06,249
all in New York City I mean it just

503
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:08,470
happens that that is like our core the

504
00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:09,850
core location so if you have people who

505
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:13,179
are coming from that kind of a

506
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:14,980
background that really have have been

507
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:16,990
focused on the financial space in New

508
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,019
York City like that's really good

509
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,740
credentials that's really outstanding

510
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:23,120
for you know somebody who

511
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:27,019
is coming in and is you know a

512
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:28,879
relationship manager may or may not know

513
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:30,200
what they're talking about and so when

514
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,630
it comes down to it you really want to

515
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,610
dig into what they're doing and if after

516
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,380
you've signed a non-disclosure agreement

517
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:38,599
with people they're still not willing to

518
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,610
tell you who the financial institutions

519
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:43,788
are that are backing them and that are

520
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:46,879
working with them that's a huge red flag

521
00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:49,490
another huge red flag in this space

522
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,520
specific to specific to cannabis

523
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:56,419
regulation financial regulation on that

524
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:59,089
is when someone is calling an EMR be a

525
00:19:56,419 --> 00:20:01,820
CR B because they're trying to rebrand a

526
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:04,158
regulatory category and that is not

527
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:05,839
kosher that is not kosher at all you

528
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,460
have to wonder whether these people are

529
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:10,699
actually focused on what's best for you

530
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,409
or if they're just you know going ahead

531
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,899
and selling you something that either

532
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:16,940
you don't need or isn't sustainable

533
00:20:14,898 --> 00:20:18,918
and that's another focus like you really

534
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,870
have to dig into this because you are

535
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:22,880
heavily regulated and on the financial

536
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:25,428
side unfortunately mistakes are not

537
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,600
forgiven yeah I mean you're not only

538
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:28,490
innovating tech you're innovating

539
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:30,500
finance and if we innovate finance as

540
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:33,589
much they kind of you might go to jail

541
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,269
oh yeah yeah if you do it wrong you go

542
00:20:33,589 --> 00:20:36,439
to prison and so does everybody in the

543
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:38,450
supply chain that's involved with you

544
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,690
and so be your customers because

545
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:44,210
actually the racketeering statutes in

546
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:47,419
the that our federal federal government

547
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:49,579
and racketeering statutes get everybody

548
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:52,399
on quote conspiracy to money launderer

549
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:53,808
so if you don't know how they work in

550
00:20:52,398 --> 00:20:55,879
the back how they're actually getting

551
00:20:53,808 --> 00:20:58,339
something done you got to get somebody

552
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,350
who can dig in on that and listen your

553
00:20:58,339 --> 00:21:02,000
lawyers can help this is what they do

554
00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:04,250
they do the research that's their job is

555
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,798
to research this stuff for you and give

556
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,450
you counsel and you know if they're

557
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,980
working with you in cannabis they're

558
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:13,340
gonna have no problem with finance I

559
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:16,579
mean it's it's not hard it's not hard

560
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:19,609
lawyers love cannabis they do they love

561
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:21,168
it they use it they love you you make a

562
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:23,759
lot of good work for them and it's fine

563
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:27,240
and good money for them

564
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:28,910
I think I totally agree I mean like you

565
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,720
will feel when you're vetting companies

566
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:32,940
like just make sure you've got the

567
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,950
company well but you feel it right and

568
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,420
so like if you're looking at a software

569
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,620
company go to their website look at

570
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,210
their team right if they don't have

571
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:40,859
software engineers on the team they're

572
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,450
not gonna if it's an outsourced software

573
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:44,789
engineering team you're gonna have a

574
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,319
hack or a break or a down edge in four

575
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:49,049
minutes like it just is gonna happen

576
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,460
because if you're not building the team

577
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:52,559
internally like you have no control over

578
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,819
that product so make sure that the if

579
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,039
it's a software company make sure they

580
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:57,269
have software engineers on the team if

581
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,529
you want to dig even further go to

582
00:21:57,269 --> 00:21:59,490
LinkedIn right and see the background of

583
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:00,779
those people if they have three

584
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:02,640
engineers and they're all recent

585
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:04,889
bootcamp grads like you're gonna have

586
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,420
what happened with shadow like it's just

587
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,740
gonna happen right like this is this is

588
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:10,259
what happens if you don't have control

589
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,880
over your internal team and like that's

590
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:14,549
nothing against those guys I feel bad

591
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,660
that that was their first job but it

592
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:17,220
happens right like if you're a young

593
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,170
engineer it's those things are gonna

594
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,279
happen so make sure that it's an

595
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,990
experienced team make sure that they

596
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:24,210
have a CTO that actually has experience

597
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:26,519
building companies and you can vet that

598
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:28,200
kind of thing make sure you can see who

599
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:29,430
backs them financially right do they

600
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,680
have money in the bank are they gonna be

601
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:33,690
around longer than you are that's very

602
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,789
important uh-huh you want to make sure

603
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,930
that they're going to be around so even

604
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:39,059
if it's venture back to make sure that

605
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:41,970
they have the right sort of structure

606
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:43,589
behind it and that they disclose call

607
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:46,950
their customers get case studies like

608
00:22:43,589 --> 00:22:49,079
all customers do it when you put an

609
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,100
inbound phone call in I did I tested

610
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:52,259
this the other day with some of our

611
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:53,939
competitors and I had fun with it but

612
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:55,230
like put an inbound request and see how

613
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,940
long it takes for them to respond to you

614
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,190
if it takes two and a half weeks and you

615
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,600
still haven't heard anything yeah like

616
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,580
those are the types of things that make

617
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:05,759
a good company in any industry whether

618
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:08,339
it's cannabis or not and so do the like

619
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:10,319
vet the company a little bit and and

620
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:11,309
make sure that they're a good partner

621
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,079
for you because at the end of the day in

622
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:14,220
cannabis specifically it's it's a mulch

623
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:16,109
ice right the market is changing

624
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,819
drastically regulation changes the

625
00:23:16,109 --> 00:23:19,229
financial markets are changing we have

626
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:20,970
elections coming up who knows what'll

627
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:23,069
happen right all of this stuff is really

628
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,960
hard for us in addition to the fact that

629
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:27,899
you're trying to build a business which

630
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,160
is also really hard and so make sure

631
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,840
that you find a good partner that you

632
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,730
gel with make sure they can speak the

633
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:33,538
same language you can you know your

634
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,889
business is better than

635
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:37,200
vendor will ever know it but if they

636
00:23:34,888 --> 00:23:39,269
catch on if they're interested if their

637
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,159
founders is car coming out to your site

638
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:43,048
to see what's going on because they're

639
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:44,190
just curious like that's probably going

640
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:45,778
to be a better partner for you than

641
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:49,619
somebody who you can't get service

642
00:23:45,778 --> 00:23:51,960
access to at any point I agree with

643
00:23:49,618 --> 00:23:53,759
everything that they're saying but you

644
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,850
know my company actually is a little bit

645
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:58,889
newer to the industry but one of the

646
00:23:56,849 --> 00:24:02,238
things that we do you know we're always

647
00:23:58,888 --> 00:24:05,878
on site you can contact us directly

648
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:08,489
we're technology background so the

649
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:10,858
entire team is all software all the time

650
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:13,108
and we partner with large scale

651
00:24:10,858 --> 00:24:15,839
technology providers that do some pretty

652
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:18,329
massive websites and technology

653
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:21,089
deployments but yeah one of the things

654
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:22,528
for us is like a lot of our competitors

655
00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:24,839
are going to install software and

656
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:26,608
hardware in your facility that you're

657
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:29,999
gonna have to manage and make sure it

658
00:24:26,608 --> 00:24:32,878
has proper security and you know that no

659
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:35,308
one's able to get into that box versus

660
00:24:32,878 --> 00:24:38,308
you know everything is cloud for us so

661
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:40,019
we're managing on top of azure we have

662
00:24:38,308 --> 00:24:41,579
all of the built in securities from a

663
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:43,888
cloud provider we don't have to worry

664
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:46,678
about you know someone hacking your

665
00:24:43,888 --> 00:24:50,548
local computer that you put password as

666
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:53,609
the password and stuff like that so you

667
00:24:50,548 --> 00:24:56,579
know how much are we taking off of your

668
00:24:53,608 --> 00:24:58,589
plate from a risk standpoint what

669
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:00,108
technologies are we using what is our

670
00:24:58,589 --> 00:25:03,118
background those are all great questions

671
00:25:00,108 --> 00:25:04,918
surprisingly people ask us for referrals

672
00:25:03,118 --> 00:25:07,558
all the time and I thought that was

673
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:10,349
strange at first but I love when people

674
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:11,970
ask me that because I can give them our

675
00:25:10,348 --> 00:25:13,979
clients that have moved off of other

676
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:16,379
technologies I can say you know who are

677
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:18,869
you evaluating right now I might have

678
00:25:16,378 --> 00:25:20,038
someone that actually was a customer and

679
00:25:18,868 --> 00:25:22,168
switched and they can talk to you about

680
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:23,759
the experience and we'll just connect

681
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:25,169
you directly like it's not like I'm

682
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:27,929
speaking on their behalf

683
00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:30,359
column talk to them directly get a few

684
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:32,639
of them and see what they have to say we

685
00:25:30,358 --> 00:25:34,199
you know that's really the best way I

686
00:25:32,638 --> 00:25:35,908
think a lot of people get sucked into

687
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,830
contracts before they're actually ready

688
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:41,700
for them that's the other thing I would

689
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:44,939
say is be flexible don't get into bed

690
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,360
with anyone too soon we have free offers

691
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,160
so you

692
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:49,769
can use all of our technology for free

693
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:52,470
for an entire growth cycle so you can

694
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:54,029
evaluate it locally see if it actually

695
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:58,200
makes sense for you before you pay

696
00:25:54,029 --> 00:26:00,000
anything so you know we touched on a lot

697
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,130
of the big things people testimonials

698
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,319
you know I think data for sure like

699
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:05,850
there are a lot of big claims and maybe

700
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,220
some unproven claims in the canvas

701
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:09,808
market so just get people to back it up

702
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,880
you know I mean oh that's that's a big

703
00:26:09,808 --> 00:26:14,220
claim show me you know there there's a

704
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,720
lot of data available - I mean there's

705
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:19,079
multi-state operators who have multiple

706
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:21,929
locations you know if you know if

707
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:23,519
somebody buys in our world right it the

708
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:25,048
best thing that someone could do for us

709
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:26,910
is you know once hey we're on another

710
00:26:25,048 --> 00:26:28,619
platform they come over to a Vitalis

711
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:30,570
extraction machine and then every

712
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:32,189
expansion going forward that person's

713
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:34,500
putting in more equipment right I mean

714
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:38,400
that's an investment in this partnership

715
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,690
you know but but look at who are they

716
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,429
working with and are those people

717
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:42,690
continuing to work with them you know

718
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:44,700
that's that's usually a very strong

719
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:46,440
endorsement but you know get those

720
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,480
testimonials talk to their customers

721
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,570
figure out where they good has their

722
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,849
service team because things change

723
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:55,619
problems come up things break and you

724
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:58,230
want somebody who's gonna be there to to

725
00:26:55,619 --> 00:27:00,089
support you speaking to because you can

726
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:02,190
just go look at it like that's a nice

727
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:07,109
thing like go look at the hardware yeah

728
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:08,400
touch it see it so speaking of someone

729
00:27:07,109 --> 00:27:17,969
there to support you let's find a

730
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:19,620
question in the audience somebody has a

731
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:29,730
question someone's got to have one

732
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:32,869
question could you introduce yourself

733
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,870
and say what you're working on

734
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,869
[Music]

735
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:48,280
gonna say the same way and I have to say

736
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:51,129
so far it's been a little bit of a

737
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:52,180
circle to attract tech candidates here

738
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:55,450
in the Bay Area it's a problem in

739
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:57,940
general but then you add on cannabis and

740
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:00,250
I think that scares some of the tech

741
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:04,420
candidates away so I'd love to hear how

742
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:05,829
you've built out that tech team the

743
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,240
question is how do you build out a tech

744
00:28:05,829 --> 00:28:09,879
team when some of the tech candidates

745
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,470
are scared off by cannabis it's like a

746
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,630
caper flick right you gotta go from

747
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:15,160
scene to scene I would talk about

748
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:16,960
mission Lariat like one of the things

749
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,390
that we do above all at our company is

750
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,799
we created a set of core values that are

751
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,990
important to us and how we operate as a

752
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,639
business and we leverage that every

753
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:26,740
single time we're hiring right so we we

754
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,450
push out our core values everywhere and

755
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,130
we talk about them as often as we can

756
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:32,319
and we interview against them and we

757
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:33,760
just sort of embraced this you know we

758
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:35,859
have a mission as a company we care

759
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:37,390
deeply about it and yes of course we

760
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:38,829
want to make money for our shareholders

761
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:40,630
and everything like that that comes with

762
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:42,429
running a business but like at the heart

763
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:45,220
of it the why we do it is just as

764
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:47,440
important and how we operate often Falls

765
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:49,450
in cannon to the why we do it

766
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,620
and like you're gonna find people I mean

767
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,460
there's a roomful of people here who are

768
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:52,869
interested in the cannabis industry

769
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,160
right one of the Bay Area's so

770
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:56,139
presumably some of these people may be

771
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,660
looking for jobs if you're looking for a

772
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,250
job it seems you know she's looking for

773
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,750
attention yeah well if you're an

774
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:04,269
engineer in the room you're looking for

775
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:06,670
a job right but like people in South Bay

776
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:07,900
yeah yeah it's like people are gonna be

777
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,310
passionate about packaging people to

778
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,450
party more at the right at the right

779
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:12,700
party

780
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:14,590
but but talk about the the why you're

781
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,450
doing it because the more often that you

782
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:18,339
talk about the why and not just like hey

783
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:19,509
we're hiring and it's hard to compete on

784
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:22,179
salary in the Bay Area because

785
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:25,089
everybody's paying you know $120,000 for

786
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:27,400
a new entry engineer like instead of

787
00:29:25,089 --> 00:29:29,679
talking about things that are hard for

788
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,960
engineers to be attracted to if you're

789
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,370
only selling what are you doing and why

790
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,200
are you doing it and how do we operate

791
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:36,939
as a company and you're selling yourself

792
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,890
frankly as like the founder right and

793
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,120
then I'm gonna be as a candidate really

794
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,690
attracted to wow that's really

795
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:42,789
interesting

796
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:44,890
maybe it wasn't super passionate about

797
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:46,240
packaging but I love cannabis and so we

798
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,590
can find a way to work together or I'm

799
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,769
really passionate about both of those

800
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:55,679
things and you'll get those people so

801
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:55,680
are you a solo entrepreneur

802
00:29:57,859 --> 00:30:03,869
yeah so that's one of the things that

803
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:06,298
critic yeah that's one of the things

804
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:07,619
that is actually difficult solo

805
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:09,298
entrepreneurs it's not actually about

806
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:12,209
cannabis its solo entrepreneurs you have

807
00:30:09,298 --> 00:30:14,308
a difficult time attracting teams so if

808
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,509
you can find a co-founder who is you

809
00:30:14,308 --> 00:30:17,639
know I don't know if you're the

810
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:19,950
technical person or you're looking for a

811
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,780
technical person to be the co-founder I

812
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,460
think that you will have an easier time

813
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:26,129
pulling in engineers because a lot of

814
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:27,929
times which you have a technical founder

815
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:29,159
they actually have teams that they've

816
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:31,620
worked with before that just love

817
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:34,010
working with them and so that's what I

818
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:37,048
did I actually went out and found my

819
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:39,538
extremely well seasoned heart and like

820
00:30:37,048 --> 00:30:41,038
old-school IBM er who designed you know

821
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:43,650
anti-money laundering software for the

822
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:46,319
FBI and the Department of Defense and

823
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:48,480
designed transaction systems for for you

824
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:50,460
know Wells Fargo and Bank of America and

825
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,470
he was you know hanging out at fintechs

826
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:55,288
of FinTech meetups and things like that

827
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:56,970
and so in the Bay Area meetups can be a

828
00:30:55,288 --> 00:30:59,099
powerful tool for you actually to find

829
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:00,990
people who have those those core

830
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:03,178
interests and you know almost everybody

831
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:05,279
in the bay has fantastic chops in terms

832
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:08,038
of like engineering and computer science

833
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,329
so going to those places and having a

834
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:11,308
co-founder with you so that they see

835
00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:13,189
that it's not just you so it doesn't

836
00:31:11,308 --> 00:31:15,418
feel like they're taking as much of a

837
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:17,610
you may have to go to that party to meet

838
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:19,470
the co-founder though yeah yeah that's

839
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:23,189
exactly what I did just advocate exactly

840
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:25,589
what I did and you know it's it's again

841
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:27,630
like you say the passion has to be there

842
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:29,158
the the underlying story for why you're

843
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:31,169
doing this has to be there it has to be

844
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:34,110
really important and you need to be

845
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:35,850
talking about grander vision but it's

846
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:37,109
one of those things that's that is much

847
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:39,058
easier for people to get around when

848
00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:40,709
they start seeing multiple people that

849
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:43,980
are on your team so they're like oh oh

850
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:44,548
this is real I need to let you guys off

851
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,970
the loser

852
00:31:44,548 --> 00:31:51,168
over and out of time I'm so sorry one

853
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:51,169
