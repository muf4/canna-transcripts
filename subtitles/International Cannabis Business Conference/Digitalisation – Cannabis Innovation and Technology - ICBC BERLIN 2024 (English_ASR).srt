I've also had a lovely conversation with

19
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:34,599
Yogen that's uh still not been published

we'll start just with a brief

22
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,159

distributor

58
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,479
uh started in

59
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:07,719
2014 and uh we've been very fortunate to

60
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:10,439
be coupled with Cel and uh here we are

61
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:12,759
great hi uh Nick terab barelli with the

62
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:15,280
paxum group we're a manufacturer of

63
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:18,120
Automated Packaging Systems we have

64
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,680
facilities in uh Canada the us as well

65
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,439
as Europe so for for about the last

66
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,319
eight years we've been manufacturing uh

67
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:28,239
automated solutions for the Cannabis

68
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:30,039
industry with about 300 installations uh

69
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,480
globally

70
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:34,639
okay great so you know obviously we have

71
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,199
few guests across the the value chain

72
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:40,119
which is really good from uh extraction

73
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,039
to devices to uh post harvesting

74
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,759
harvesting on that note maybe we can

75
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:45,400
start with automation because I think

76
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,959
that's a big one in the space and

77
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,400
there's a lot of innovation going on

78
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,199
there and maybe Nick we could start with

79
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,000
you I mean how are you using automation

80
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,238
uh in paxum I was I was hoping I was

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,120
going to be the second or the third

82
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,920
question but perfect um so we I mean

83
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,640
being here in Europe it it's actually I

84
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:05,839
mean it's been fantastic we we received

85
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:07,958
uh a very large order a couple weeks ago

86
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,200
in in the Netherlands uh for a large

87
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,360
installation that we're going to be

88
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,560
installing in the next few months um for

89
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,840
us you know it's been a a a learning

90
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,680
experience understanding what's

91
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,319
important here for the European market

92
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,079
uh We've installed several hundred

93
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,240
systems throughout Canada and the US

94
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,639
over the last eight years predominantly

95
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,600
starting in whe filling pouch filling uh

96
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,120
jar filling as well as pre-roll

97
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,240
automation

98
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,399
um so you know everything begins with a

99
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,759
project or an application and and

100
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:38,879
typically we're following the lead of

101
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,600
our client base and understanding what

102
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:44,279
their needs are um how much product do

103
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,520
they need to produce what formats and uh

104
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:52,519
the nuances of uh child safety and um

105
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:54,399
their marketing per se great great and I

106
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:55,799
mean have you noticed so you said you

107
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,560
just started working with some clients

108
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,840
here in Europe I mean some of the trends

109
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,600
especially when it comes to Automation

110
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:03,038
in the US I mean and also Canada have

111
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,400
you noticed some of that also over in

112
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:05,519
Europe or do you think we're you know

113
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,239
there different problems that you need

114
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,839
to address I think uh we are far more

115
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,759
similar than we are different um you

116
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:14,439
know really the delivery process of the

117
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,280
product whether it's a pre-roll a pouch

118
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:18,519
or a jar is incredibly similar in fact

119
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:22,719
there was a lot of booths here at the

120
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:24,959
show selling packaging and um uh you

121
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,840
know it's essentially the same which

122
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,399
makes it I I think uh the transition

123
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,599
much easier for an automation company

124
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:32,719
like ourselves so I think you know

125
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,479
really when you're starting with the

126
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,560
client everyone has the same uh concern

127
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:40,079
and the same needs in in Automation in

128
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,600
the Cannabis space um reduction of

129
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,560
giveaway accuracy is of the highest

130
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,319
importance uh how do you maintain your

131
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,478
margin how do you keep your margin not

132
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:52,400
give away your margin um but moving into

133
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,959
you know the actual styles of packaging

134
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:58,638
very very similar um and then again what

135
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:01,198
a focus of uh serialization and child

136
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,560
safety okay great any other question

137
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,079
maybe on to you cuz I know I mean

138
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,879
extraction has moved you know Leaps and

139
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:07,800
Bounds in in recent years and I think

140
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,279
you know we could probably have a whole

141
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,639
panel discussion just on extraction

142
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:13,879
alone but still sticking to automation I

143
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,759
mean how have you managed to to

144
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:19,199
integrate automation into your

145
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,879
extraction system so um when we look at

146
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,560
Automation in general I'll take a step

147
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,959
back here and see if you could divide it

148
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,519
into automation Technologies for the

149
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:30,159
extraction and processing space so this

150
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,879
is from C to sale when say you cultivate

151
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,240
a product you're growing you have the

152
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:37,159
traceability of uh the seed and the

153
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,000
genetics Etc from there on to uh Pick

154
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,520
and Pack solutions for using robots to

155
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,240
separate out the flower that goes into

156
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:47,399
say convection heating or cold Heating

157
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,079
and then gets Mill into the product

158
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:52,038
based on the client requirement uh or

159
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:55,159
goes into extraction per se and then the

160
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:56,878
use of uh new technologies like butane

161
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,360
that are come around the block and old

162
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,080
technologies that like CO2 extraction

163
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,439
that have been around in the other Hubb

164
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:07,000
and spice space that are being utilized

165
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:09,240
in cannabis so um that's it's been used

166
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
we've been tying up uh there's a lot of

167
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,240
use of uh machine learning and

168
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,439
artificial intelligence where there has

169
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,319
been use of Scara systems and recipe

170
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:20,680
Management systems that uh not only

171
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,879
improve patient safety better

172
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,439
traceability and also uh reduce uh the

173
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,800
waste so it's essential for Waste

174
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,800
Management where all of this data is

175
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,918
being logged and you can reduce the

176
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,280
waste of particular Harvest and then

177
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:36,198
reuse them and then that's a whole new

178
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:38,000
industry of what's coming out of uh the

179
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,520
recreational medicinal and the

180
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,918
neutraceutical space and cannabis so

181
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:44,279
throughout the whole space and then in

182
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,158
the end as Nick mentioned is use of

183
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,399
robots it's robots technology for

184
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:50,240
packaging Solutions Etc so automation is

185
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,878
not just being used from on the

186
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,000
extraction space but the whole value

187
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:56,280
chain has been using Automation in

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,120
different faces and the data is

189
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:01,318
essential there to be used using

190
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,720
blockchain or AI so that um the data is

191
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,319
uninterrupted not U maintained across

192
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,520
the board and increases safety and uh

193
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,360
better waste management so okay wow

194
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,799
there in a nutshell there so basic yes

195
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,520
I'd like to jump in also on automation I

196
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,598
know where the Vape industry has come

197
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:18,839
from back in

198
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:22,360
20024 um where everything was manually

199
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:24,439
made now automation is now a standard

200
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,038
for sees cell in now we're in Indonesia

201
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:28,680
with 100% Automation and it's really

202
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:31,158
been incredible to see the lack of

203
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,879
failures you know uh getting to the

204
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:36,038
point where the cartridge is so dialed

205
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:38,879
in um for the end user the lack of

206
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:40,718
failures and the uh reliability has

207
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,599
really come tenfold from where it was 10

208
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,120
years ago streamline the whole process

209
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,519
absolutely yeah yeah y I don't know if

210
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,399
you have anything to add on on that

211
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:51,879
front Yeah in our case automation um is

212
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,480
mainly happening of course in on

213
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:56,360
production facility and of course we

214
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,440
several steps like uh welding soldiering

215
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,919
fully automatized stock system is fully

216
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,399
automatized so of course you rely on a

217
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:05,719
lot of automatized uh processes to be

218
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,720
able to really have a high quality uh

219
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,839
output yeah that makes s that makes

220
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,040
sense I mean all right let's stick with

221
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:14,360
you jogen so I mean I know that you know

222
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:16,360
and also Chris especially you're

223
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,120
leveraging a lot of technology and you

224
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,879
know trying to enhance the Cannabis user

225
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,240
experience uh so I was just wondering

226
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:26,000
you know how do you actually you know

227
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,320
leverage technology and actually

228
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,519
integrate it into a device you know

229
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:35,000
without I guess mitigating uh or without

230
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:38,120
upsetting the sort of end user

231
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,958
experience yeah of course uh on the one

232
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,639
hand of course that the the the consumer

233
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:45,399
nowadays uh is expecting really a high

234
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,439
technology device and he wants also to

235
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:50,159
customize the device and at the same

236
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,760
time he wants to have a simple use of

237
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,600
the device yeah so so many times you

238
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,439
have device where you have like this in

239
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,720
our case the craft you have a one button

240
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,640
device you know and uh uh just a the

241
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,240
user uses one button hits up and when he

242
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:06,958
gets green he can can inhale and but at

243
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,440
the same time you need to have uh um

244
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,958
also uh personalization and this we are

245
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,160
realizing via an app you know where you

246
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:16,239
can personalize your experience yeah

247
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,078
depending on the on the device like with

248
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,799
the volcano you can even make your own

249
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:21,439
workflows you know certain temperature

250
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:23,639
for certain time and then you go up with

251
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,800
the temperature and you can many people

252
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:28,039
are experienc with their tpine profiles

253
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:32,359
and and doing things like that so the

254
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:35,039
the web app also allows you to uh uh uh

255
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,839
to get a statistic about your your usage

256
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,439
yeah you can also uh access a lot of

257
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,200
information and uh today we have for

258
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,600
example for for the V we have released

259
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,440
our first time um an over the a update

260
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,240
you know what you can can use we have

261
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,920
never done this so so far before you

262
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,519
know so over the a update is also uh

263
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,879
interesting technology where you have to

264
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:57,679
be a little bit careful that everything

265
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:59,679
works out if you roll it out for 10

266
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,439
thousands of people yeah but so we have

267
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,799
done it uh the first time and of course

268
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,079
then you can also add on uh uh

269
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:08,199
technology yeah in this regard so this

270
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:12,319
on the on the on the consumer side on

271
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:14,320
the on the usability side of the uh of

272
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,320
the devices and of course on the

273
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,079
construction of the devices also if you

274
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,160
look here to the vendan technology you

275
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:23,359
see um there's a flow meter a r uh

276
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:25,719
sophisticated flow meter built in where

277
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,600
we can really uh adjust uh the

278
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,399
temperature control uh to the draw of

279
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,480
the uh to draw strength of the consumer

280
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:36,879
you know and this gives uh then a really

281
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:39,200
extremely equal uh reparation because

282
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:42,000
extremely equal temperature and this uh

283
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,639
uh leads then to a to a very good taste

284
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,120
to a very good uh uh consumer uh uh

285
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,799
experience so I would say today

286
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,600
technology is all over the place you

287
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,719
know it's it's in your production it's

288
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,600
in your device it's in the device of the

289
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,879
consumer you know and it's it's

290
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,800
obviously complicated because of course

291
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:01,200
you have to have it uh let's say under

292
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,759
control it's the because yeah with every

293
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,040
device it's get getting more complicated

294
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:08,159
but yeah it's uh extremely important at

295
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:09,879
the same time there are so sophisticated

296
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,360
tools you can use today so it's really

297
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:14,399
great to be able to offer uh uh this

298
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,079
technology to the consumers no I mean

299
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,799
absolutely I mean I'll come to you Chris

300
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:20,879
I mean technology is great you know full

301
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,078
stop when it works when it doesn't

302
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:23,759
obviously it's a bit of a different

303
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:25,519
story you know and it does add levels of

304
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,039
complexity but obviously you're trying

305
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,799
to make it as simple as possible for the

306
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,879
end user right so Chris that was

307
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,919
actually great segue because for us it's

308
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,240
about building Brands right and when

309
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,319
you're building a brand like everyone in

310
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,720
this room when you're building your

311
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,600
brand and you have your oil and you

312
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,920
spent years perfecting your oil the

313
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,720
number one thing you want to do is you

314
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:44,919
want to put it in a quality device

315
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,199
that's going to deliver for your patient

316
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:49,319
and not only have the best experience

317
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:51,519
but be the safest as well so I think

318
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,320
that you know we at at three win and C

319
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,198
cell we've spent many years with our

320
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,360
technology and just driving to have the

321
00:12:57,198 --> 00:13:02,958
perfect vaporizer for your for your oil

322
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,959
and uh we have a research lab in scel

323
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:07,838
Arizona and we actually spend even more

324
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:10,359
time on that um really dialing in your

325
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,120
oil to the perfect vaping experience

326
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,120
making sure that the resistance and the

327
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,639
ohms and every part of the device is

328
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,320
dialed into your oil because everyone's

329
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:20,919
oil is so different right um everyone

330
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,519
has the best oil right and and but we to

331
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:25,958
dial it into what is best about your oil

332
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,959
is what we we we strive for and we've

333
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:29,719
been extremely successful at that and

334
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:31,518
that's why I think that you know the Cur

335
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,959
Leafs and the true Leafs and the Cresco

336
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,278
and the largest brands in the world are

337
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,838
all sea Cale because we feel like they

338
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:39,519
know wow if we're going to put our name

339
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,680
on a on a device and we're going to sell

340
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,879
this device worldwide we have to have

341
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,519
that reliability and the trust factor in

342
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:48,000
that device because we're launching it

343
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,639
to millions of people actually I mean

344
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,399
how does it you know CU I can imagine to

345
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:53,159
make sure that you you know you provide

346
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:54,839
that good service and you're not ruining

347
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,519
anyone else's

348
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:59,720
brand pressure yeah pressure right and

349
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,639
like you know it's technology a lot of

350
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,079
R&amp;D must go into it I mean how does that

351
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:05,198
whole process look like you know how

352
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:07,039
much time and effort do you put into

353
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:08,958
something before you you know release it

354
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,000
out and feel feel that you can trust it

355
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:13,679
you know and I could speak for for Cel

356
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,440
and it's years you we start you know

357
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:19,120
when we have our calendar when we were

358
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,639
back in 2016 2017 we're all do doing uh

359
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,759
our things to 2025 at the time so it's

360
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:26,000
like a 10year schedule of how where we

361
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,320
feel like The Vaping industry is going

362
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,039
year after year and what's a new

363
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,759
innovation what's next you and for oil

364
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:34,679
like think about we went from distillate

365
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,959
to liquid live resin to rosin to liquid

366
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:38,799
diamonds so these are all different oils

367
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,599
with different consistencies and that we

368
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:43,198
have to build a device that really is

369
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,800
perfect within quite a short timeline

370
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,679
quite a short timeline as the industry

371
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,078
is changing incredibly you know from

372
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:50,159
country to country from state to state

373
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:53,078
with different regulations so it's a

374
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,799
challenge yeah to say the least say um

375
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:57,599
and Nick was also you know with paxum I

376
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:59,838
know you you're working across multiple

377
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,399
different verticals and and you know how

378
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,279
do you know which you know what will

379
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:04,519
work for the Cannabis industry and like

380
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,000
what new technology have you been able

381
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:08,240
to integrate sort of speed up your

382
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,078
process so I I think what's most

383
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,959
important you know when you're when you

384
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:15,439
start any application or any project

385
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:18,838
with uh a processor is sometimes less is

386
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,600
more and sometimes more is more right um

387
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,800
You need to understand their needs their

388
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,560
their their

389
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:26,679
production and and the Outlook of of

390
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:29,479
their future business so coming back to

391
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:31,000
you know Innovation uh things that we're

392
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,240
working on um like you had just

393
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
mentioned it's constantly evolving right

394
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,720
you need to uh read you need to do

395
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,198
research you need to hedge um and you

396
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,160
need to um at times take chances and try

397
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:46,919
to lead the market right so we've always

398
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:50,078
taken that approach um if we continue to

399
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:51,838
lead and invest in R&amp;D uh our

400
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,318
competition should always be trying to

401
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,160
chase us so right now you know a lot of

402
00:15:54,318 --> 00:16:00,318
our investment has been in inspection uh

403
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:01,600
especially in pre-rolls um one of the

404
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:03,559
the I think the most interesting thing

405
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,278
about pre-rolls is I've never met two

406
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:10,039
people that could agree on what a good

407
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:12,278
joint is um that's Universal anywhere um

408
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:14,799
so we're starting to develop a lot of 3D

409
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:17,078
camera systems that will inspect uh

410
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:19,039
pre-rolls at at as much as 3,000

411
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:21,039
pre-rolls an hour um that could either

412
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,759
be hand fed or completely automated with

413
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:26,759
a pre-roll machine so we're focused on

414
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:30,639
um traceability a lot of uh printing on

415
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:32,839
bags it's incredible how much time um

416
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,480
and resources are spent putting labels

417
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:38,279
on your packaging so a lot of our

418
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,720
investment is um a real-time printing uh

419
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:44,120
direct uh connection to your Erp uh QR

420
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,519
printing as well traceability and then

421
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,959
inspection that's where we see the

422
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:51,519
future being um then on the packaging

423
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:53,599
side sure automation uh weighing filling

424
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,120
um and that's again coming back to

425
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,519
sometimes less is more and sometimes

426
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,720
more is more uh for us the way we look

427
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,360
at our relationships is that most of

428
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,399
these relationships last longer than

429
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,759
most marriages so you have to choose

430
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:09,160
well choose your partner really well um

431
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:11,119
uh because you're you're together um so

432
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,959
you have to start with a basis of trust

433
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,438
you don't want to oversell your solution

434
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,400
and then you also want to be able to

435
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:20,319
partner with a customer um with the

436
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:24,640
resources and the investment in human

437
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:28,359
capital training um turnover mitigation

438
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,799
so it's a whole you know encapsulation

439
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:33,079
of just different things but ultimately

440
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:36,240
it comes down to a partnership um and

441
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:38,798
choosing that partner well okay

442
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,440
yeah definitely agreed with Nick and

443
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:43,119
Chris and on the timing thing it takes a

444
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,000
lot of time and uh effort but how I see

445
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:46,879
technology and automation there's always

446
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,240
more upside than any downside to trying

447
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,799
technology over years and as a company

448
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,240
we've seen that in our systems for

449
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:56,400
instance a CO2 system where 15 years of

450
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,038
feedback loop has gone into it to

451
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,519
perfect it the way it is and we keep

452
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:00,960
investing it further

453
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,079
with hopes of saying heyy there's an

454
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,759
upside and the Cannabis industry of

455
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:08,720
jumping on it saying as it matures can

456
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:10,599
we be part of the the force of the

457
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,200
maturing industry and develop new

458
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:15,558
technologies that are um helping the

459
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,679
market grow so I think there's a lot of

460
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:19,279
timing effort and Partnerships that goes

461
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,440
into it important Partnerships I think

462
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,879
that's that's a a key key takeaway there

463
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,080
as well yeah and of course I think a few

464
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,159
of you sort of touched on data you know

465
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:30,199
and data is super important in this day

466
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:31,960
and age you can extrapolate so much data

467
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,679
but I feel like it can almost be

468
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,519
overwhelming you know and how do you

469
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,840
then use that data in the right manner I

470
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,400
mean how do you guys actually take your

471
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:42,279
data extrapolate it and actually

472
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,240
integrate it then into your company in a

473
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:46,599
you know productive

474
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,359
manner I feel like you're you have an

475
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:51,079
answer yogish no I mean the first thing

476
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,359
about data that there there's so much

477
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:55,839
out there yeah and there is no end to

478
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:58,079
slicing data further and trying to build

479
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,119
inferences which may make sense to your

480
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:01,918
business or product or may not at all

481
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:05,439
make sense and especially with the

482
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,120
Advent of um uh the buzzword as we speak

483
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,159
in every industry now artificial

484
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,199
intelligence machine learning but to

485
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:13,880
know their true nature and what data is

486
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,200
useful and what's not is very important

487
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,559
because many of times we've had

488
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,000
Consultants where you look at data in

489
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:23,759
ways where there is no positive impact

490
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,319
it's just an infinite Loop of an

491
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,798
analyzing and coming to no end so I

492
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,960
think I think key is to look at the data

493
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,679
that's relevant and then use the

494
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:38,319
existing Technologies for traceability

495
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:40,600
and for uh uh for safety and get those

496
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,519
automation points in place how it

497
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:46,199
applies to extraction processing is

498
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:48,558
we've had uh sensor data from time

499
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,480
pressure and recipes that are fed into

500
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:52,720
an automatic system and that's been most

501
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,400
useful in my

502
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,319
case nice um I don't know if anyone has

503
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,440
anything else to add there or I'll just

504
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,359
add that you know it's it's really

505
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,600
understanding what your client needs

506
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:06,158
sometimes you know there's too much data

507
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:07,798
and you don't need any of it I mean

508
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,440
ultimately at the end of the day you're

509
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:13,000
running a business right and uh one you

510
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,279
want to be in compliance two you or I

511
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,279
should say one you want to make money

512
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:19,000
two you want to be in compliance um and

513
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,678
and it's important to work with your

514
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,440
clients and understand and also coach

515
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:24,960
them uh sometimes you can just be

516
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,919
completely inundated with just too much

517
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,038
and it comes back to you know less is

518
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:30,880
more and sometimes more is more then and

519
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,640
then other companies you know they may

520
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,679
run their business um very analytically

521
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,919
and then others uh may have a different

522
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,880
approach so I think it's just purely

523
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,520
understanding your client base and being

524
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,200
able to offer offer Choice um and then

525
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:48,558
be able to take their Direction and lead

526
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,720
them down that path with always um the

527
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,399
understanding of of not overselling a

528
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,600
capability that you don't need because

529
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,400
that doesn't harness a long-term

530
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:59,480
relationship

531
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,480
no yeah and and just to maybe zoom out a

532
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,519
little bit you know and especially you

533
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,880
know Europe we are a little bit behind

534
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:06,759
what's going on in the US in the

535
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,880
Cannabis industry I say in the Cannabis

536
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:11,599
space I was wondering if you know there

537
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,679
are any technological Trends that's

538
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:16,879
happened over there that you can see

539
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:20,360
working really well over here in Europe

540
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:23,679
uh yeah just off the well if if I look

541
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:26,399
at like Canada yeah um or starting in

542
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,600
Canada we're we're Canadian based so we

543
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,519
had a nice Head Start about 8 years ago

544
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:33,240
when they had legalized I think the

545
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:35,359
biggest Trend that we see is uh price

546
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,400
compression right where the cost per

547
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:41,079
kilo was significantly higher uh same in

548
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,919
the United States and and it's forced

549
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:46,480
companies to have to be really uh

550
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,200
efficient um that they can't throw hand

551
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,038
labor at it you you just can't the

552
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,440
margins aren't there anymore I remember

553
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:55,679
early on in my career um it would be you

554
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,840
know overfill it it's all good we need a

555
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:01,519
gram go to 1.2 gram it's fine everyone

556
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:04,079
will be happy on on Instagram those days

557
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,400
are are over uh if you give away 20% of

558
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:09,798
your product every package you go out of

559
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,640
business um so what we've seen is is

560
00:22:09,798 --> 00:22:16,278
that's changed and companies have to be

561
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,640
really aware that overnight the price of

562
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:20,839
this commodity can can fluctuate

563
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,640
tremendously right so you you you don't

564
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:27,158
want to be in a liquidity crisis um uh

565
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,840
because your overhead is just so high

566
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:32,039
and you have so much human labor so what

567
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:35,480
we've seen is companies are much more

568
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:37,798
Nimble um and um they're trying to

569
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,640
repurpose they're already you know they

570
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:42,079
valuable employees in more meaningful

571
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,720
roles and and we've seen that as being

572
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:46,918
almost the biggest Trend yeah we're

573
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,839
definitely from The Vape aspect as well

574
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:51,320
you're 100% correct the margins have

575
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:53,038
shrunk so much over the years so getting

576
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:54,759
into a new market like we're in right

577
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:57,640
now it's really going to be interesting

578
00:22:54,759 --> 00:23:01,038
to see how that is diverted um but I

579
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,880
think that um in the US especially it's

580
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:04,879
it's not so much the race to the bottom

581
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,278
because you hate to always say that it's

582
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,679
the race to a amazing device that you

583
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:13,000
can rely on and if people can focus on

584
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:15,080
that I have to hedge that I'm in a great

585
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,359
device in order to carry my business

586
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:19,599
forward so although the margins are

587
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:21,798
shrinking everywhere around us I have

588
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:23,439
the reliability of a consistent vaping

589
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:26,839
experience for my

590
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,759
patience consistency consistency I I

591
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:31,079
would say maybe a difference also here

592
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:33,119
uh in Europe I would say is that uh

593
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:34,639
compliance uh is even more important

594
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,839
here in Europe than in the US in the US

595
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,200
it's not so much follow people are like

596
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:40,399
uh uh or our companies are always

597
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,360
responsible for them themselves and

598
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,278
there isn't so much uh from the state

599
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:46,399
side lot of Regulation only when it

600
00:23:44,278 --> 00:23:48,519
comes to liability so that is you only

601
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,320
want to protect your liability but not

602
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:53,558
uh not much further here in Europe of

603
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:56,599
course uh compliance on the device side

604
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:59,678
especially is uh uh much more important

605
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:02,639
you know you need to have um any kind of

606
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,840
uh U Norms you need to follow you need

607
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,720
to to to have approvals you need to have

608
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:08,918
third party approvals you know this is

609
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,600
something what you what you need here in

610
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:13,600
in the market and um of course in our

611
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:16,759
case uh we are still the only one who

612
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:19,359
producing medical devices you know and

613
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:21,319
uh one point I want I wanted to touch

614
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,479
it's it's important we have here now a

615
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:25,839
new legal system that's great and we

616
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,839
have still the medical system um we we

617
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:30,199
don't have concentrates at the moment

618
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,918
yeah we we we need we will see if it

619
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,159
comes over time hopefully yeah but at

620
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,399
the moment we are relying on dry flower

621
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,919
also on the medical side we are reing on

622
00:24:36,398 --> 00:24:40,000
dry flower and the dry flower you

623
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,799
purchase uh in the pharmacy at the

624
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
moment you cannot do anything with it as

625
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:46,599
a patient you need to transform it into

626
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,079
the roller joint or you need to make a

627
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:51,599
cookie or you can use a vaporizer what

628
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:54,639
is the only validated uh method

629
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:57,319
available and so that is very important

630
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,520
uh to have uh uh these kinds of

631
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:01,519
compliance these kind for appr approvals

632
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:04,398
and certifications and if it is not a

633
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:07,839
medical device you can also go go to UL

634
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:09,839
8139 a great nor for vaporizers you know

635
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,480
but where you can certifi uh your

636
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,839
devices but I think it is important here

637
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,839
in Europe that you show your customers

638
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:19,199
that you have some kind of third party

639
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:21,759
approval what shows the safety uh of

640
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,960
your device yeah now and of course like

641
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,398
you said it is a medically approved as

642
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,919
well which is really good and I think

643
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:29,479
it's a yeah yeah and and of course at

644
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,240
the end you you need a lot of Technology

645
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,960
when we have for technology to be able

646
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,599
to really uh have a medical device you

647
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,399
need for your traceability for your

648
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,278
whole production system you know you

649
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:41,278
need it for your clinical data you know

650
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:43,000
you need to show uh that that you have

651
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:46,038
really a clinical benefit that you have

652
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,798
a positive uh benefit to risk ratio yeah

653
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:49,480
you need it for your uh postmarket

654
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:52,679
surveillance to get your consumer data

655
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,599
bed so other client other uh are they

656
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:57,000
all satisfied do they understand

657
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:58,759
everything do understand cleaning uh uh

658
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,759
protocols do they understand how to use

659
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:04,480
it your manuals and all that so also

660
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:06,558
here on all levels uh uh you need uh

661
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,079
technology yeah well I think so

662
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:09,200
Technologies King I mean and you touched

663
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:11,599
on it and actually it's a really nice

664
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,840
segue to compliance and regulations

665
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,599
because obviously we live you know we

666
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:17,678
work in a very highly regulated uh

667
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:20,079
industry uh For Better or For Worse I

668
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,720
think for better but you know so

669
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,678
obviously that comes with its own set of

670
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,200
challenges uh and I was wondering if you

671
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,720
know and I think this can actually apply

672
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,399
to all of you um you know how what you

673
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,079
know how you actually address these

674
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:34,479
different regulations in different you

675
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:37,599
know States or countries and are you

676
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,720
using any digital tools uh in order to

677
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:42,839
help you know mitigate and control you

678
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,759
know understand that basically so uh for

679
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:46,759
us to work in Europe and we are an

680
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:49,119
American company to work in Europe

681
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:51,759
there's strict Norms around eug GMP good

682
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:54,398
manufacturing practices and that just

683
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:56,960
and and for flower it follows the who

684
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:58,959
gacp guidelines and it's electronically

685
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,038
available there's a a lot of tracking

686
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,679
that can be done on the user requirement

687
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:06,558
specification documents now so a lot of

688
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,240
automation has come in rooll for your

689
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,000
qualification of your equipment for

690
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,759
acceptance of your equipment the

691
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,839
coordination with the Auditors when they

692
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:16,319
come in to comply a facility if they are

693
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,000
say making pharmaceutical products so

694
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:20,558
very stringent Norms but I think they're

695
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
great because if a facility goes through

696
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,558
it and especially the kind of um

697
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,278
equipment high pressure equipment that

698
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:27,558
they're dealing with if you don't do

699
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,919
that you could be essentially dealing

700
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:30,278
with the high pressure a bomb there

701
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:33,159
which could blow up if you don't have

702
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:34,599
the right compliances in place so it's

703
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:36,159
it's been great how do we leverage

704
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:37,719
technology now it's everything can be

705
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,559
done electronically as opposed to old

706
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,159
days where you need physical pieces of

707
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:45,440
paper to do that and traceability has

708
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:48,600
become much easier uh with the Advent of

709
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,399
technology so it's been implemented it's

710
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:53,678
you cannot enter the pharmaceutical or

711
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:56,398
the API space without uh doing U GMP for

712
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,519
us as a equipment manufacturer okay yeah

713
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:01,239
like d mentioned that is that is the ke

714
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:05,399
obviously you have to be uh certified

715
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,798
and um the health of our patients is

716
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:08,678
something that we all have to be

717
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:10,440
cognizant of at all times you know to

718
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:13,159
have the healthiest device with the

719
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:16,200
least amount of heavy metals in the US U

720
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:18,080
Michigan is the top standard so across

721
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,038
the board in the US we just go by the

722
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,678
toughest standard possible yeah that

723
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,640
makes sense Nick I don't know if you

724
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:27,679
have anything to add there um from our

725
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,038
perspective you know it's really

726
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,720
important

727
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:33,640
to

728
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,480
research every new country or let's say

729
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,278
the US state but every new country that

730
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,919
you work in so for us we leverage uh we

731
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:43,519
have a manufacturing facility in uh in

732
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:47,159
Italy in SK we have Manufacturing in

733
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:50,359
Montreal as well as in uh Florida um so

734
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:53,200
here in in the in uh Europe we we very

735
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:55,000
much lean on our uh Italian engineering

736
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,919
force uh you know who are very

737
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
experienced in ug GMP uh CE uh in these

738
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:02,320
standards right and and no different for

739
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,359
when we work with our Canadian clients

740
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:07,038
in Canada um I think you know I mean we

741
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,359
we all live in a a Google world

742
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:12,000
everything is online um but you can't

743
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:14,678
plead ignorance you know you have to uh

744
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,558
take compliance seriously um it's

745
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:19,120
important and um and then again you know

746
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:21,278
working with your client base different

747
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:23,719
customers have different

748
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:25,398
expectations um different uh user

749
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,440
requirements uh but you need the

750
00:29:25,398 --> 00:29:31,879
infrastructure the engineering

751
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,640
um know how to to be able to uh remain

752
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,760
in compliance so especially in this

753
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:39,559
industry pharmaceutical uh nutriceutical

754
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:40,599
to a certain extent um is the cost of

755
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:44,278
doing

756
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:46,038
business um I'd like to add to that and

757
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:48,679
especially with the Cannabis industry

758
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:51,000
being in a unique spot because we are

759
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:52,840
constantly intersecting with the food

760
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,480
and beverage industry with the Pharma

761
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:58,720
space with the uh with the neutral space

762
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,960
the topical space and the recreational

763
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,640
space so these Norms are in place

764
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,360
already but as as the industry grows

765
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,519
because of the taboo that cannabis held

766
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:09,879
before it became legal the Norms have

767
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:11,798
existed it's just about us picking them

768
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,519
up in each of our own companies and

769
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:15,519
being responsible enough to follow those

770
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:16,960
Norms so there's no adment of new Norms

771
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:19,880
here it's just that we pick up the right

772
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,880
ones when we enter a new country and GMP

773
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,320
authorities for the pharmaceutical space

774
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,480
have been kind enough that you would

775
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:26,879
have a different version of that in

776
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,919
South Africa versus Europe versus say

777
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,360
Morocco or or the us but at the end of

778
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:31,480
the day they're all the saying the same

779
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:34,278
thing

780
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:36,000
okay yeah maybe to add to this I think

781
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:38,519
it's important that also the Cannabis

782
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,839
sector is really compliant with with the

783
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:42,759
normal rules they are available and does

784
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:44,678
not go a direction to say okay because

785
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:46,679
it's cannabis we can make a workaround

786
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:48,720
or we can be less compliant or anything

787
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:50,519
like that I think this is uh is the

788
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,399
wrong the wrong approach many times it

789
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:54,038
happens it happens even to Regulators

790
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:55,959
that they're saying oh it's Canabis you

791
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:58,038
can use this device or you can use that

792
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,798
and even the regulator itself approaches

793
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:02,398
it differently and um so so like you see

794
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:03,960
in Australia in the moment with the we

795
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:06,278
band and they say okay we do some

796
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:09,159
medical devices with a with a two-page

797
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:11,159
uh uh uh approval there you just that's

798
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:13,799
not possible that I feel it's not

799
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:16,679
correct we must comply as as any other

800
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:19,038
industry also complies because only with

801
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:21,080
this approach we will get the acceptance

802
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:23,398
we need for a future positive

803
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:26,558
development and and more ease of access

804
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:27,959
for the consumers and patients no 100%

805
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:29,038
And I I would actually even like to add

806
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,880
something also when it comes to

807
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:32,319
marketing you have to be super careful

808
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,519
what you do and don't say you know it's

809
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:36,038
very easy to get red flagged and I think

810
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:37,679
in this day day and age of you know

811
00:31:36,038 --> 00:31:39,720
cancel culture if you do one wrong thing

812
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,360
you can get into a lot of trouble just

813
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,480
by writing the wrong thing so I mean

814
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:45,678
also we use different digital tools to

815
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,360
ensure you know which territory what you

816
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,200
can and cannot say and I think that's

817
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:50,359
also very very important because you

818
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,038
know you talk about the software the

819
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:54,038
hardware but even when it comes to

820
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:56,359
branding you have to be really careful

821
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:57,960
you know you don't you don't uh say

822
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:59,158
something or do something wrong there

823
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,240
great I mean we only have a few minutes

824
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:02,880
so I was thinking maybe we could uh if

825
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,480
anyone has any questions from the floor

826
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:09,039
now would be a good

827
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:11,519
time yes of course anyone have

828
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:15,119
questions come

829
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,549
on really one question just a second

830
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:17,278
thank you

831
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:19,398
[Music]

832
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:22,038
for first of all thank you guys very

833
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:24,798
much my name is nesa and I wanted to uh

834
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:26,839
ask Chris a little more about the uh the

835
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:28,000
point about Michigan is a standard yes

836
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:29,720
because we talk a lot of these conver

837
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,240
ations about top down standards what are

838
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,600
the opportunities for a bottom up

839
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,798
approach for some of these kind of

840
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,839
successful submarkets to teach and

841
00:32:35,798 --> 00:32:39,038
inform Regulators at a national

842
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:42,278
International level to help us move

843
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:44,319
forward together that's a great question

844
00:32:42,278 --> 00:32:45,798
um so when we're doing our Innovation

845
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:47,638
and we're doing our technology and

846
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:51,278
making Vape devices you know everything

847
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:53,719
being uh food grade medical grade um we

848
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:56,079
just go by the top standard so as far as

849
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,319
the standards changing in the future I

850
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:59,398
would assume that they're going off to

851
00:32:57,319 --> 00:33:03,079
the top stand standard uh to be more

852
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:05,119
compliant but the levels are so low um

853
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:07,678
that it's almost impossible to get too

854
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:09,479
much lower than where they are um but as

855
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,759
far as the bottom approach I'm not quite

856
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:16,200
understanding um what you're asking as

857
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:19,240
far as that goes as far as uh I mean is

858
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:22,120
yeah what I mean is if the if

859
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:24,679
the best example of a regulatory

860
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:26,439
standard comes from a a locality as

861
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:28,080
opposed to at a federal level could the

862
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,639
federal or International standards learn

863
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,720
from disclosure I'm from Michigan okay

864
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:35,519
AG could learn from that as

865
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,360
well yeah so I guess we can hope that

866
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,359
the Federal Regulation which will come

867
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:40,158
you know I think it's just a matter of

868
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:41,839
time before the US becomes federal legal

869
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,360
I think it it's on its way as you know

870
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:46,199
we now have 40 of the 50 states and uh

871
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:47,599
recreation's moving forward and and just

872
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,639
about every election there's new states

873
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:51,798
that come on board um so it's when

874
00:33:49,638 --> 00:33:52,839
Federal Regulation comes in I think

875
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:57,759
they're going to have to go with the

876
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:57,759
higher standard of Michigan yeah

877
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:01,200
any other

878
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,440
questions no how are we doing for time

879
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,918
you have five

880
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:14,760
minutes wow okay how some closing

881
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:17,679
statements or maybe some favorite dance

882
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:22,440
songs um so I mean ask I know big buzz

883
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:24,280
word is AI um I know I think we have to

884
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,079
you know we have to address the elephant

885
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,679
in the room and and yogish I know that

886
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:30,480
you you sort of touched on it and I was

887
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:32,358
curious if Buffalo extractions if you

888
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,559
guys are have integrated AI at all into

889
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:37,719
your uh into your workflow yeah so we

890
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:39,519
we've got the data as part of our Scara

891
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:41,918
systems and recipe Management Systems as

892
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:44,119
I mentioned so for instance if there's a

893
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,279
particular cultivar or strain that's

894
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:49,480
been used at the seed level that could

895
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:52,119
be traced back uh to the final product

896
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,878
and uh the data could be used uh

897
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:56,039
artificial intelligence could be used

898
00:34:53,878 --> 00:34:58,400
essentially here to fine-tune the

899
00:34:56,039 --> 00:35:00,279
cultivar further when it's going into

900
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,680
genetics so it's it's it's Crossing its

901
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,839
ways with genetic engineering there is

902
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:07,279
it how is that data useful for the

903
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:10,320
genetics of that particular cultivar for

904
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:13,000
Waste Management as I mentioned and also

905
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:16,200
um if you can increase the efficacy of

906
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,519
the product using that data so this is

907
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:20,679
this is in the extraction space um not

908
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:22,759
sure about uh the the post-processing or

909
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:24,199
the packaging for instance in robotics

910
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,880
there is it also intersects with a lot

911
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:29,279
of Robotics is in how can we um say can

912
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,559
place Solutions is and how can we make

913
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,760
them faster can we make them more

914
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:36,358
efficient so I think the key words in

915
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,720
the Cannabis industry are efficacy

916
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:40,400
efficiency and safety where AI can be

917
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:43,319
leveraged essentially at every part of

918
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,240
the value chain okay interesting uh even

919
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:48,400
yeah in I would say AI or in general

920
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:50,639
what we talked about uh uh data and what

921
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,760
you get out of the data of course we are

922
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:55,400
trying to get uh the user data of course

923
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,160
if people sending the device back if

924
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,720
there's something happening or if we can

925
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:01,358
get access access through the through

926
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:03,078
the app and then we really know how the

927
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:06,000
how the person is using it how much is

928
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:09,680
drawing it and we can analyze this uh uh

929
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,559
this data uh help with with AI and then

930
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:13,838
trying to really to see also on the

931
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:16,440
regional level of course we we sold uh

932
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:19,078
over 1 million devices in more than 100

933
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,318
countries in the last years so so of

934
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:23,560
course we have a global presence you can

935
00:36:21,318 --> 00:36:25,599
really say it's a global presence and of

936
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:27,318
course on the one side uh cannabis is

937
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,400
everywhere the same on the on on the

938
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:31,719
globe when uh I me the most humans are

939
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,119
the same all similar to but it's really

940
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:35,959
very interesting how people are using it

941
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:37,640
and what can you get out of the data

942
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,358
what you may not seen by yourself where

943
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:41,318
you need maybe an AI and what do you

944
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:43,519
need okay and what you can then include

945
00:36:41,318 --> 00:36:46,358
in your future development

946
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:47,519
projects okay interesting uh don't know

947
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:49,239
if you guys have anything to add if

948
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:52,400
you're using um I think Nick you just

949
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:54,598
did a course right on AI oh well I mean

950
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,119
on the Machinery side a lot of our

951
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:00,400
investment now is um you know machines

952
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,838
that I mean of course self-learning um

953
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,680
optimization but being able to

954
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:06,279
communicate with you about preventative

955
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:08,480
maintenance um you know wear and tear on

956
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:12,400
Parts when you would require to replace

957
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,318
them um so that's really important um

958
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,760
and then yeah I was mentioning earlier

959
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:20,039
that I that we received our um our

960
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:22,319
license of Microsoft co-pilot so whoever

961
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:25,079
uh hasn't used it yet it's pretty

962
00:37:22,318 --> 00:37:27,519
great fantastic let's just go to

963
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:29,440
lunch how about that cuz lunch is very

964
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:30,838
short today and so we'll take an extra

965
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,318
couple minutes let's hear once again for

966
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:37,279
our panel

967
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:39,480
fantastic and uh we'll be back here at 1

968
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,480
p.m. or 1300 hours depending on how you

969
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,000
do it so you got like 43 minutes eat

970
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:46,960
fast which is impossible this is Europe

971
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,960
take your time but'll be back at 1:00

972
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,960
all right we'll see you soon
