1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,740
how to open your mind to the future of

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,380
cannabis the founder of MJ Universe Lisa

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,298
Hogg

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,339
thank you everybody for the warm welcome

5
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:19,140
just to set some expectation this is

6
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:21,359
just some light entertainment we want to

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,179
talk about some different angles maybe

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,580
that need to be talked about more we all

9
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:29,518
decide on that so

10
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:31,919
um my name is Lisa Hack I'm I'm the CEO

11
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,679
and founder of mg Universe gmbh we are

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,300
limited we are a consulting company my

13
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:39,179
Consulting focus is mainly on Commercial

14
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:41,459
strategy and marketing strategy I

15
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:43,679
started in the Cannabis industry in 2016

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,620
but I'm also part of the board of the

17
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,840
German industry representation the B4 TV

18
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,839
I have a bachelor in business and the

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,059
German economics degree and yeah I'm an

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,300
entrepreneur in the industry

21
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:58,979
so before we get started and dive in I

22
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:01,979
have an open question to you in the

23
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:04,018
audience what do you think would be if

24
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:06,899
cannabis was something that was brand

25
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,520
new or maybe never illegal where do you

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,740
think maybe there are some Brave takers

27
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:12,420
and for some answers what do you think

28
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:14,039
where we would stand with the Cannabis

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,260
industry if it was something that was

30
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,340
just discovered

31
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,340
and he take us

32
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:27,239
I think that there would be more

33
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,680
clinical studies that have been done and

34
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:30,298
so there'd be a lot more research

35
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,240
because people would be interested to

36
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,340
see how this would affect us or how it

37
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:37,379
could help people as well

38
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,540
that's a great answer already I think it

39
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:41,399
would be a world sensation if cannabis

40
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,920
was never illegal or 50 or something

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,140
that was brand new and we have the

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,000
special situation with cannabis that

43
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,939
there is a huge research Gap if we

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,599
compare it for example to psychedelics

45
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:55,798
there has been continuous research with

46
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,899
psychedelics but with cannabis it's a

47
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,360
special situation that no research has

48
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,920
been taking place for over 20 years so

49
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:03,540
that's something that we have to catch

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,640
up now

51
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,618
um so I don't know many of you may be

52
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,878
new to the company to the Cannabis

53
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:14,759
industry but others they are um are have

54
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:16,560
more experience so the thing is we don't

55
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,299
see in the Cannabis a continuous growth

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,000
curve I don't know how you perceive it

57
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:25,319
but to me sometimes it feels like a wide

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,180
right on wild yeah yeah where it goes up

59
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:30,539
and down and curves and back and front

60
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,459
so it's a question are you just sitting

61
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:34,378
in that vehicle being driven around are

62
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,360
you playing a more active role are you

63
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:38,639
leading the discussion or do you lead

64
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,379
through actions and it's something that

65
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,359
is very important to say many people

66
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:44,098
that are leading the discussion are not

67
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,660
doing the groundwork and the people who

68
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:48,539
are doing the groundwork are not talking

69
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:50,519
enough about what the great things they

70
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:52,739
are that they are doing

71
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,560
so I think that it's all of our

72
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,560
responsibility to do and make cannabis

73
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,539
future proof we know what waterproof is

74
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,060
water doesn't get in what is to make

75
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:05,459
cannabis future proof is to design or

76
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,640
develop it in a way that we can ensure

77
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,199
it's a long-term relevance and

78
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:13,378
adaptability to changing circumstances

79
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:15,359
Technologies and trends we see a lot of

80
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:17,158
Purpose with what is happening in

81
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,159
cannabis a lot of people are motivated

82
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:22,079
through purpose and can provide some

83
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,719
value but we also see that a lot of

84
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,620
value is missed and destroyed or not

85
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,098
even

86
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,959
um possible to be captured because also

87
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:31,919
of the biggest trade barrier that we

88
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,200
have

89
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,139
um as in the Cannabis industry through

90
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:39,179
the global drug policy and by cannabis

91
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:40,500
being in the status of a narcotic and a

92
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,500
global level

93
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,539
so let's go a little bit into hype Trend

94
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,400
and mega Trend a hype is something that

95
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:49,318
is short-lived and Promotional and

96
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,219
something that goes away after a while

97
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:56,158
maybe CBD was one of these Hypes a trend

98
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:58,500
that we can see is something that is

99
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,539
developing more in the future a global

100
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,360
Mega trend is something that is changing

101
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:06,359
the Dynamics of our world I personally

102
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,159
believe that cannabis fits into many of

103
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,340
the global Mega trends that are active

104
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:13,318
today take individualization like that

105
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,299
you have individual medicine that is

106
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:17,639
something for you in the gender shift

107
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,858
discussion making cannabis more

108
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,660
accessible for women for example in

109
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,079
silver Society where we have a more

110
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,759
aging Society where cannabis becomes it

111
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:29,659
becomes relevant knowledge culture is

112
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:32,580
something about learning from each other

113
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,919
the new work is also something that is

114
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:37,800
impacted more through

115
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:39,659
through the Dynamics of covet also but

116
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,600
we are collaborating on a global level

117
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,880
we have companies working together from

118
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,500
Canada with German companies all on a

119
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,839
remote scale that is something that is

120
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,519
very Innovative and that is very new and

121
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,978
we have this topic of Health where I'll

122
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:54,120
go into deep deep into depth a little

123
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:56,099
bit more

124
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,259
um in a second the topic of Neo ecology

125
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,300
we want to shape our future we want to

126
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:02,639
make a little big difference the topic

127
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,680
of connectivity how we are all connected

128
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,680
with each other the topic of

129
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,900
globalization but also acting on a

130
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,240
global level Mobility has changed and

131
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:13,978
security needs are changing if you look

132
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,019
at the topics that we should maybe talk

133
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:18,478
a little bit more about in in that

134
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:20,399
context is for example Innovation and

135
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,019
Technology the role of innovation and

136
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,299
technology and how it's shaping the

137
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:26,459
future of cannabis including advancement

138
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,100
in cultivation techniques extraction

139
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,899
methods product development but also on

140
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:34,139
a highly technological level if you look

141
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:35,538
at for example new materials or textiles

142
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,100
and those kind of situations relations

143
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:40,439
we need to talk more about regulatory

144
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,360
challenges and opportunities the

145
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,918
evolving regulatory landscape

146
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,900
surrounding cannabis exploring the

147
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,819
challenges faced by the industry and

148
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:49,439
potential for policy changes that could

149
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:51,538
unlock further growth and development

150
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,579
but we also need to talk more about

151
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:55,860
social and cultural integration also

152
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:58,319
exploring how we can really integrate

153
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:01,379
cannabis into a mainstream society and

154
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,779
how it is impacting also various

155
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:06,300
cultural domains such as art music

156
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:07,500
Wellness infrastructure and social

157
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,560
Gathering

158
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:13,379
so intent like one of the biggest Mega

159
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,939
Trends is the Neo ecology humans are

160
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:18,120
looking to reintegrate into the

161
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:21,300
ecosystem Earth it becomes more not

162
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,579
Economy based on economy-based system

163
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,259
but a value-based system so that is

164
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:27,478
something that is changing also through

165
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:30,780
future Generations that maybe not here

166
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:33,180
yet but still in high school and that

167
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:34,679
they want to create a more sustainable

168
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,780
world and that's something where

169
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,819
cannabis can play a very essential and

170
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:42,000
critical role

171
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:43,560
so we have to get beyond the stigma that

172
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,600
is in the people's head there is a big

173
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,180
THC thinking barrier in the people's

174
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,400
heads so we need to talk and shift

175
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,680
cultural attitude change perceptions and

176
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,560
attitudes towards cannabis highlighting

177
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,019
the growing acceptance of legalization

178
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,478
efforts worldwide and legalization also

179
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:02,339
means removing the trade barrier for

180
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:03,779
medicinal cannabis and for industrial

181
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,579
hemp

182
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:07,138
um the medical potential exploring the

183
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:09,418
expanding medical applications of

184
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:10,800
cannabis on an API basis on Delivery

185
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:12,899
Systems and all those kind of things

186
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,418
that are things that take us beyond the

187
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:17,339
THC thinking barrier also about the

188
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:18,899
economic impact analyze the economic

189
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:21,478
benefits of the Cannabis industry

190
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:23,038
including job creation tax revenue

191
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:24,779
generation opportunities for

192
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,418
entrepreneurship and investment we just

193
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:28,859
need to get Beyond this barrier that is

194
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:31,500
in our minds

195
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,199
also something that I personally feel

196
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,699
that is a big big lack in is the

197
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,819
discussion about social justice and

198
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:42,000
Equity there has been a War on Drugs we

199
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:44,520
have to make up for the um for the

200
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,620
damages that have been caused by the war

201
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:48,839
on drugs and address the importance of

202
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,780
the historical Injustice related to

203
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:54,179
cannabis prohibition and also Advocate

204
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:56,098
to give something back through all these

205
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,598
things that are happening that are

206
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:59,399
creating Revenue that are creating

207
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,019
Prosperity that you give something back

208
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:03,299
to the roots so we have a strong

209
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:05,459
cannabis industry plant that has strong

210
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,960
roots and that can grow high and become

211
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:08,959
big and prosperous

212
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,900
um so and maybe also open the

213
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,538
perspectives of people to a certain

214
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:17,459
extent if you look at how cannabis is

215
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:20,098
perceived here in Germany uh for the

216
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:22,318
medical part it's basically your last

217
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:24,000
resort if you're very sick you may have

218
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,039
excess yeah but that's the wrong

219
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,360
approach it should like even if you look

220
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,519
at the definition of the World Health

221
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,199
Organization health is a state of

222
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,240
complete physical mental and social

223
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,060
well-being and not merely the absence of

224
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,639
disease or infirmity this area of The

225
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:40,319
Well of the health aspect we are not

226
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,019
even covering and we are not touching

227
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,360
but there's the potential there

228
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:48,480
uh here we see the master of hierarchy

229
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,399
of need it's not the lower lower aspects

230
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,560
like the safety social and belonging

231
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,958
self-esteem this is like basic human

232
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,539
needs but now we can see that there is

233
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:00,539
this trend for self-actualization what

234
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:02,939
do I do for myself and even the level

235
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:04,500
beyond that and that's what where I see

236
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,080
many cannabis entrepreneurs are

237
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,059
motivated is self Transcendence what can

238
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,300
I do for others

239
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:14,159
yeah and especially now we had this

240
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:16,799
discussion a lot here with the commodity

241
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,899
cannabis is a commodity we are not

242
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,699
necessarily the Cannabis industry we may

243
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:22,500
be just a commodity that belongs into

244
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,940
different Industries we have this raw

245
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,940
material aspect the pharmaceutical

246
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,339
ingredient aspect the fast moving

247
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:32,459
consumer goods lifestyle products and

248
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:36,060
all these that come out of that um

249
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:39,059
and but we still have the situation that

250
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:41,518
every marketer within us needs to stick

251
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:43,139
to their marketing segment then there

252
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,820
are some big issues arising through that

253
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:47,399
and there are some big issues globally

254
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,320
that we can we can talk about and we

255
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,759
should discuss so we can really educate

256
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,640
on these issues like for example with

257
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:55,620
the CBD is it a lifestyle product is it

258
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:58,259
uh helping to cure

259
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,000
um uh whatever they are and or is it

260
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:01,559
just a Cosmetics ingredient where you

261
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,299
can't really say anything so these are

262
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,278
challenges that marketers have in

263
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:07,439
Germany but also have in Canada have in

264
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:11,399
America and so on

265
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,880
so the only content in life is change so

266
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:16,799
I think it's very important that all of

267
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,899
us are working towards change that we

268
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,000
are lobbying towards a reclassification

269
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:23,339
of cannabis or even having it removed

270
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,080
from the single convention because at

271
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:27,000
least in my opinion it's still highly

272
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,339
limited through that and many things

273
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,620
have not not had progress at all for

274
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,660
example cannabis resin and flower in

275
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,759
Germany for example this affects us with

276
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:37,799
the CBD flower where it's still illegal

277
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:41,039
and we still have rates with the CBD

278
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:42,359
shelves because flower is not allowed

279
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,059
um there are many things that you as

280
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,039
marketers can do to accelerate this

281
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:48,539
change this may be about your product

282
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,278
features you may have exceptional

283
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:52,919
service you may have a very great

284
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:55,740
quality output or an exceptional skill

285
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:57,659
or very detailed information and all

286
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,339
those kind of things I think the most

287
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:01,078
important thing that should go on top of

288
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:02,760
that is Lobby work

289
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:04,739
um each and every one of us need to be

290
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:05,879
there need to educate Regulators need to

291
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,519
educate

292
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:09,838
um just also potential industry

293
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,000
stakeholders that are interested in

294
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,579
entering this industry

295
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,339
because what is lacking a lot is to make

296
00:11:14,578 --> 00:11:18,659
an educated decision on the things and

297
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:20,519
people have a lot of wrong information

298
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:22,500
in their heads so they cannot really

299
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:25,259
make an educated decision and to

300
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:28,578
educated decision should not only be to

301
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:31,559
uh to make get a better understanding of

302
00:11:28,578 --> 00:11:33,899
consumption of recreational Cannabis but

303
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:36,539
also maybe reconsidering hemp

304
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:38,039
regulations and see what barriers are

305
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:40,799
there that are necessary and that could

306
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:42,480
potentially be removed

307
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,578
um so one thing that I personally care

308
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,860
about is I do a lot of corporate

309
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:48,778
Consulting so um and we're here at an

310
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,579
investment conference you will hear a

311
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:52,860
lot unicorn unicorn there's no such

312
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:55,139
things as unicorn those in most cases do

313
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,120
not exist sometimes they appear

314
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:59,458
um so I personally would love to see

315
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,399
more zebras in this industry a zebra is

316
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:04,319
a company that focuses on sustainable

317
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,240
Prosperity Community quality

318
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,339
collaboration of a competition client

319
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,620
retention and success rather than

320
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:13,079
building hypothetical value that will

321
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,700
never be achieved anyways

322
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:16,739
um so I think this industry should be

323
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,778
more about long-term perspective than

324
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,659
short-term gains and I really think it's

325
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:23,458
great that we all come here together to

326
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:24,719
talk and compare and contrast the

327
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,399
different approaches to cannabis

328
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,920
legalization and regulation in different

329
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,958
countries but also ident jointly

330
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:32,939
identify Global Trends and potential

331
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,139
collaborations for research and Industry

332
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,680
growth

333
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:39,838
so I put X because it's what can I do

334
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:43,620
what can you do to

335
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:46,500
um to bring this change and so we can

336
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,120
finally be a global cannabis industry in

337
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,100
my opinion the most important thing is

338
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,500
education advocacy and thought

339
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,540
leadership that is in our every each and

340
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,700
every one's responsibility

341
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:59,000

hello I'm Francesca yeah um you touched

359
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:54,660
a very important

360
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:59,040
um well your point of view about the

361
00:13:54,659 --> 00:14:02,299
well-being of cannabis uh which I never

362
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:05,759
you know heard about I never heard about

363
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:08,278
well not from many people so I really

364
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:11,220
completely agree with you what would you

365
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:13,379
be uh your point of view about that if

366
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:16,079
talking about prevention perspective

367
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:19,980
when talking about well-being in

368
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:23,219
cannabis perspective and potential

369
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:26,339
what would be your idea of going in that

370
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,560
direction and cooperation or whatever

371
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:30,360
I think like we have this High barrier

372
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,099
with the narcotic which is in my opinion

373
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,200
the biggest trade barrier that should be

374
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,000
removed I'm excited to see how this will

375
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,120
affect us in Germany and patient access

376
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,059
in Germany also but I think that also a

377
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,919
lot of the products that are not in

378
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:47,278
their proper standard of identity yet

379
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:49,319
take the CBD products here in Germany we

380
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,600
have a lot of Lifestyle CPD products

381
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,579
they are sold and marketed as medicines

382
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,199
the entrepreneurs have a lot of issues

383
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:56,838
because of that the authorities come

384
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,039
they say where is your medicinal

385
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,720
authorization to sell it as a medicine

386
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,519
you can't make Health claims there have

387
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,160
been some very negative court rulings in

388
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,198
that regard also but there on the other

389
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:09,899
hand there are no proper products

390
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:12,539
available through pharmacies for example

391
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:14,519
for CBD that are with a full spectrum

392
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:16,919
extract because we have only isolate

393
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,379
that can be prescribed and we have the

394
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:21,479
narcotics prescription cannabis products

395
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:24,958
which also includes everything with high

396
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,300
CBD low THC but in this OTC there's a

397
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,759
big gap and companies would need to go

398
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:32,458
in there to also reap this potential

399
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,220
yeah and so and also another aspect of

400
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:37,138
that is to really

401
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:39,240
make create awareness for that that it's

402
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:42,120
not only the last Last Resort through

403
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,519
education for example that cannabis can

404
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,679
be used also as a tool maybe to prevent

405
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:49,198
illnesses or to

406
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:52,500
um yeah or as a just take hemp seed oil

407
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:55,019
could also be something for to prevent

408
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,120
um yeah to sustain a good health

409
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:59,179
once again agree with you it's a matter

410
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,879
of uh yeah

411
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:05,159
awareness about that and building New

412
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,759
Perspective yeah around that theme too

413
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:07,759
thank you

414
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:19,198
and we will start moving on okay our

415
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:21,979

416
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:21,979
and science
