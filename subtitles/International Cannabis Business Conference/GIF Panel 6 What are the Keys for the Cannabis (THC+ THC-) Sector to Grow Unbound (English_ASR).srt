1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
I'm gonna let these three kind people

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,819
introduce themselves so I'll start with

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,580
Todd

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:11,519
sure hey I'm Todd Bourne

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,759
um I am with MacArthur capital and now

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,679
currently the CEO at alpen group so my

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,500
background comes from

8
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:21,600
30 plus years into private Equity uh

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,000
prior to entering the Cannabis space and

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,920
private equity and Venture Capital my

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,339
firms managed about four billion dollars

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,539
in assets and then about 10 years ago we

13
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:36,119
made a shift into U.S cannabis

14
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:38,700
we've deployed between five funds that

15
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:41,759
I'm involved with about 220 million US

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,640
Dollars those have been about let's call

17
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:48,479
it 30 some odd companies invested over

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,280
five funds we raised capital from a

19
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,319
hundred thousand a person to a million a

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,140
person so it was a grind you know 220

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,020
million in the U.S space was a lot of

22
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,420
work to gather those assets I will say

23
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,640
we're very well known for a transaction

24
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,618
that we had where MacArthur put about

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,659
three and a half million dollars into

26
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:09,599
two companies that we merged into form

27
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,760
Factory we sold and had an exit with

28
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,298
that company in less than 12 months for

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,799
160 million dollars

30
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:19,920
subsequently our investor is quite happy

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,020
with those returns um but in the end we

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,759
have pushed all our chips in now and are

33
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:26,280
focusing on Europe the growth of Europe

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,379
the opportunities globally helping group

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,859
we consider ourselves an MCO a

36
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:34,259
multi-country operator versus MSO LP Etc

37
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:38,099
so that's my background

38
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,180
Joel hey Joel redelman so I've worked in

39
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,798
a

40
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,979
was the founding partner of Redfield

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,020
group so we're in alternative investment

42
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:47,179
fund and always looked at Emerging

43
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:51,179
Markets

44
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,740
Tech space cannabis space anything which

45
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,040
was a little bit on the Edge at the time

46
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:59,158
and now really focused on promethium

47
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,500
biopharma which is our cannabis play and

48
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,320
we've really focused on drug development

49
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,340
efficacy and how we can deliver a better

50
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:12,299
product and better access to patients

51
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,700
hi everyone Gerald decorser I'm the

52
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,739
founder a New Frontier data leading data

53
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:18,780

54
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,120
collection of firm in the United States

55
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:25,259
covering the Cannabis industry worldwide

56
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,020
a founding member of sea trust currently

57
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:29,939
introducing the first investment credit

58

rating and scoring and monitoring

59
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:36,479
solution specific assessing exposure and

60
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,099
overall risk in the Cannabis industry I

61
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,878
also sit on the board around carbon

62
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:44,280
which is a company out of India that is

63
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:46,039
doing research looking to understand the

64
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,840
applications of

65
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:49,979
carbonization of hemp for industrial

66
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,719
application

67
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:53,878
that's kind of why I asked the question

68
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:56,519
I asked earlier and my background is

69
00:02:53,878 --> 00:03:01,518
really in data collection analytics and

70
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:04,439
fintech which I now apply to canvas

71
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,620
well thank you all

72
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:09,900
I think I'm gonna start with

73
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,739
Capital has always been feast or famine

74
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:17,180
in this industry and

75
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:21,480
for so how can operators

76
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:24,840
be more proactive in trying to seek

77
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:26,219
capital and provide investors with the

78
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,500
knowledge that they know

79
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:30,239
so they can make investments into these

80
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,219
companies

81
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,658
I'll kick off with that I wish we at

82
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:35,939
least had a famine

83
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:39,299
in capital right now this is probably

84
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:42,120
one of the most difficult environments

85
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:45,420
I've seen to raise Capital

86
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,920
um for this industry uh and and thus for

87
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:49,199
us that's why we've deployed a lot of

88
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,238
our own personal Capital into what the

89
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:54,179
project we're doing right now

90
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,219
what I'm seeing though is is also let's

91
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,980
call it just from the fund level and the

92
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:00,598
investor base level the U.S let's just

93
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:03,119
call it all North American investors

94
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,859
have run for the hills it's just been a

95
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,019
complete disaster what's happened in the

96
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,239
U.S and I'm talking about not bad

97
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,120
companies in a bad environment I'm

98
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:16,379
talking about Good operators with a lot

99
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:19,680
of demand and and tons of sales uh

100
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:23,279
completely implode because of a lack of

101
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,379
banking proper Federal guidance

102
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,478
regulation Etc

103
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:29,339
so when it comes to Capital now let me

104
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:31,579
just be the investor versus an operator

105
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:34,679
for a second as someone that's probably

106
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:37,079
vetted and on due diligence on 500

107
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,120
companies maybe more than that across

108
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:41,459
all of the sectors that that cannabis

109
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,160
has to offer I what I see right now

110
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:46,319
Happening Here in Europe is the actual

111
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,540
right way to build an industry where

112
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,418
Capital markets can go into it versus

113
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,639
let's call it a gold rush mentality the

114
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:56,219
US and and Canada was a complete Gold

115
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,918
Rush mentality no realization of real

116
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,240
valuations all of that due diligence I

117
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:02,099
mean I remember the first deal I ever

118
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,139
looked at let's call it from the capital

119
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,240
space I got a shoebox full of receipts

120
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,699
and I thought I hit the the gold mine

121
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,918
for due diligence I mean now we really

122
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:13,500
are putting together a structure in a

123
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:17,219
Marketplace that can be Global in a

124
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,019
sense X U.S and X Canada of how does

125
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,080
really the market start to develop here

126
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:23,579
so capital is brutal out there but truly

127
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,758
the opportunity

128
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:29,459
that we see for massive multiple X

129
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,620
really is here now versus what happened

130
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:33,779
in the U.S and North America you would

131
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,819
look at at companies and and and and

132
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:37,859
valuations where you'd walk in the door

133
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:40,259
and see a 250 million dollar valuation

134
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,900
you know pre-revenue you know that's all

135
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:44,939
gone so we're you know I think we the

136
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:46,560
opportunity that we have in this

137
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:49,019
difficult Market is we're the real

138
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,300
winners will happen that's my opinion

139
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:52,918
but it's Capital really being brutal or

140
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,199
is it just asking the questions which it

141
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,599
should have asked in the first place why

142
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,180
why are you raising money again and

143
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,560
again and again without delivering on

144
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,478
what you said you'd deliver the first

145
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,620
time why why are you turning over a

146
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:08,519
billion dollars but you're not

147
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:10,379
profitable why what if if you can't run

148
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:11,819
a business sustainably then of course

149
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:13,560
capital is going to run away to an

150
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:16,439
industry where businesses can be run

151
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,418
sustainably and Europe has an

152
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,759
opportunity now to learn from the

153
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:22,318
mistakes from America and for people to

154
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,000
build businesses which are sustainable

155
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,039
like as an investor when you look at

156
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,199
things don't you say well

157
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:30,478
what's this money going to get you to is

158
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,800
this and when they said when a Founder

159
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,079
when you talk to a founder and all they

160
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,220
say is to the next Capital raise well

161
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,219
that's just not good enough right

162
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,180
in business business owners need to

163
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,978
understand that they need sustainable

164
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,418
businesses and that's what will keep the

165
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:47,519
money flowing and that's what will keep

166
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:49,859
things consistent like that and money

167
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,418
will come back to cannabis but cannabis

168
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,259
operators need to prove that they can

169
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:54,258
run businesses

170
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:59,279
the Gold Rush the green Rush is over

171
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,500
just just started like a proper business

172
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,899
like the industry is maturing

173
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,779
Germany is tightened up I can you know I

174
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:09,060
expect that things will be transparent

175
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:11,638
and sophisticated and reported and

176
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,500
operated in a proper business manner I

177
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,240
think that's pretty much it

178
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,279
I think a spot on I mean if you really

179
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,560
if you really think about it that whole

180
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:22,379
Gold Rush mentality green Rush mentality

181
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,199
what we might not be sitting here today

182
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:28,079
had that not happened in reality because

183
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,538
really then it was all in a sense

184
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,758
illicit market and so forth but the

185
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:35,219
problems that's continuing to go on is

186
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:38,699
really the economies that are built in

187
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,860
place right now continue to fester for

188
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:43,199
the illicit Market continue to fill the

189
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,300
coffers of really the cartels really

190
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,460
versus the businesses and Joel what have

191
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,680
you said I think is spot on when you

192
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:52,079
operate businesses as a business forget

193
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,759
cannabis just as a business as a

194
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,758
business as a private Equity investor

195
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:00,240
for 30 plus years that's exactly what

196
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:03,120
you have to do and so in reality all of

197
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,819
that gold rush and mentality and green

198
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,978
Rush that happened we probably wouldn't

199
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:10,740
be here we'd probably just still be in

200
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:12,779
the illicit markets so in a sense we can

201
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,478
think that but all the dumping of that

202
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:18,019
capital and I mean just irresponsible

203
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:20,818
dumping of capital you have to go into

204
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:22,620
opportunities now in an asset like

205
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:24,780
mentality so when we look at

206
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,180
opportunities you know we look at those

207
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:29,459
opportunities are are they sustainable

208
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,199
what's the path to profitability what's

209
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:33,240
the path to let's call it even Revenue

210
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,860
to profitability wouldn't you agree and

211
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,860
and why isn't it profitable now

212
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:45,199
what they said

213
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,760
so yeah you were um sort of going back

214
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:54,139
to regulation and

215
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:58,679
that how can these companies

216
00:08:54,139 --> 00:09:02,159
benefit from Smart regulation and that

217
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:04,259
lead to investors being able to look at

218
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,659
the industry that way I know you're

219
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:09,240
working on sort of what your project is

220
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:10,860
working on with sea trust but

221
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,440
so yes as part of

222
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,659
boyfriend to do I don't

223
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,839
really trying to introduce and improve

224
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:21,179
on standards uh standards by which we

225
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,500
assess risk and investment opportunity

226
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:24,539
in sort of a more transparent

227
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,480
quantifiable manner in a more

228
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:29,159
sophisticated business-like matter but

229
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,379
if we take that up you know a level

230
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:34,500
above Beyond just the due diligence and

231
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:37,439
financial assessment of risk

232
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:41,159
um how can regulations

233
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:44,100
help I mean how much time do we have

234
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:46,079
the issue I think is is not how much can

235
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,540
they help the issue is how do we even

236
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,220
get close to have an environment given

237
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:52,620
that the industry is a global industry

238
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:55,200
whereby those regulations really do help

239
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,959
to continue to Foster good business

240
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,000
growth and international business growth

241
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:02,639
in the Cannabis industry I'm not really

242
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,580
sure I have an answer to that

243
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,860
I have a lot of hopes and dreams though

244
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:10,080
yeah I think when you when you look at

245
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,019
it holistically we you can really get

246
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,180
lost in the argument between adult use

247
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:16,860
recreational medicinal and everything

248
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:20,039
else whereas the question we really need

249
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:23,100
to be asking is do the patience or the

250
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:26,399
users that need the product have access

251
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,720
to it and ultimately the within the

252
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,220
self-medicating market or the

253
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,139
recreational Market whatever you'd like

254
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,879
to call them they're they're really

255
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:36,199
quasi-medical users they are medical

256
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:39,240
users and they're not

257
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,100
they whether they're not familiar with

258
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,539
with the term that they're a medical

259
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,579
user and they call themselves a

260
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:47,699
recreational user

261
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:50,399
it's it's really by the way but the the

262
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,379
increasing medicalization uh within

263
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,940
within markets is a path to getting

264
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:56,458
access to the people that need it

265
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:59,220
without running into the pitfalls of the

266
00:10:56,458 --> 00:11:02,958
current uh regulatory environment with

267
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,959
um U.N laws and everything else

268
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:07,379
so a major difference and and and I will

269
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,120
say you know the fact of coming let's

270
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:12,120
call it from the U.S markets are now

271
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,919
being completely all in our fund and it

272
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,200
makes no more Investments really into

273
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,719
the U.S Marketplace unless it's more of

274
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,459
a global type of investment where it

275
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,820
where so we see what's happening here

276
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:26,099
the real reality is optimistically the

277
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,920
dollars and cents are enormous

278
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,139
that's not the issue the issue that the

279
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:32,699
companies are having and and and and I

280
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:34,679
always go back to it's very easy to

281
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,200
point the fingers and say oh well bad

282
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:38,699
operators spending too much money you

283
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,640
know we're unrealistic no not

284
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,440
necessarily way ahead first move or

285
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,539
David you mentioned that or first mover

286
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,040
is not where you wanted to be especially

287
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,838
in the markets and now if you're looking

288
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,458
at What's Happening Here in let's call

289
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,800
it Europe but I really look at it more

290
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:54,958
globally you know you know that's great

291
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:58,199
Germany Switzerland you know whatever

292
00:11:54,958 --> 00:12:01,018
this is a global Marketplace X us

293
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,879
because the U.S market is is really a

294
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,740
disaster and you can't even ship across

295
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,679
the state line let alone a country line

296
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,120
so I mean the real reality is now you

297
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,879
know you look at the tremendous

298
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,620
Financial opportunity is here how do you

299
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:14,639
build it and what I think is going right

300
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,060
here

301
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,578
is is really the slowing down versus

302
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:22,319
racing in and all of a sudden you know

303
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:24,299
you have a Marketplace that's there that

304
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,160
isn't ready for it and then it gets over

305
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:28,319
built and then things get pulled back

306
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,778
and then the taxation kicks in and so

307
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,480
forth this is a slow methodical approach

308
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:36,179
that's happening here in Europe and I'm

309
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,060
very very bullish on it so you know you

310
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:41,578
got to go in very light and and slow so

311
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:43,500
to say but if you do that the market

312
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:46,199
will build itself the you know market

313
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,179
efficiency is is 101 when it comes to us

314
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,700
in the financial world it's an efficient

315
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:52,919
Marketplace but with that efficient

316
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,778
Marketplace we know that the clients are

317
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:57,179
there we know that the use is there

318
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:59,278
whether it be a medical one-day

319
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:02,638
recreational it's one day recreational

320
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,720
so I'm tremendously bullish on it but

321
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,399
you're going to see a lot of Battle

322
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,259
Scars From companies that are just not

323
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,259
ready and prepared for the marketplace

324
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:16,200
so cannabis borders have always been

325
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:20,100
pretty um sticky as far as

326
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:22,860
what people expect and what what do you

327
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:25,820
think we can do to improve that in the

328
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,820
Cannabis industry

329
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:29,838
Michael means

330
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,040
I think it goes back to my previous

331
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:37,379
point about the medicalization of the of

332
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,719
the Cannabis market and if you can

333
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:42,539
create a framework whereby the medical

334
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,278
Market can expand though that the the

335
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:46,019
cross-border regulations there are then

336
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:47,939
facilitated through

337
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:50,578
pharmaceutical agreements rather than

338
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,899
through narcotics agreements and that's

339
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:53,819
a

340
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:56,120
that's that's a path that's easier at

341
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,120
the moment

342
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,899
when you say borders are sticky

343
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,000
can you elaborate on that because I'm

344
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,559
thinking of how we use that term in the

345
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,379
U.S

346
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:13,399
yeah I mean

347
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:13,399
obviously I mean I think it's

348
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,259
the the fleet free flow of imp of goods

349
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,639
right doesn't occur in the U.S for that

350
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:22,200
I mean other than the illicit market

351
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,039
right so you're talking about the legal

352
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,040
market right yeah

353
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:31,260
I think Europe has a great opportunity

354
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,360
to actually uh have uh let's call it

355
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:35,639
interstate trade that the United States

356
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,320
hasn't been able to do or take advantage

357
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,299
of because the fragmented regulatory

358
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,459
environment

359
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:43,259
um however I don't know that Europe as a

360
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:46,439
whole has figured out what exactly it's

361
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:48,000
all supposed to look like as a region in

362
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,680
terms of their overall role and their

363
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,659
expertise and how do they want to

364
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:53,039
position in the the market in terms of

365
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:54,539
how are they going to be that strength

366
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,939
in that Niche which is going to be

367
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:58,860
needed and then within that region how

368
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,440
is each nation that is looking to

369
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,839
embrace and sort of move forward with

370
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,760
illegal cannabis industry also going to

371
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,740
position and bring their own expertise

372
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,419
talent and Niche

373
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,879
so

374
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:13,620
a bit more to do and as my colleague

375
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:15,919
said it's a good thing that it's been

376
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:18,720
taken slow and and deliberate and

377
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:21,059
thoughtful process is taking place

378
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,000
because there's no there's no point in

379
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:25,799
rushing and and the US and North America

380
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,039
has taught us a lot of what not to do

381
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:31,559
but not necessarily what to do we're

382
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,838
still trying to figure that out so to go

383
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:35,278
to your border scenario and quite I

384
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,980
didn't quite understand the question so

385
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:40,019
that's why I passed them I got it I

386
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,480
don't usually pass on questions often

387
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,159
um but no I I think that the issue is

388
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,259
the U.S market you just have to remember

389
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:49,019
it's federally illegal still what

390
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:51,240
happens state by state is is kind of

391
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:54,120
almost by the way and accidental

392
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,159
another reason why we believe in the MCO

393
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,639
approach multi-country operating type

394
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,439
approaches you really have a scenario

395
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,539
Without Borders here I mean you really

396
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,339
don't I mean we don't know how that's

397
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:07,259
ultimately going to lay out because the

398
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,480
laws are being written and if I think a

399
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:12,299
lot of us smart folks in the room can

400
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,759
help contribute to to how those laws are

401
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:16,799
written we shouldn't have let's call it

402
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:18,899
a border scenario you know in in

403
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,000
addition to that really banking is not

404
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,559
an issue here the big banks are not

405
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,078
going to touch it right now because they

406
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:27,659
still do business with U.S banks that

407
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:29,939
might frown on on their ability to bank

408
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:31,500
cannabis but if you have a free banking

409
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,480
scenario you have a free Capital

410
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,539
scenario and you have the ability to

411
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:39,120
move across borders those laws will be

412
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:41,159
ultimately laid out we don't have the

413
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,560
stigma and the issue of stigma what's

414
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:45,480
happening in the U.S so in reality it's

415
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:49,198
an open canvas now but going back to

416
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,120
what Giada says is it's being moved out

417
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:53,219
very slowly and that's not necessary

418
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,440
really a bad thing we can all be

419
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,480
impatient for for let's call it for

420
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,579
returns and on our investment as an

421
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,620
investor this is all about Returns on

422
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:03,120
our investment I mean if if you're an

423
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,798
investor out there you know that if

424
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,179
you're someone raising Capital you know

425
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,179
you better know that so

426
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,860
I mean isn't that what the EU was for in

427
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:15,859
the first place

428
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,939
right

429
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:22,438
um

430
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,660
so uh

431
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:27,660
so so going back to that so what do you

432
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:31,740
think the most important uh factor in

433
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:36,019
the future is for the sector globally

434
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,019
if that's the if that's the case

435
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:40,038
Giada you want to go sure

436
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,940
I thought we were supposed to rehearse

437
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:49,798
these questions ahead of time

438
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,900
excellent question I mean I think that's

439
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:54,019
a billion dollar question

440
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,019
um

441
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:58,319
what is the biggest thing that we can do

442
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:02,119
today on a global scale to help the

443
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:02,119
industry well shizen

444
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:08,279
I think the first thing is to realize

445
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,840
that it is a global market and it is a

446
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:12,178
global opportunity

447
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:15,298
and to start from that framework so

448
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:17,880
whether you are operating locally or

449
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:19,200
you're an MSO operating Interstate or

450
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,580
you're in Europe and you're beginning to

451
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,319
think about how you're going to plant

452
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:24,119
your flag in Germany but then at the

453
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,980
same time work in Switzerland

454
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:28,739
you really need to think like that you

455
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,259
need to to realize that it's not just a

456
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,940
matter of where you are locally but the

457
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:35,220
opportunity and the challenges are going

458
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,440
to come from all over the place more

459
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,660
interestingly to me specifically and

460
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,400
actually recently wrote a little

461
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,679
something that may be worth a little

462
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,298
something about it is that we are

463
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,820
beginning to see the emergence of

464
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:50,639
regional expertise across the global

465
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:52,439
industry regions really are beginning to

466
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,860
sort of develop their own personality

467
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:58,500
and profile as it pertains to what their

468
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:59,699
role is in the whole ecosystem of

469
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,058
cannabis

470
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:05,279
and so maybe would be valuable for all

471
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:06,960
of us in the industry to again think of

472
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,178
our own talent and expertise and what

473
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,179
can bring to bear while being very

474
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:15,660
cognizant of what's happening around us

475
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:18,538
are a big macro level on a global level

476
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:20,340
my potential two cents

477
00:19:18,538 --> 00:19:22,500
yeah and I mean it's important to create

478
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:26,459
that we create an environment where the

479
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:28,440
the demand can be can be satisfied if we

480
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,120
we all know people want cannabis the

481
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,460
people are out there that want it but if

482
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:34,798
we don't have an environment where it

483
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,019
can be delivered from the grower or the

484
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,579
producer all the way down to the down to

485
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:40,079
the patient and the person that wants it

486
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:41,399
well then we can make as much cannabis

487
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,720
as we want it's just going to sit and

488
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,400
get old in our warehouses and

489
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,259
putting a system in place where we can

490
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,298
the Cannabis can be delivered to the

491
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:52,859
people that need it and drive that

492
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:56,400
demand is also is what's going to drive

493
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:58,379
the sustainability of our businesses

494
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,600
I agree with both of those those

495
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:03,360
comments I I think what I would add to

496
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:05,579
that is this

497
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:07,979
we have always let's call it at the

498
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:10,379
MacArthur level at my at my private

499
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:13,140
Equity Firm took the approach of to be

500
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:15,419
very collaborative and to not think that

501
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,700
we could either run any one deal by

502
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:19,380
ourselves take the lead and just do it

503
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,779
all by ourselves and then as we would

504
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:24,000
then do our due diligence on firms to

505
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:25,980
make investments in who would be the

506
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,980
most collaborative very difficult to get

507
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:31,980
in the U.S as you have that border issue

508
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:35,160
but to me personally what what

509
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:37,500
can now tee up the best opportunity for

510
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,919
the largest growth is for this industry

511
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:43,980
here to be a global industry to be very

512
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,720
collaborative because you know one level

513
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,279
of expertise may be coming out of

514
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,140
Portugal another might be coming out of

515
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,000
Switzerland another might be coming out

516
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:54,780
of Germany another might be coming out

517
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,339
of Columbia South Africa on and on how

518
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:59,339
did how does this industry now

519
00:20:56,339 --> 00:21:02,038
collaborate because it is one big huge

520
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:04,678
industry the difference is it's not just

521
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:06,480
a pure Pharma industry so even let's

522
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,100
call it medical can still have that

523
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,798
approach of how does that ultimately

524
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:13,439
become a recreational or an adult use

525
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:17,460
product Etc I think the collaboration

526
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,679
between countries companies leaders

527
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:22,500
within the industry will be how this

528
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,660
really can be an enormous industry and

529
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,519
it has to be a profitable I I would love

530
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,038
to say this is philanthropy it's it's

531
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:31,440
not I mean there's philanthropy that can

532
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:34,019
come from successful companies where

533
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,580
they can then make a contribution to

534
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:37,500
making sure that it's you know let's

535
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:40,199
call it is available to everyone is

536
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,720
available to people that need Etc but if

537
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,900
this is not a successful viable industry

538
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,000
there is nothing to distribute so at the

539
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,400
end of the day that collaboration that

540
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,500
unified philosophy is what ultimately

541
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,038
makes this a successful successful

542
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,038
industry

543
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,519
well I think that's all I have on the

544
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,840
question side should we turn it over to

545
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,839
the audience and see sure

546
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:15,659
Rocky had his hand up

547
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:19,319
Rocky petrulo one world Legends Colombia

548
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:22,440
my question is the title appears

549
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:24,538
um cannabis sector to grow unbounded and

550
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:28,259
I think Todd just did a good job about

551
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:29,460
talking about collaboration and

552
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:31,798
um you know

553
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:35,400
working together which means to me both

554
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:37,798
ways earlier today we had a panel that

555
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,419
was saying it is what it is the

556
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:41,759
government's only going to allow Germany

557
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:43,200
to grow in Germany well if we're going

558
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,779
to collaborate and we're going to go

559
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,960
both ways if Germany's going to serve

560
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:51,720
France or Sweden or or there's you know

561
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,298
been a pathogen that's killed most of

562
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,460
the product in Italy is Germany going to

563
00:22:54,298 --> 00:23:00,019
work with Italy or is Germany going to

564
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:03,419
only grow for Germany and not

565
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:05,940
collaborate and market and sell to other

566
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:09,360
countries so I think like you said it's

567
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:12,000
a big Global Market which includes you

568
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,879
know importation from Colombia as we had

569
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,099
a couple of people speak this morning

570
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,720
and I like your approach Todd so what do

571
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:20,879
you think do you think that to grow

572
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,700
unbounded we need to open these borders

573
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,980
you know versus America which we will

574
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,019
get there but the states had to move

575
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,659
forward because the federal government

576
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:33,000
was going to you know drag their tail

577
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:35,220
but now that there's 37 states in

578
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,599
America the next step is the federal

579
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:40,019
laws are going to have to change and

580
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:42,058
then we'll have interstate commerce

581
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:44,819
yeah I think you're exactly right that

582
00:23:42,058 --> 00:23:46,619
guy knew what he was talking about

583
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:49,019
I think you're spot on it so it's it's a

584
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:50,759
global environment it's it's a and and

585
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:52,200
yes if anyone's saying is it's all just

586
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:54,658
going to be your way and not the other

587
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,360
way that will be the failure that

588
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:58,740
happens all over again so I think I

589
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,658
think what the guys were saying this

590
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,279
morning wasn't that

591
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:04,080
we shouldn't collaborate and we should

592
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:05,639
work within our countries it was saying

593
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,439
this is what the government's offering

594
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,360
us now let's take what we can get now

595
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,798
and keep pushing for what we want rather

596
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:14,339
than saying it's not enough and getting

597
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:16,740
nothing and those incremental steps help

598
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:19,259
the market grow and develop and build in

599
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,759
every place to a point where governments

600
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:23,038
are willing to give more and they'll

601
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:25,019
they see that the negative effects of

602
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,839
the changes in the regulations haven't

603
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:29,279
brought but brought lots of car crashes

604
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:30,658
because people are driving stoned or

605
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,058
something else once they see that the

606
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:34,559
regulations are working then they'll be

607
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:35,940
open to more regulations and we're

608
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:37,980
better off taking what we're offered

609
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,298
than saying it's not enough the Joel I

610
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,339
agree with you I mean if you if you

611
00:24:39,298 --> 00:24:42,960
think about that all you can do is work

612
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:45,058
within the framework that you're allowed

613
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,038
to do it no one on stage is going to say

614
00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:49,200
we're going to be able to change really

615
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:51,480
that environment so I agree that you

616
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,759
have to work within the framework we you

617
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,860
have that being said it's one of the

618
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,259
reasons and Daniel mentioned it earlier

619
00:24:55,859 --> 00:25:00,240
this morning as well was that's why we

620
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:01,679
are in Switzerland you know I mean we we

621
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,079
we're going to be collaborative with

622
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,900
Colombia and markets like that using

623
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:08,939
what we have in place if you isolate

624
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,860
yourself you're only going to have an

625
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,360
isolated Marketplace I mean it is what

626
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:14,038
it is yeah and we should we shouldn't

627
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:15,658
stop lobbying just because we've got a

628
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:20,099
small step we should we should all keep

629
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:23,340
pushing right absolutely exactly

630
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:27,119
check check oh okay over here

631
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:29,339
a good afternoon thank you thank you

632
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:32,759
Derek Bill and metec farmer from

633
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:35,099
Australia on the question what can we do

634
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:37,500
for the global industry to move forward

635
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:39,240
one of the challenges I believe existed

636
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,419
in pretty much every single country is

637
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:45,058
driving under the influence of DHC at

638
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:46,380
this moment in time we don't have a

639
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:49,319
quantitative test

640
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,820
is that kind of test not relevant at

641
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:53,099
that moment to start to work as an

642
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:55,439
industry finding a quantitative test

643
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:57,480
rather than a quality test so that

644
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,600
people are not afraid of using the

645
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,339
product and with the risk of losing jail

646
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:04,939
or losing their license driving license

647
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:04,939
it is

648
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:09,839
first of all studies show that Stoners

649
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:13,139
are better drivers than regular people

650
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:14,819
uh the old joke slower correct well the

651
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,740
old joke is that a drunk person will

652
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:18,240
drive right through the stop sign but

653
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,900
the stoner will wait for the stop sign

654
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,900
to turn green

655
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,399
yeah I think these strikes are deep

656
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:28,139
Accord there which relates to the

657
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:32,240
misdesign of cities ever since the

658
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,240
invention of the automobile here here

659
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,200
Everything is Everything

660
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:39,000
yeah uh what can we do about that I mean

661
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,640
Washington state has tried to have a

662
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,019
default

663
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,419
driving Under the Influence law so if

664
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:47,038
you have five nanograms in your

665
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:48,960
bloodstream they can try to charge you

666
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,579
with driving Under the Influence but I

667
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,860
mean I have five nanograms in my

668
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:56,579
bloodstream just when I wake up in the

669
00:26:52,859 --> 00:26:58,019
morning so I mean is there yeah another

670
00:26:56,579 --> 00:26:59,819
thing where it's like an education thing

671
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:01,918
where we have to just educate people

672
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:03,538
that well it well it is but say like

673
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,520
Australia is a terrible example because

674
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:07,379
it was only a month or two ago there was

675
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,019
a fellow that was pulled over and he was

676
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,760
stoned and they

677
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:13,079
stole him not to drive and he got back

678
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:17,000
in the car and then Tebow and someone

679
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:19,980
and killed five people and so it's it's

680
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,659
not just given THC a bad name in that

681
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,940
situation but it's really changed the

682
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:25,740
public discourse was he just on THC or

683
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,480
was he on other things as well

684
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,240
I believe he was on a number of other

685
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,159
things yeah so but but that that's not

686
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,759
what's published in the headline THC is

687
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,679
what's published in the headline and the

688
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:40,819
if people aren't responsible then

689
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,820
they'll just ban everything

690
00:27:41,778 --> 00:27:46,500
uh you all were highlighting how

691
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:48,599
difficult the regulatory environment is

692
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,859
in the United States and Todd I think

693
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:53,099
you said for that reason that you don't

694
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:55,439
invest any capital in in the U.S not

695
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:57,538
anymore not anymore and my question is

696
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,400
do you see that changing in the near

697
00:27:57,538 --> 00:28:01,500
future and what I mean is I'm from

698
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,880
California for instance which you know

699
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,679
arguably has the most difficult

700
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,600
regulatory environment of any place in

701
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:08,460
the United States and by virtue of that

702
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:10,319
there are a lot of those first movers as

703
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,419
you were discussing are now distressed

704
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,579
and so there's a theory that you know

705
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:16,500
second movers might come in and

706
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:17,879
consolidate that market as the

707
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,558
regulatory environment gets more

708
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,659
favorable and they'll want people like

709
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:24,839
you right to to be investing capital and

710
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:27,299
just gave away my secret you you're spot

711
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:29,759
on I mean really the distressed assets

712
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:32,579
that are coming in the U.S and the

713
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:35,099
consolidation of of the industry and the

714
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:37,500
players you're spot on and and when I

715
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:40,079
say we're not investing in the U.S it's

716
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,919
because I think there's still a lot more

717
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:42,778
of

718
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:45,179
of blood in the streets before it's time

719
00:28:42,778 --> 00:28:47,640
to go in there but again there are great

720
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:49,980
operators there so I mean California has

721
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,380
some of the best operators in the globe

722
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,720
I'd hate to pay those taxes and the

723
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:57,120
state taxes and all the pre and in the

724
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,798
280e and all that's that's going to

725
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:01,199
change the Opera there's going to be

726
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:04,079
that Tipping Point of when that

727
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,058
opportunity is is there distressed to

728
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:09,178
them boom back so no I think you're spot

729
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:10,798
on I agree with you if I may add to that

730
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:12,419
it's true that the regulatory

731
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:14,220
environment

732
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,778
in Jewish shift for the better in the

733
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,700
regulatory environment would absolutely

734
00:29:15,778 --> 00:29:21,058
support

735
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:22,500
um struggling businesses but I think

736
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:24,599
that it's all at the end of the day it's

737
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,398
all about increasing transparency and

738
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:28,139
visibility into the industry and the

739
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,699
operator and the businesses it really

740
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:32,940
comes down to that so whether it is

741
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:35,580
catalyzed by regulation or just better

742
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,778
operation by the businesses

743
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:39,000
um I mean we're in the business of

744
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:40,619
distressed assets we know we we realize

745
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,940
that there are a lot of businesses out

746
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:43,558
there that are struggling and what we do

747
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,440
is we come in and we do what a doctor

748
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:48,898
does we give them a bill of health we

749
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,820
tell them here's your pain points oh and

750
00:29:48,898 --> 00:29:52,859
these are your symptoms but this is the

751
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:54,359
disease and this is what you need to do

752
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:55,500
to get better and then if you get better

753
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:58,558
your medicine is going to be more

754
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:01,440
capital and then you're gonna survive I

755
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:03,538
mean so I think we I'm not saying the

756
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,460
regulation is not critical I mean I'm

757
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:07,440
all about you know let's have Federal

758
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:09,840
Regulation and federal standard around

759
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,298
everything packaging dosing like a

760
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:13,678
transparency visibility but I think we

761
00:30:12,298 --> 00:30:15,960
also need to take ownership and

762
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,940
responsibility and accountability to how

763
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,679
we've been operating businesses in the

764
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,480
Cannabis industry as well and I think

765
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,340
it's time to raise the bar

766
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:26,099
fantastic what do they say the early

767
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:28,398
bird gets the worm the second mouse gets

768
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:28,398
the cheese

769
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,700
profound

770
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,740
my question is is primarily to the money

771
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,600
allocates can you hear me yeah you got

772
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,740
me it's to the money allocators on the

773
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:40,379
stage

774
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:42,120
um what psychology this is probably a

775
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,679
you know quite a pipe dream for Europe

776
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:45,119
at the moment but if if Europe really

777
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,220
does this right and takes off in the

778
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:49,798
right direction what's the right

779
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,720
psychology for operators with money

780
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:53,460
allocators saying hey we want to Pile in

781
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,319
now because you know because you guys

782
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,759
have seen that in the past what what do

783
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:58,740
you want to see from operators saying

784
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:59,759
hey no that's too big we won't take your

785
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,859
money because that's a very difficult

786
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:03,480
one as a CEO of a company say hey I

787
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:05,819
don't want your money I'm good where I'm

788
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,899
at so just maybe some perspectives on

789
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:08,700
that please yeah I'll hit that super

790
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:10,519
quick because I I think that's that's

791
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,080
the Tipping Point and the great question

792
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:15,298
I think all the people that kind of came

793
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:17,460
in and with a rush to Too Much Capital

794
00:31:15,298 --> 00:31:19,859
too quick overbuilt the marketplace

795
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:22,259
before there was even a Marketplace so

796
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:23,819
as looking and again I mean I'm putting

797
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:25,440
my own money my partners were putting

798
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:28,558
our own money into this company but at

799
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,140
the end of the day very asset light not

800
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,278
over allocating to Psy ways to

801
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,980
Marketplace

802
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:36,659
Etc knowing who the client is today and

803
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,659
let's call it who it's going to be a

804
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:40,919
year and maybe two years from now 10

805
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:43,440
years from now it's going to look

806
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:45,899
completely different also phasing your

807
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,880
way in I've seen so many you know okay

808
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:50,699
all we need to do is raise 20 million

809
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:52,740
dollars and yeah okay good luck you know

810
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,960
what are the phases that you can go in

811
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:57,298
do I need a million here 3 million here

812
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,278
in five and Joel not to the and I'm

813
00:31:57,298 --> 00:32:01,379
going back and raising all the time but

814
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:03,659
phasing in to that stage of

815
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:05,940
profitability okay we've got this we're

816
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:07,799
now moving with it now phase two will

817
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,480
kick in or phrase three will kick in

818
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:11,220
yeah and how many times have you seen a

819
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,019
company say oh we need five million

820
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,519
dollars to build out a facility so well

821
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:16,079
have you not thought about using a

822
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:18,298
contract manufacturer have you not

823
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:19,798
thought of someone else's facility that

824
00:32:18,298 --> 00:32:22,379
already exists like why are we building

825
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:23,879
another facility or we need a million

826
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,440
dollars to buy this machine it's like

827
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,778
well did you look did you look in the

828
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,278
auctions to see if there's anyone any if

829
00:32:27,778 --> 00:32:31,140
there's a liquidator selling one did you

830
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:32,880
look for a second hand one did you look

831
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,840
at least about leasing it did you look

832
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,880
of

833
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:39,418
there's all there's all these things and

834
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:41,820
if you if you focus on like like Todd

835
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:45,480
said asset light expense light keeping

836
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:47,700
your cost low then in lean times the

837
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,558
business survives if if you're

838
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:52,558
overloaded with costs then when when

839
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:53,819
lean times come that's where that's when

840
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:56,000
the dentist wedding just gets out of

841
00:32:53,819 --> 00:32:56,000
control

842
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,480
if I may add a very macro level sort of

843
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,879
comment

844
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,679
we've we've spent the past six months

845
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,159
interviewing investors lenders and

846
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:09,840
creditors to understand while I'm not a

847
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,100
greater investor or lender but we did

848
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:13,859
spend some time talking to them because

849
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:15,480
we wanted to understand what is it that

850
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:17,519
you know that that turns you off when

851
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,798
you look at you know an investment or

852
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,538
you know what's making you know what's

853
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:23,460
about performing loan for you what was

854
00:33:21,538 --> 00:33:25,980
that pain Point what what's the what is

855
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,538
it what is where does it stem from and

856
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,460
actually what we found out was that it

857
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:31,798
was a lot of

858
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:34,319
disappointment let's call it with

859
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:36,839
governance and management

860
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:40,200
a lot of it like it all no matter what

861
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:42,000
the symptom was that it came back up to

862
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,860
bad management

863
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,759
and I know that sounds sort of like a

864
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:49,379
duh but there you have it that's what we

865
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,940
literally did a survey and that that was

866
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,679
the outcome of it

867
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,298
you're a great one I like to see you

868
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:56,880
your Founders like putting lots of

869
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:58,619
photos of people in decks so the

870
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,080
investor think so they think the

871
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:03,119
investor sees it oh it's we're a big

872
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:04,558
business where we're going to grow

873
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:06,239
bigger we're doing everything else but

874
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:09,418
all investors look at that and they say

875
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:12,539
there's too much cost in this

876
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:13,918
they you have to be realistic about who

877
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:16,199
you are realistic about where you're

878
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,638
going realistic about forecasts and

879
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:19,739
realistic about how you're actually

880
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:22,139
going to make money and it's not by

881
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:25,098
getting a good valuation next round and

882
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:25,099
selling some shares down

883
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:33,618
what about when you investors get

884
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,618
overheated

885
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:41,838
sell it

886
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:45,359
[Laughter]

887
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:47,279
hi I think one of the biggest mistakes

888
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:49,199
we've made as an industry is and I keep

889
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,359
reminding people that this is not just

890
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,519
an agricultural industry you know that

891
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,619
is obviously the the source of where it

892
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:58,199
begins but you have to build a full

893
00:34:55,619 --> 00:35:00,180
supply chain and I think there was a lot

894
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:01,618
of obviously over capitalization in big

895
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:03,239
farms because it was just completely

896
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:05,940
driven by metrics which in the beginning

897
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:07,079
looked fantastic have you seen we

898
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,639
obviously know that's that's changed

899
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:11,338
have you seen a shift

900
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:13,440
in where money is being spent to develop

901
00:35:11,338 --> 00:35:15,000
the supply chain has there been a shift

902
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,679
in the culture of that uh that

903
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,199
deployment of capital

904
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:21,719
so that's funny because it's almost

905
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,819
instinctive and intuitive that the

906
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:26,639
capital comes in and goes in to the

907
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:29,160
front end always first because without

908
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:32,400
that there's really no product however

909
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:34,500
you're right the back end the last yard

910
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,200
of the field let's call it the

911
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,059
distribution cycle Etc you know that's

912
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:41,159
usually where the lease Capital goes

913
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:43,139
into and it's the most important part of

914
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:45,000
the chain and they're real I have not

915
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:46,618
seen that change really here you know

916
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,300
everyone's banking on the fact that it

917
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:50,640
really will be a Pharma distribution

918
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,380
model it'll go into the pharmacies it

919
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:54,659
it's a medical product so that

920
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,820
distribution is in place I'm not

921
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:58,980
necessarily convinced that that's the

922
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,960
scenario but but I agree that's what

923
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,639
what happens is that the capital seems

924
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,199
to come in on the front end and it's

925
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,199
very very light on the back end

926
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,940
I think we've seen some

927
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,740
further investment in technology and

928
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:19,618
whether it's through Delivery Systems or

929
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:23,098
engineered products and things like that

930
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:24,960
because it's a

931
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:26,760
there's a culture thing for you within

932
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,519
the recreational Market than people like

933
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:32,099
people within that market like really do

934
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:33,420
like flour but beyond that in a medical

935
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:35,460
Market

936
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:38,358
doctors and patients are looking for

937
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:41,699
repeatability for

938
00:36:38,358 --> 00:36:43,679
consistency for dose dosage limits

939
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:46,319
things like that and the

940
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:48,539
techno technologies that kind of improve

941
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,338
the API improve the onset improve the

942
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,320
pharmacokinetics we're seeing investment

943
00:36:50,338 --> 00:36:54,420
in that and we're seeing new products

944
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,800
come to the market which you could

945
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,900
describe as

946
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:01,619
third generation fourth generation fifth

947
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:03,059
generation and the these are products

948
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,980
which have the ability to shape the

949
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:07,380
medical Market of the future

950
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:09,900
I full hardly second that not only that

951
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,940
we've seen some innovation of technology

952
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,160
that has been tested in the Cannabis

953
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,139
industry and has been applied outside of

954
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:19,259
the Cannabis industry due to this

955
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:21,480
driving interest is exactly what you

956
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:24,839
said to increase sort of repeatability

957
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,519
to have more transparency scalability so

958
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:27,420
yes I would say I would totally agree

959
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:29,579
with that

960
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,900
like we've we've developed a cannabis

961
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:32,400
tablet that we're running a clinical

962
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,858
trial within Australia at the moment

963
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,858
which is a sublingual comes in a bottle

964
00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:40,679
doctor says two tablets under the tongue

965
00:37:37,858 --> 00:37:42,838
and it's taking taking the guesswork out

966
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:43,940
of oils taking the measuring out taking

967
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:46,980
the

968
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:50,820
uh the unpredictability of your spoon

969
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:53,159
out of it and it's it's improved the

970
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,660
onset improve the pharmacokinetics and

971
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:56,399
we're getting great feedback from

972
00:37:54,659 --> 00:37:59,399
patients and is that is that going to be

973
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:02,059
the future of cannabis

974
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,059
you tell me

975
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:08,240
does it work

976
00:38:04,139 --> 00:38:08,239
yeah hi so um

977
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:16,019
okay so I mean I I'm I heard you that

978
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:17,579
you know that it's been of course and I

979
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:18,739
think we all agree that you know over

980
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:20,940
over

981
00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:22,979
overspending let's say in the Cannabis

982
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,260
in the US has been uh has been certainly

983
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:29,519
an issue also in Canada a lot of value

984
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:32,000
has been burned however the let's say if

985
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:34,639
we analyze maybe the last 20 30 years

986
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,599
every new industry

987
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:42,379
uh software I.T now artificial

988
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:45,780
intelligence electrical battery whatever

989
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,800
so the reality is that the US is

990
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:50,160
generating

991
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,619
the leading companies and in Europe is

992
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:55,858
uh is very good at you know

993
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:58,559
protecting consumers you know and from a

994
00:38:55,858 --> 00:39:01,440
regulatory point of view but in the end

995
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:04,739
the U.S is always kind of dominating the

996
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:08,280
new Industries thanks to these huge flow

997
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:11,639
of capitals and and propension to

998
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:15,000
Innovation and disruptive innovation so

999
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:17,879
do you see any reasons for which the

1000
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,059
Cannabis sector in Europe

1001
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:22,858
should be or at Global level should be a

1002
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:23,820
different industry as compared to all

1003
00:39:22,858 --> 00:39:26,338
the other

1004
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:29,640
new Industries so why why do you expect

1005
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:36,078
the the sector not to be dominated by

1006
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:36,078
U.S companies in the next 10 years

1007
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:40,679
if you've ever smoked Amnesia Haze

1008
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,300
runner in Spain you know why the United

1009
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:46,199
States won't dominate the entire

1010
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:48,359
industry no sorry I think the farmer in

1011
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:50,338
the US is missed the opportunity of

1012
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:52,380
cannabis and farmer in Europe has an

1013
00:39:50,338 --> 00:39:55,019
opportunity to really generate some good

1014
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:57,720
quality Research into

1015
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:59,039
what works and what doesn't whereas in

1016
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:00,838
America they've just completely

1017
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:03,000
forgotten about it they've glossed over

1018
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:04,799
it because

1019
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,420
you can just go to the shop and buy what

1020
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,160
you want or move to another state and

1021
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,380
buy what you want if you wanted and it's

1022
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:12,118
it it's been left in the hands of the

1023
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:14,460
consumer and farmer just doesn't care

1024
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:18,420
over there and Europe has an opportunity

1025
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:20,760
to really Excel there and I don't know

1026
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:24,180
that the us is going to catch up

1027
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:26,880
got him I'm going back to the idea that

1028
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:29,039
we're beginning to see sort of regional

1029
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,079
profiles and expertise in the Cannabis

1030
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:32,940
industry arguably in other Industries as

1031
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:34,740
well but maybe more prominently in the

1032
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,838
Cannabis industry because it's like this

1033
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:38,819
controlled environment that we can all

1034
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:40,338
sort of really like look at as it's

1035
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:43,019
happening very quickly

1036
00:40:40,338 --> 00:40:45,239
I would say Europe has many advantages I

1037
00:40:43,019 --> 00:40:46,739
mean Beyond you know the research in

1038
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:48,358
farming research being the operative

1039
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:49,858
word there when you look at Health and

1040
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:51,480
Beauty and food and beverage look at

1041
00:40:49,858 --> 00:40:53,880
where European stands in terms of

1042
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,740
consumer packaged Goods I mean some of

1043
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,720
the largest conglomerates come out of

1044
00:40:55,739 --> 00:41:00,118
here you look at L'Oreal and all these

1045
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:03,000
these guys that have really led the way

1046
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:04,980
and the US is barely touching so I think

1047
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,320
it's about going back and thinking about

1048
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,940
what is the talent and expertise that

1049
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,500
already exists and how does that get

1050
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,940
applied to the Cannabis industry and

1051
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,820
then how does the regional industry

1052
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:16,619
positions in this case Europe to compete

1053
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:19,019
at a global level with other regions

1054
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:21,420
when it comes down to that so Europe has

1055
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:23,579
as much of an opportunity as Latin

1056
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,139
America or Africa well maybe those are

1057
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:26,640
not great example but they could also

1058
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:29,159
have an opportunity when it comes to

1059
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:31,980
low-cost farming where they could really

1060
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:34,259
produce the lowest cost high quality

1061
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:36,240
cultivation of hemp for instance and

1062
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,460
give an example it really is going back

1063
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:41,338
to what is your talent what is your

1064
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:44,179
expertise how do you capitalize on it by

1065
00:41:41,338 --> 00:41:44,179
sticking to it

1066
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:50,400
one more question last question

1067
00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:53,219
okay hi guys um I'm Nikki from sea salt

1068
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,380
in China so I have a questions what has

1069
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:57,899
the cannabis companies done in the last

1070
00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:00,980
three years that made most of the

1071
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:04,260
company lose money sustainably

1072
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:08,460
especially the public companies in North

1073
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:11,579
America like canopy Theory they this the

1074
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:14,519
share has dropped like a [ __ ] so is

1075
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:16,920
there anything that is there any lessons

1076
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:19,619
that European market actually can learn

1077
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:22,079
from it absolutely that's I mean that's

1078
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:25,619
exactly why we pushed all our chips here

1079
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:28,260
in in Europe and the MCO model

1080
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:29,940
what happened in the U.S and I'll just

1081
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,800
I'll speak to that because I've invested

1082
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:34,559
more in the U.S than in Canadian

1083
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,900
companies but having a government put

1084
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:39,719
pressure having the wrong scheduling on

1085
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:42,838
this drug by over taxing at a state

1086
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:45,118
level not allowing access to proper

1087
00:42:42,838 --> 00:42:48,179
banking I mean there's no there's no

1088
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,039
reason why Goldman Sachs isn't able to

1089
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:51,960
go make investments in the Cannabis

1090
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:55,079
space but it's because of our backwards

1091
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:58,318
laws that we have here if Europe

1092
00:42:55,079 --> 00:43:00,780
and really ultimately the globe this

1093
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:02,579
takes the right steps now and takes the

1094
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,859
right actions and when when I hear

1095
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:07,079
things that slow down here I know it

1096
00:43:04,858 --> 00:43:09,119
frustrates everybody oh you know this

1097
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:12,539
this set us back no it really makes us

1098
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:15,180
from keeps us from making mistakes right

1099
00:43:12,539 --> 00:43:17,579
now the mistakes that we've learned in

1100
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:20,399
the U.S the implosion of let's call it

1101
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:22,440
the stocks in Canada you gotta have a

1102
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,619
company that has earnings you know you

1103
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:29,700
in any boom of of a of a Marketplace

1104
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:31,980
tech stocks telecom stocks biomed stocks

1105
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:34,199
whatever those can only ride on a boom

1106
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:36,358
for so long eventually you have to have

1107
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:38,639
the earnings behind that that's why I

1108
00:43:36,358 --> 00:43:41,159
believe the opportunity is here I

1109
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,900
believe the opportunity is here now and

1110
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:45,000
I believe that the opportunity for

1111
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,920
Investments and I I mean we partnered

1112
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,380
with a Pharma company you know I think

1113
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,358
to to jump on that as well of what can

1114
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,099
happen now when you have where Pharma

1115
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:53,940
companies can really be in business with

1116
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:55,920
you

1117
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:58,200
versus let's call it what happens in the

1118
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:01,139
U.S we're only a handful of monopolies

1119
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:02,879
get that opportunity I think the sky's

1120
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:04,559
dilemma is here so again when I'm

1121
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,140
optimistic I'm not just a little

1122
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:09,000
optimistic I'm all in optimistic so I

1123
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:10,618
think you have a great question we've

1124
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,440
learned everything that can go wrong

1125
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:15,240
there you name it it's gone wrong now we

1126
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,500
have an opportunity really to to

1127
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:18,539
monopolize

1128
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:21,059
through those thoughts and now

1129
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:22,750
capitalize properly

1130
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:26,000
fantastic thank you so much

1131
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:26,000
[Applause]
