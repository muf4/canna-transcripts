1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:03,960
the

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,959
science of cannabis

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:09,559
extraction right it's a science you

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,719
don't just wash your hash or get some

5
00:00:09,558 --> 00:00:13,879
tubes in a can of butane and try not to

6
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:16,480
blow yourself up in the backyard there's

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,839
a better way to do it it's way more

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:23,079
Technical and to lead us in this German

9
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:25,399
YouTube cannabis activist and Pioneer

10
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:28,198
and legendary I don't even know how you

11
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:30,038
say legendary cannabis user in German

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,548
but I'm sure there's a word for it let's

13
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:38,950

so welcome everybody to our panel of uh

19
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,400
the signs uh about the SS of cannabis

20
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,680
extraction and uh I'm very glad I'm very

21
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,880
proud uh to present you five experts in

22
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,840
Canabis uh extraction uh from yeah

23
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:38,158
different companies from different

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,759
continents and uh let me start to

25
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,840
introduce I will introduce anybody uh by

26
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,359
uh when when he answers his first

27
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,840
question so you don't have to wait so

28
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,959
long for our expertise so my first

29
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:55,079
question my introduction is uh to Mr uh

30
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:57,919
to Mr Nick and branos is that right yeah

31
00:01:55,078 --> 00:02:01,038
I I I'm not so good

32
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,759
pronouncing uh so

33
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:06,320
um you're in the canab business or in

34
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,318
the extraction business quite long in

35
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:13,919
2009 you founded canab bre which is a

36
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:16,919
quite uh success successful B2B distrib

37
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,839
distributor and as we all know we're

38
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:20,359
talking about on the ICBC we're always

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,159
talking about two different markets

40
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,080
we're talking about the European market

41
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:27,280
and we're talking about the US and the

42
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,440
Canadian Market the overseas Market how

43
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,318
we call it um when when it comes to

44
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:34,919
cannabis extraction what would you say

45
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:37,518
what are the basic difference because

46
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:40,238
you are experienced on both sides of the

47
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,319
of the Atlantic so what would you say

48
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,200
which is uh what are the basic

49
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:45,439
difference between our two markets or

50
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:48,759
the two

51
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:52,280
markets uh regulation is more strict in

52
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:54,239
Europe uh taking care of safety factors

53
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,598
of the extraction methods are much

54
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,519
stricter also documentation and the key

55
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:02,359
word here is also eug GMP it is there

56
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:04,280
are factors that they were not they're

57
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,560
not so strong in the US although in the

58
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,318
US and Canada although of course they

59
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,519
are they take good care of safety but at

60
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,598
a different level that we would like to

61
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:18,680
do it here in the

62
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:21,359
EU yeah thank you very much and uh this

63
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,799
is uh my next question goes to the next

64
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,920
expert who is also experienced on both

65
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,000
continents

66
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:33,399
rarez uh you're you're working for your

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,318
CEO of a parap uh which is uh located in

68
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,400
Portugal and um what would you say what

69
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:41,399
are your experiences year mostly because

70
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,200
Portugal is part of the EU and Portugal

71
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,640
only medical cannabis is legal

72
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:48,039
recreational is still illegal so what

73
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:49,878
are your experience with especially

74
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:53,199
European

75
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:55,878
regulation well the European regulation

76
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,719
actually I think comes for good because

77
00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:01,878
talking about the United States and if

78
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:06,039
we look say for reports from Bright Labs

79
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:09,560
I think from 2021 30% of extracts had

80
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:10,840
high contaminations of pesticides and so

81
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,719
these are the ones that are actually

82
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,079
measured so people that send samples to

83
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:22,600
be analyz it that is I think a small uh

84
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:25,680
minery so if we want to to have a safe

85
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,000
Canabis uh usage doesn't matter if it's

86
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,959
medical or if it's recreational in in

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,079
Europe so that people can consume

88
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,120
knowing that they are taking a safe

89
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:38,399
product regulation is absolutely

90
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,240
necessary that's the way to go I'm all

91
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,359
in in terms of uh the regulation it's

92
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:47,360
only way to

93
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,360
go so when it comes to regulation we

94
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,759
also have to talk about extraction

95
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:56,319
technique because the better the

96
00:04:52,759 --> 00:05:00,199
technique the P the product is Jorge um

97
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:05,478
George stf or the doct George stter

98
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:08,759
sorry stf is that right correct uh uh

99
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:12,038
he's uh we met this morning and he's in

100
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,639
the German in the in the in the uh us

101
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:17,318
and also in the European extraction

102
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:20,800
industry and he introduced me uh a

103
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:23,479
technique I've never heard of and I'm

104
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,160
really very I'm not too deep but at

105
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:28,079
least I wrote a book about cannabis

106
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,199
extraction which is available here also

107
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:34,719
and in German language

108
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:36,840
and I was really surprised about the way

109
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,720
you do your construction so what's

110
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:43,599
what's different the way do you uh you

111
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,039
do your extraction from the standard

112
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,560
extraction when we talk extraction we

113
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:52,680
always have to honor Europe as um where

114
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,160
the extraction is originated so Claudius

115
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,800
galenus in the 100 years ad started

116
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,919
extracting with ethanol and and water

117
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,600
and he documented that for over 50

118
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:06,038
different herbs and it's uh really uh to

119
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:09,960
our days um Europe has been operating

120
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:11,639
based on strict regulations and um

121
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,000
everything that we do into the

122
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,000
extraction space uh we try to make and

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,399
improve this extraction they've been

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,918
after the like simple methods of

125
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,439
extraction um liquefied gas extraction

126
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:25,399
was added which is very quick and uh

127
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,439
clean extraction which improves the

128
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:31,120
purity of the extract regulated by

129
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:33,079
Pharma so what developed is a next

130
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,280
generation of liquefied gas extraction

131
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:39,359
that uh Works uh combines the advantages

132
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:44,359
of all current extractions the ethanol

133
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:47,080
the butane hydrocarbons the CO2 um and

134
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,000
it's something that delivers a full

135
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:51,519
power of the plant into ambient

136
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,240
conditions preserving the ph and the

137
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,519
medicinal Valu so that's um um in P five

138
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,800
extraction we've been working that in

139
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:00,359
the last 10 years uh in the Cannabis

140
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,720
industry and last 20 years into the

141
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,800
fragance and flavor industry improving

142
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,360
that extraction methods thank you very

143
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,720
much George Jonah Jonah Baba we know

144
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,960
quite a long time already he comes from

145
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,680
the consu consumer side of cannabis may

146
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:18,439
I say so you used to be consumer before

147
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,000
you found before you went into the

148
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:24,399
business or they say do what you love

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,918
and stuff and so I I I did find a lot of

150
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,000
uh early benefits from that side that's

151
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:30,198
what also drove me to get into the

152
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,598
industry was my passion um just

153
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,759
believing in the therapeutic and uh

154
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:38,598
benefits of the

155
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:41,560
plant and so you built up M MX laps in

156
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:43,639
2013 already which means uh you're in

157
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,478
the lab business and the for in the

158
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,038
extraction business you know ex

159
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:48,878
extraction you know the products for a

160
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,759
long time

161
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,280
um what would you say the difference

162
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,598
between European extraction which you're

163
00:07:54,279 --> 00:08:00,119
not or what is most advanced what what

164
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,399
what does the consumer search in

165
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,158
in the oversea Market at the moment and

166
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,679
what does the consumer search here on

167
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:09,360
the European market what what do you

168
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,478
say yeah I I think I think the way I

169
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,400
would look at it is I see I see Europe

170
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,519
where probably like the US was maybe

171
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:19,719
like 10 years ago is probably pretty

172
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:21,478
good comparison to where we you when we

173
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,199
started on the analytical lab side which

174
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:24,439
is really interesting because being at

175
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,400
an analytical lab you're at the

176
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:27,959
Forefront of products you see everything

177
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,878
that's coming into the lab what's moving

178
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:33,559
what's popular and I remember back in

179
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,038
2012 when we started the lab all we saw

180
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,759
was flour and then overnight we just

181
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:38,240
started seeing extracts just flood into

182
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:40,439
the lab and actually it was very poor

183
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,038
extracts to be honest with you it was I

184
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,480
so badly wanted to like them but I hated

185
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:46,360
it tasted like burnt popcorn and just

186
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,159
they're adding propylene gly call just

187
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,519
there was Heavy solvent still left in it

188
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,759
it was actually very scary because there

189
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:55,519
was no solvent uh testing required at

190
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:57,200
the time and so you were seeing um so

191
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,240
people were doing QC testing but they're

192
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,278
still putting those products out in the

193
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,079
market for medicinal reasons and it was

194
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:03,559
just very scary so actually what led us

195
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:04,879
into getting into the extraction side

196
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:06,838
was based off test results and that's

197
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,159
where we started IMX which is now

198
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,519
decimal which does extraction equipment

199
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:13,639
But to answer your question so from that

200
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,679
side it was very heavily flower in the

201
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:19,120
beginning and then it very quickly kind

202
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:21,159
of evolved into um extraction which was

203
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,919
a combination of Vape pins Edibles

204
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:27,039
topicals creams and so I think we'll

205
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:28,958
we'll see that here shortly I think in

206
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,039
Europe I think what people will see is

207
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,078
it'll start slow but then it ramps up

208
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,559
really really quick from that side and

209
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:36,599
so like just some of the advice I would

210
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,039
give people that are starting out is to

211
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,600
plan for Rapid expansion quickly so

212
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,519
you're not um trying to play catchup or

213
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,040
change a lot of your infrastructure or

214
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,159
things like that as well plan for that

215
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,078
now and also I'd say be versatile from

216
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:50,519
that side it's going to be very

217
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:51,359
important to be versatile to the market

218
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,839
especially when it gets to a

219
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,600
recreational side When It ultimately

220
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:56,240
gets there because the market can be

221
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,879
very finicky and also change very

222
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,039
quickly like what might be popular one

223
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:01,320
year might be something completely

224
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:03,759
different than next year and if you're

225
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,040
in a position to essentially be to adapt

226
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,278
quickly you'll be able to grab bigger

227
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:10,360
market share um a lot faster as well and

228
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:13,679
so I think you'll just really see the

229
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,240
products as it evolves uh really expand

230
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,239
quite quite

231
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:23,480
quickly thank you Jonah uh Steve you're

232
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:26,078
also l experienc in the US cannabis

233
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:29,759
industry for 12 years uh now you're

234
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:33,439
working for scii or you founded ccii uh

235
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:38,360
you're from more from the East Coast yes

236
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,959
correct um as a German um cannabis

237
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:45,839
activist I always looked on the west

238
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:49,000
coast um but on the is there

239
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,560
anything different on the east coast is

240
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,039
do you use different techniques over

241
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:57,278
there or is there a different cannabis

242
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:59,360
extraction culture because uh yeah I i'

243
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:03,200
I've all because cannabis New York is

244
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,240
legal now in I've heard and so um yeah

245
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,320
is there any difference in or local

246
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:11,600
difference in extraction techniques it's

247
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,920
funny to say that I see I'm a CEO of

248
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,800
monzana extracts in New York state and

249
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:19,240
we're starting an operation there and I

250
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:22,159
see New York in a very similar phase or

251
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,759
stage to where Europe is right now uh

252
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,480
and and it seems like most countries go

253
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,759
through these stages of early adoption

254
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,200
and then you know ramping up efficiency

255
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,319
and and to Jonah's point I think the

256
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,079
biggest thing uh one of the biggest

257
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,200
things I see here that's very different

258
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,278
both in New York and here versus the

259
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,680
west coast is

260
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:44,480
scale we see uh people trying to process

261
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:46,719
one or two pounds at a time in the small

262
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,800
scales which is easy to do with raw and

263
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,800
presses and that type of thing but

264
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:54,479
eventually when prices drop and they

265
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:57,639
will uh you're going to need to scale up

266
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,200
so efficiencies of scale take place and

267
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:03,240
that's where the larger ethanol larger

268
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:06,320
larger CO2 larger um uh hydrocarbon

269
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,879
machines become more potent uh the other

270
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,839
thing that we're very focused on are

271
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:14,000
tpes not just the uh extraction of them

272
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:16,639
but the separation of them and so I

273
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
think as this Market evolves there'll be

274
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,600
a big need uh for extra turpine

275
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,679
production and a lot of that will come

276
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,079
from

277
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:29,559
hemp um the rumor just next question the

278
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:32,359
rumor in Germany is uh t torped

279
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:35,638
extracted from hemp are too expensive

280
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,800
what do you agree well I would say that

281
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,039
tpin are too expensive to begin with

282
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:42,439
because they're ephemeral uh they're

283
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:45,759
difficult to capture uh in in their

284
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:48,519
entirety they're difficult to store in

285
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:51,039
their entirety and keep them unaltered

286
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:52,560
and most extraction methods and I I hope

287
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,319
I won't offend anybody on the panel by

288
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:58,039
saying this but um very often uh

289
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,120
techniques like ethanol extraction uh

290
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:03,439
can destroy those valuable turpins um

291
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,159
CO2 has the capacity to capture them at

292
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,800
a subcritical level uh but but most of

293
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:11,078
us in the industry who extract would

294
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:13,479
agree that propanes and butanes uh tend

295
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:16,078
to be the best at capturing the full

296
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,720
spectrum of tpes uh and the last thing

297
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:19,958
I'll add to that is that there are new

298
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,959
technologies coming in play right now uh

299
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:24,039
through membranes that allow you to

300
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:26,198
separate those tpin from the

301
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:28,000
cannabinoids and ultimately where this

302
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:29,639
market ends up if you're really speaking

303
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,440
about medical

304
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:36,360
cannabis is to get pure constituents

305
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,560
pure THC pure CBD and generally that

306
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,759
involves some form of crystallization so

307
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,799
when we take those tpin out we can then

308
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:44,838
move towards that crystallization and

309
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:47,958
then reconstitute or as pharmacists call

310
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:49,360
it Rec compound to precise Doses and

311
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:53,758
then we can really start to talk about

312
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:56,959
medical products okay let

313
00:13:53,759 --> 00:14:00,519
me speak out the

314
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:03,879
theory um the lower the in point of the

315
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:06,399
solvent is the better the product is

316
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:09,159
anybody who once can answer Jorge you

317
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:12,039
looked at me first absolutely I agree

318
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:14,078
with that because uh Boiling Point now

319
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:16,360
the most popular methods are separating

320
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:18,000
components by boiling points and when

321
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,278
you have let's say I don't know what 80

322
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,679
and your first trip in evaporating at

323
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:24,120
100 then you don't really have a margin

324
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:26,679
to separate you're going to end up with

325
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,679
a lot of residual solvent that's why uh

326
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:33,559
going super subcritical and uh Co 2 or

327
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:36,838
uh using iosol R134 or using butane

328
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:39,198
where the boiling point is um close to

329
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,279
zero uh and you have a full 100 degree

330
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:44,559
of separation you can really preserve

331
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:47,639
those turpins uh it's very important

332
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:49,159
also not to destruct and Destroy these

333
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:53,278
turpins because some of the metals

334
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:56,799
during heat and uh oxygen it's um

335
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:58,000
oxidize the turbs and you lose um monot

336
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:00,198
turs very often because they're the

337
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,320
smallest molecule

338
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:07,838
and the sience of CHS actually um

339
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,160
if it is uh known by the science that

340
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:14,199
currently uh the CHS they enhan the

341
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:16,120
cannaboids uh 50% uh like if they go

342
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:18,919
into the body they activate the receptor

343
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,360
50% before the cannaboid uh connects to

344
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:25,120
the receptor um this is recent study

345
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,839
from uh Russo a few months ago and uh

346
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,679
that proves that preserving the full

347
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,160
tpin profile of a plant as it appears in

348
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,439
the strain is going to increase

349
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:37,000
bioavailability of the same plant not

350
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,440
looking for like water soluble or

351
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,879
anything else the plant by itself

352
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,639
provides you the option for uh better

353
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:45,278
medical treatment so preserving the T

354
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:47,480
terpens in a full profile is very

355
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,600
important for um for the medicinal

356
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,079
values of the plant

357
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,720
itself just just to add to that now I'll

358
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,239
start by saying there there's no one

359
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,480
perfect extraction method or one

360
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,318
extraction method that's better than

361
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,000
another it all depends on what someone

362
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:01,679
wants to make but when we're talking

363
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,039
about turpine preservation and things

364
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,439
like that I think what's really uh

365
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:06,958
unique and exciting to be able to

366
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,959
introduce to Europe that's been doing in

367
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,039
the US is from a hydrocarbon extraction

368
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,719
standpoint is being able to run fresh

369
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:16,559
Frozen um and run it and that to get

370
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,920
like the highest tpine content in in

371
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,399
doing that and so um that's some groups

372
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:21,958
here we're talking about too also which

373
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,799
also changes the cultivation side

374
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:26,198
because no one's been looking at doing

375
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:29,000
that over here as well too to how to

376
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:30,078
properly you know store fresh Frozen get

377
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,519
ready for the extractors because it

378
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,039
really hasn't been an opportunity yet

379
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:37,120
but in my opinion that's one of the best

380
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:41,759
ways to get the highest turpine

381
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:46,560
profile I fully agree but um there are a

382
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,720
new K in Block that is still CO2 but CO2

383
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:52,159
under pressure and in cogenic

384
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,759
temperatures between 0 and minus 20 here

385
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:58,480
you can also work with fresh frozen

386
00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:00,919
flowers uh you can even tune if you use

387
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,600
small amounts ofal solvent like ethanol

388
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:06,639
and other class two solvents that are

389
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,078
allowed for medical and pharmaceutical

390
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,839
applications here you can tune even for

391
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:16,359
the type of tpin so mon D or

392
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:17,519
threein and save them with efficiencies

393
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:21,159
of over

394
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:24,480
90% with the advantage to other Bane or

395
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,439
so on because when you are using bhan

396
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,200
you always keep

397
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:32,919
the you always keep these gases sve it

398
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,720
then you have to go to vacuum

399
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:37,400
applications of vacuum treatment in

400
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,839
vacuum noens to the gas to take the

401
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,559
othery carbon out

402
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,038
but tpin are also volatile so you are

403
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:48,200
also losing in these process trins if

404
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:52,720
you are extracting using this CO2 cryo

405
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:54,480
CO2 method of once you bring to am in

406
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,159
temp temperature is

407
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,919
gone um so at the end the efficiency is

408
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:03,520
in terms of capturing the pins is higher

409
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:06,240
and you also can tune this at the same

410
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:10,279
time this same technique can extract

411
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:14,558
with efficiencies over 90% cannabinoids

412
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:16,519
And once again by tuning the the poity

413
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:20,079
of our solvent that is mixed between the

414
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:21,038
liquid CO2 and the ethanol or other

415
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:24,279
class two

416
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:27,319
solvents you are very selective to what

417
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:29,720
you are aiming to extract it can be THC

418
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:32,038
it can be CBD or it can be a

419
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,600
floid uh and the best proof and

420
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:35,839
fantastic thing about this new

421
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,199
technology is that it doesn't matter if

422
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:41,240
you are extracting from really bad

423
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:45,240
starting material like shredded biomass

424
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:49,319
from flowers and leaves together with 2

425
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:52,480
3% or if you have hemp with 5 6% or if

426
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:55,200
you have a 10% flour or a 15 potency

427
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,558
flour 20 or 25 your extracts will be

428
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,440
always over

429
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:01,639
80% why because you are simply

430
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,720
extracting what you want cannabinoids

431
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,679
leaving most of the other andw

432
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,759
components behind this is really

433
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:12,600
revolutionary I'm working on instraction

434
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:14,038
for 35 years uh in CO2 typically

435
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:16,399
supercal

436
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:17,480
applications this technique can run in a

437
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,798
super

438
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:23,440
critical typical system but modified to

439
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:27,038
have in these conditions and this is

440
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,159
unique uh usually in super critical

441
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:31,599
extraction you don't get quality and

442
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:33,679
speed if you want high quality so a very

443
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,038
pure extract you have to go slow low

444
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,000
pressures low

445
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:40,038
temperatures otherwise you not get

446
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,919
quality High perod with this technique

447
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:44,759
for the same extractor vessel you are

448
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:47,679
increasing three to five times the

449
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:49,798
throughput but keeping an extremely is

450
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,240
not high extremely high quality extract

451
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:56,158
this is really groundbreaking I think

452
00:19:53,240 --> 00:20:01,038
for me that works on co2 extractions for

453
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:03,600
over 35 years is the very big step

454
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:08,119
forward I've seen in over these 45 years

455
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:11,158
because CO2 on P past in these years

456
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:15,519
didn't change much so this was a big

457
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:21,159
Improvement uh that I highly recommend

458
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:23,480
it so when it comes to CO2 extraction uh

459
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:27,760
you need a lot of equipment let me say

460
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:29,200
it uh easily and already the easy way so

461
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,759
in Germany

462
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,120
we'll have cannabis clubs very

463
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:36,200
soon they're allowed to do

464
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:39,719
extractions but they are not allowed to

465
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:42,279
solvent extractions even water hash

466
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,558
though water is not a solvent is

467
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:46,599
considered a solvent

468
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:49,279
extractions what would you recommend

469
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:51,279
them Nick the German cannabis clubs

470
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,918
probably some are sitting here and

471
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:55,879
listening yeah with regards to water

472
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,880
extraction if it's what would you

473
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:01,320
recommend if you have a Canabis Club you

474
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:03,600
produce Canabis for 500 people yeah uh

475
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:05,200
and uh you want to make extraction but

476
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,158
you're not allowed to do solvent

477
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,798
extraction and you're not allowed to do

478
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:11,640
water hash what would you recommend a

479
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:14,599
driving Club you cannot do solvent and

480
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,200
you cannot do water extraction exactly

481
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:20,759
so I guess you can press it we can press

482
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:24,080
it uh here we can make make anything

483
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:26,000
which is mechanical yeah in a water in a

484
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:27,918
way in a way water extraction is

485
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,519
mechanical extraction in a way exactly

486
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:33,159
but because we don't have experts who

487
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:36,639
are in response of the law they consider

488
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:39,600
water extraction as a solvent extraction

489
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,799
we try some uh some people from the

490
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:45,000
Cannabis industry try to explain try to

491
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:47,519
Lobby that water has is not a solvent ex

492
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,278
it's not it's nons solvent but you know

493
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,679
they don't understand it's considered

494
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:54,720
mechanical separation in a way it's like

495
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:57,080
yeah but they don't understand for the

496
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,038
not it's also because it's dangerous you

497
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:01,000
know it's it's not a low oniv level

498
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,319
because it's dangerous for example in

499
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,798
Colorado and they just didn't understand

500
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:07,558
that you know that's because we only a

501
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:09,720
lot of lawyers made it but there were

502
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:13,558
not too many cannabis experts uh when it

503
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:16,159
came to the law so that's the problem so

504
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:18,200
I guess there are not many options left

505
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:22,520
CO2 I guess it's out of the picture as

506
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:26,200
well yes so what are we left with it's a

507
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:29,000
GI paper static yeah imagine that could

508
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,960
be so you have to extract for 500 people

509
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,798
every month

510
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:37,038
and could be a solution I guess it's

511
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:39,599
it's a way of extracting with no

512
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:42,879
solvents with using heat and evaporating

513
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:44,839
the oils out of the plants and then uh

514
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,640
collecting them again I guess that could

515
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:49,038
be but then again you need very big

516
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,278
systems for the small size of the Social

517
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:54,558
Clubs it becomes very narrow the options

518
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:58,558
if you are talking about small amounts

519
00:22:54,558 --> 00:23:01,079
with small systems I guess making ke and

520
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:04,678
pressing it should be a way that is

521
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:07,319
mechanical purely and uh it can it can

522
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:10,120
work for sure but on a

523
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:12,839
level anybody else can answer please on

524
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:16,678
a level where you make it for 500

525
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:18,959
people uh would you agree to say that's

526
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:20,759
not economical at all if you cannot do

527
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:25,000
solvent

528
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:27,720
construction I agree to that because um

529
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,359
when you use sifting you only rely on

530
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,159
the Tricom and there is much more

531
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:34,678
potency inside of the plant you use

532
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:37,120
probably 30% of the uh entire cannaboids

533
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:38,720
into the plant and any mechanical

534
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,918
extraction is not selective so your

535
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,640
quality of the extract it kind of May

536
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:46,120
Vary a lot and I completely understand

537
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,799
their decision of trying to put the

538
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:51,278
water into the solvent because once they

539
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:53,558
say water is legal then uh or uh good

540
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:56,278
for like solventless immediately two

541
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:58,440
other metals going to get in that the

542
00:23:56,278 --> 00:24:00,000
steam extraction steam distillation and

543
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,360
and superheated water extraction

544
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,720
superheated water extraction is a

545
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:06,399
special type of extraction which also we

546
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,440
produce uh that can make water to behave

547
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,640
as ethanol and you really can get a very

548
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,200
good extract out of that too so uh maybe

549
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,278
they have this concern when they uh try

550
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,558
to classify um harush Bubble extraction

551
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:22,319
but still sifting and pressing or

552
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:23,278
pressing even without sifting but then

553
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:25,158
you're going to end up with some

554
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:26,919
chlorophylls and some uh other things

555
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:30,039
that you don't really know that don't

556
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:32,759
really want into will influence the

557
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:35,440
taste very interesting because water

558
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:38,240
water steam extraction I wrote my book

559
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,798
four years ago and I announced in the

560
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,200
last chapter that steam extraction is

561
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:47,079
the future but there was no steam

562
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,759
extraction at that time um Bo what do

563
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:50,759
you say about steam extraction because

564
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:53,359
this is very very interesting in in my

565
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:55,839
eyes because uh it's under hot steam

566
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:58,158
under pressure and there are no solvents

567
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:00,038
at all it's just water so did you hear

568
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,240
about it what do you say about

569
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:07,919
extraction I know applications only for

570
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:13,000
the pins and if we don't care for out

571
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:16,240
flower stays after and if thein is the

572
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:20,000
only uh uh main compound we want to

573
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:23,200
extract steam distillation is absolutely

574
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,640
the best technique uh the efficiencies

575
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,919
Forin is high I was surprised when I

576
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,840
heard saying that it's expensive to

577
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,840
extract

578
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:34,759
tpin from hemp because steam

579
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:37,278
distillation is a quite low cost distill

580
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:38,960
extraction technique and it's extremely

581
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:41,759
efficient we tried this with hemp and

582
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,360
the results were fantastic and I was

583
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:47,278
comparing with some of with all

584
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:49,839
techniques discussed today here without

585
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:52,599
any exception and steam

586
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:54,879
distillation for Pins got the best

587
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:58,839
results period by far the deficiencies

588
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:01,159
were huge but there is one new K on

589
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:03,319
block also there not commercially

590
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:06,600
available still in velopment but coming

591
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:09,158
soon that may resolve the German problem

592
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:13,000
microwave extraction so he already us it

593
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:16,000
now for the pins but is and is

594
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,919
commercially available uh patented by an

595
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,839
intalian company but with very good

596
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,679
results expensive equipment but is

597
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:25,199
coming now a solution for cannabiz

598
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:27,440
extraction also based on microwave can

599
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,600
you maybe explain to me and to the

600
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:34,159
audience in a few words how microwave

601
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:37,319
extraction works well microwaves is

602
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:41,159
microwav is just a wave type of wave in

603
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:43,798
a certain in a certain uh Spectrum zone

604
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:47,278
of the right radio frequency

605
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:49,720
spectrum uh that as you all know we have

606
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:54,200
microwaves ovens at home that has

607
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:57,759
capacity to warm to warm any material we

608
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:00,960
put inside the oven uh the point is that

609
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:03,798
if you tune for certain frequencies

610
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,200
microwave you are making vibrating for

611
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:09,639
instance only the tpin this is how the

612
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:13,759
tpin are extracted and being volatile so

613
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:16,440
by eating just the tpin in the flour

614
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:18,720
they vaporize and then they are easily

615
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,558
extracted this is how it's working now

616
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,759
with

617
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:25,240
cannabinoids having being not so

618
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:28,919
volatile having higher Bing points uh

619
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:32,599
that task is not so simple but have been

620
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:35,399
uh advaned on past years and very soon

621
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:38,798
there will be here equipments that will

622
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:41,518
be able to extract cannabinoid using

623
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:43,359
microwaves uh they are not in market now

624
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,278
because there has been an effort to make

625
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:47,439
these

626
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:49,798
equipment GMP compliant for

627
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,360
pharmaceutical applications sincerely I

628
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:55,679
think it will be difficult to get at

629
00:27:51,359 --> 00:28:00,439
that level but for recreational adult

630
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:03,960
use technology at it present State it's

631
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,440
there so can be a next big thing very

632
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,480
interesting uh because what I started

633
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:12,240
growing wheat in 1996 you know you were

634
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:15,200
always tempted maybe to put the wheat in

635
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,599
the microwave after you hared it but

636
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,519
there was a rule never do that you know

637
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:21,678
a good grower does not put his wheat in

638
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:26,200
the

639
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:28,559
microwave uh but I always learn J those

640
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:32,120
did you hear about microwave extraction

641
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:34,639
is that a topic in the US it it's not no

642
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:36,959
I I know using microwaves for other um

643
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,919
things um when it comes to processing

644
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,480
and things like that and drying but no

645
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:43,038
not for

646
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,200
extraction it's an American Technology

647
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:47,319
it's an American company it's there are

648
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,759
some technologies up there microwave but

649
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:52,678
they also destruct very very badly some

650
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:54,720
longchain molecules so it's needs to be

651
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:55,919
perfected for canabo I completely agree

652
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,720
with

653
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,640
you it's it's well I I want to address

654
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,798
want to point up front which is that

655
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,080
water is the quintessential universal

656
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:08,119
solvent so it is absolutely a solvent in

657
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:12,439
that way um to address the issue earlier

658
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:15,158
I I think that uh um a a club could take

659
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,320
dry ice if it was practical and Tumble

660
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:19,840
it and get much more efficacy and

661
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:22,240
potency in tumbling and then press that

662
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,599
ke yeah uh but to the point of microwave

663
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,798
I believe uh it's my understanding that

664
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:28,719
uh in Canada it's being used with some

665
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:32,558
success in a CGM

666
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:35,919
environment but for drying I'm sorry for

667
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:37,319
drying not for extraction yet so there

668
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,320
are a couple companies now that are

669
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:43,200
offering uh an extraction phase for that

670
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:45,879
okay and a T and A canabo extraction I

671
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,159
knew about the American I'm sorry I knew

672
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,840
about the Americans not the Canadians

673
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,320
the Canadians good news there's also

674
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:53,599
another thing called Hollow core

675
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:55,639
technology extraction but you know

676
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,038
ultimately with all extraction methods

677
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,278
as Jon has pointed out there's a ying

678
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:01,558
and a Yang to all of them and the needle

679
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:04,759
you have to thread is the fine line

680
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:06,038
between capex and Opex and the one point

681
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:08,398
that no one's brought up yet that's

682
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:10,558
going to be critical not now but when

683
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,798
the market matures is the cost per

684
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:15,480
kilogram and that's where certain

685
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:17,398
methods will start to win over uh over

686
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,360
others you know I would never debate

687
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:23,278
that CO2 uh doesn't have some fantastic

688
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:25,479
qualities to it but when those cost

689
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:29,880
factors start to weigh in sometimes

690
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:34,000
other methods will uh will prove less L

691
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:37,240
costly um we did not talk about the most

692
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,359
popular or the most spread uh uh

693
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:43,640
extraction technique which is

694
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:44,959
alcohol uh German pH pharmacies mostly

695
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,720
extract with

696
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,440
alcohol

697
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:53,120
um do the US I mean the advanced

698
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,840
technology companies in us do they still

699
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:59,518
use alcohol or is that so to

700
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:01,918
speak something you did years ago we we

701
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:05,558
do um the problem is alcohol is almost

702
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:07,919
too effective it it grabs so much and

703
00:31:05,558 --> 00:31:10,359
and uh so your Downstream post

704
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,240
purification needs to be even more

705
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:15,199
robust and so I'd agree with with Steve

706
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:18,200
on that where we see a lot of ethanol

707
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,919
use is primarily is primarily built for

708
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,159
like people that want to go to bulk dist

709
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:25,080
or isolations and is what is usually

710
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:27,360
when we sell ethanol systems from a

711
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:31,079
volume standpoint if you're if you're

712
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:32,599
more focused on very high tpine profile

713
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:35,199
type if you're typically going to use a

714
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:39,519
different such as hydrocarbon or

715
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:43,880
CO2 thank you and does anybody or anyone

716
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:46,278
of the gentlemen see future in THC uh

717
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:49,278
steam distillation Under

718
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:51,398
Pressure do you think that this will be

719
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:53,880
like the future of extraction or this

720
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:55,518
will never work steam distillation

721
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,120
probably not going to work for that it's

722
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:01,120
too of a large molecule for evaporation

723
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:03,038
it needs different parameters like uh to

724
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,918
push into different temperatures in

725
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:07,798
order to get it out that's why we

726
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:09,360
develop a special meod which is super uh

727
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:12,879
some people call it super critical but

728
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:15,678
it's really um super heated water so

729
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,200
it's also under pressure with airless

730
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,840
environment and when the water is put in

731
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,679
that environment it behaves like you can

732
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:25,678
tune it really like 80% alcohol or 90%

733
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:28,159
alcohol or 20% alcohol so it really

734
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,240
works into the full range of uh Co you

735
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,559
as

736
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:34,079
well okay thank you George the one

737
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:35,480
challenge I would say it was brought up

738
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:38,278
earlier

739
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,200
is there's more than one product that's

740
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:41,798
being made in a concentrate and the

741
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,639
question is what's the end product are

742
00:32:41,798 --> 00:32:45,398
you going to an edible are you going to

743
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:48,398
a vape cart are you going to something

744
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:51,158
that might be dabbable and there are

745
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:54,158
very few solvents that can span all of

746
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:57,880
those product categories um that really

747
00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:00,440
is the um the um the Lynch pin of it all

748
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,639
is being able to make all products at a

749
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,480
low

750
00:33:01,638 --> 00:33:06,798
cost thank you very much and I think we

751
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:10,200
are quite late but I think there one or

752
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:13,079
two questions are possible if uh there

753
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,000
are any questions from the audience are

754
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:16,000
there questions from the

755
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,320
audience did you all run out of ideas no

756
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:23,240
that's one question from the audience

757
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:25,960
two questions I hope so I hope some

758
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,319
cannabis clubs want to extract soon

759
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,440
we're not so experienced it's good to

760
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:31,589
have question here we go let's hear it

761
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,159
for the panel by the

762
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:36,240
[Applause]

763
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:39,600
way thanks I hope I don't butcher this

764
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,399
you mentioned uh Hol tube extraction Hol

765
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:43,959
core oh could you say something about

766
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:46,239
that out of yeah so it came from uh the

767
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:50,360
bachan oil fields uh it was a way to

768
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,159
separate the oil from the sand and um

769
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:54,638
it's proved to be expensive but again

770
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,320
you're threading the needle of cost and

771
00:33:54,638 --> 00:34:00,240
it is extremely expensive on the op on

772
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:02,319
the cap back side buying it up front um

773
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,079
and that's been the biggest barrier to

774
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:06,359
that particular

775
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:09,119
technology how does it

776
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:10,559
work we would need another 15 minutes

777
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,599
and I'd need a board to draw on to

778
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:16,358
explain it but um it's essentially

779
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,359
almost a microfiltration technology I'll

780
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:21,679
put it in that way all

781
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:23,878
right so the my question would be so the

782
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,200
most efficient way for the those

783
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:29,199
cannabis clubs in Germany would be this

784
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:31,519
trucken ice Tumbl and pressing this

785
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,759
would be the the best idea everybody

786
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:36,719
knocking heads like yeah

787
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,919
way it can be an easy and fast way to do

788
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:41,039
it if especially you have all this

789
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:43,598
limitation and until these limitations

790
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:46,000
are gone I guess it can be a good way to

791
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:49,679
do it they only consider the hash

792
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,079
product as a byproduct of extraction the

793
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,800
every way to make hash either by direct

794
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:57,200
press or through sifting or through

795
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,359
ultrasound even it's going to be

796
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:00,960
sufficient now of course efficiency is

797
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:02,799
not going to be there but at least it's

798
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,280
the first step it's going to be like

799
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,480
this is the first rule that rule going

800
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,920
to evolve it's going to be changed uh

801
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,400
and Depends of uh how that everything

802
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,320
going to start in the first few months

803
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,119
maybe they're going to be like all the

804
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,400
clubs going to write um proper response

805
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:21,519
to the ruling and that's going to be

806
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,200
voted in September or in the fall with

807
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:26,320
some changes but for now that's

808
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:29,960
unfortunately is the only simple way to

809
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,960
do it but I back uh here I must admit uh

810
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,920
German Germany is quite good in

811
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:39,400
engineering and I think one Club will

812
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:43,039
invent or uh uh build a mega Rosen press

813
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,838
you know like 5 m by 5 m you know where

814
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:47,119
they put where they can put half of the

815
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:49,199
Harvest on you know this this is what I

816
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,760
expect from the jble clubs here please

817
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:53,399
build a mega Rosen press because that's

818
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,839
in my eyes the only way to do it on

819
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,680
Commercial level you know so I built a

820
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:58,920
Ros and press in Washington state the

821
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:02,199
press two

822
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:04,200
kilos at a time with Boeing Engineers

823
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:05,679
whether that's good or bad I'm not sure

824
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:07,679
but as long as the doors don't fall off

825
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:09,639
of the press you'll be but the one the

826
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:12,279
one point I would like to make about all

827
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:14,879
hashes and rosins is that if you were a

828
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:17,000
gold miner and there was a a quarter of

829
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,800
an ounce of gold in your rock you're

830
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,639
only getting half about half of it out

831
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,079
and the only way to get that other half

832
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:27,598
out is to use some type of solvent and

833
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:29,599
when we pressed those rosins we would

834
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,920
take the bags we pressed it all the

835
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,559
biomass we' even scrape the plates and

836
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,159
we'd rerun that in a BHO or an ethanol

837
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,400
process to get the other half of the

838
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:38,399
gold

839
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,400
out fantastic are closing statements or

840
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,640
arguments you'd like to

841
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:50,680
make no any more questions from the

842
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:53,559
audience I was just there

843
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:56,519
microphone um one question especially

844
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:59,199
now for the German Social Clubs what do

845
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:03,519
you think about um especially if you use

846
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:06,078
tce for pressing to do a um separation

847
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:08,079
um electric separation

848
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,400
before sounds like an interesting

849
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,240
experiment let me know how it works out

850
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,240
for

851
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:16,399
you I mean really I I have to say you

852
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:18,838
know this entire industry is one big R&amp;D

853
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,318
project and uh none of us have all the

854
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:24,239
answers here so s seriously let us know

855
00:37:21,318 --> 00:37:26,159
how that works out so um the electrical

856
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,078
like what they call in the moment the

857
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:30,078
static sifting

858
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,839
I'm sorry can you repeat um the

859
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,200
technique they call in the moment the

860
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:36,000
static

861
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:38,078
sifting static sifting so like

862
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,719
hydrostatic extraction you know that

863
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,000
that has benefits but much like with

864
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:44,598
steam distillation which again is very

865
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,159
very effective um we find you lose what

866
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:48,480
we call your high notes and your low

867
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:51,199
notes and your Tarpin so you get more of

868
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,079
a blended tpine um you're going to lose

869
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:56,078
those sensations of a particular strain

870
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,960
and you may also uh do what we call

871
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,760
isomerized chemicals

872
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:03,838
um we actually in Washington state

873
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,839
invented a chemical uh called um um THC

874
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:08,358
THC EXC me

875
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:10,639
cbdt I believe was the chemical and it

876
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:12,239
was caused by too much heat you you're

877
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:15,679
changing the chemicals whenever you're

878
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:15,679
using heat and that's the

879
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,599
challenge okay thank you uh for your

880
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:24,519
expertise and especially for the German

881
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,280
clubs will listen uh listen very well

882
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:29,280
because when it comes to extraction we

883
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:31,440
have to learn a lot from uh the yeah

884
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,640
from all the guys over from overseas and

885
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:37,720
from Portugal of course thank you very

886
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:41,838
much let's here again Michael canote and

887
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:41,838
uh the rest of the panelists
