1
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:31,018
all the way all the way from build in

2
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,020
Germany it's not that far

3
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:37,619
so thank you for coming to the left

4
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:42,379
today so we got to be quick so we all

5
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:42,378
audio before that's that's official goal

6
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:48,058
yeah my name is endre part of network

7
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:49,799
for a company called open you mind

8
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,078
am I not a part of it it's weird

9
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:56,399
producer of these little small

10
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:59,100
unification pouches and we are really

11
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,170
like a small medium company from the

12
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,910
Midwestern United States and we would

13
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,728
not be able to participate in this

14
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:07,618
global market space if it wasn't for the

15
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:09,359
partnerships if we have the rough coat

16
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:12,180
so we have a small company at 30 people

17
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,260
and and Canada's just happened to us so

18
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,720
we originally from the steel industry

19
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,969
and all product what it does is you

20
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:20,489
throw it into any type of cost container

21
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:23,789
it would just keep the ability stable at

22
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:26,039
the high level for cannabis the highest

23
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,650
possible level would be under 65 percent

24
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,570
solution to two percent solution this

25
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,368
little pouch would give and remove

26
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:34,438
moisture at the same time it's all

27
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:36,118
natural based on the samosas and just

28
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:37,559
happened to be fantastic for cannabis

29
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:38,310
because when it dries out you lose all

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,590
terpenes

31
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:44,129
if you sell flow as to dry you lose

32
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,390
money if it's too moist you lose

33
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:47,039
everything Jamal that we just heard that

34
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,069
Lotus one of the worst thing you can

35
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,950
happen so I know we sell to companies

36
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:56,398
like Aurora Canada and that is fantastic

37
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:59,228
and all over the globe here Switzerland

38
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,820
and it would not be possible without

39
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:03,099
partnerships but all the partnerships

40
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:06,519
are strategic though you know many of

41
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:08,590
them are just pure like fires other

42
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:10,179
relationships but we do have some

43
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,830
realistic in scholarships and this is

44
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:14,500
something we want to discuss today at

45
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:16,360

so that's me in a nutshell my name is

79
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:09,060
Brad white I am CEO of GED global

80
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:15,250
Sciences were based out of Denver

81
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:19,959
started 2014-15 as a farm Strasburg

82
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:22,180
farms just east of the dia airport there

83
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,280
in Colorado and started to see the

84
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,259
compression of the market already you

85
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:28,929
know when we started out we were we saw

86
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:31,779
prices with $700 or pounds of growth CBD

87
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:37,230
enriched biomass and now we're down

88
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:40,989
around 50 to $60 per pound of it in 12%

89
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:43,600
CT biomass so very quickly we saw that

90
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:47,129
going vertical was going to be a very

91
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,960
strategic move we launched our first

92
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:52,870
brand which is Hill with the scan of oil

93
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:56,169
and now we have a Sports wellness brand

94
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:59,500
called 8x given up your insurgency on

95
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:02,350
the ethics it's um that operation you've

96
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,120
got lotions topicals all sorts of things

97
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,980
that are going to help you out when

98
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,500
you're trying to push out that last mile

99
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,930
as a marathon runner or whatever it is

100
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,029
that my lu8 you're going to exercise so

101
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:21,129
long yeah we're going to be going public

102
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:23,589
on the CSC in three weeks so here we go

103
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:26,139
all right thank you all so let's talk

104
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:29,289
about ggg-go lines as Bruce a so what

105
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:33,699
what type of strategic alliances did you

106
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:35,260
have that you did not value what did we

107
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:37,599
miss your teaching yeah that's obvious

108
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:39,339
but what did one of those like the most

109
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,379
outstanding teacher like if you guys

110
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:45,849
have or maybe have had in the past

111
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:48,930
there's no um for me when it comes to

112
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:51,939
just strategic partnerships or alliances

113
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:54,459
it's not you know per se Panama's

114
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:57,069
what kind of want to look for so I've

115
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:59,349
had in the past terrible strategic

116
00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:01,540
partnerships in Canada things that have

117
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:03,790
absolutely imploded aboard

118
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,580
I've seen everything over the 12 years

119
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:08,470
that I've been over in Canada moving

120
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:10,149
forward in a positive manner of

121
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,640
strategic partnerships what you want to

122
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:15,038
look for what you're looking for is to

123
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,509
not only save it in your own country

124
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,998
- look it aside to work within the

125
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:20,889
country people look at people who have

126
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:22,778
missing components that your company

127
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:24,930
being ordered at the table and you got

128
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:28,569
to also look at who they are as people

129
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:30,759
do your personalities do your moral

130
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:32,050
compasses also come alive because when

131
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:33,908
you're involved with these people you're

132
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,649
not to all of these people sometimes for

133
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:38,199
36 months when it comes to purchasing

134
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:40,059
like product you're sometimes involved

135
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,369
with these people brokers the 10 to 15

136
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:45,159
years when they get to compose that you

137
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:47,289
do your research on we're partnering

138
00:06:45,158 --> 00:06:49,269
with because you they're working for a

139
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:51,009
long time man from what I've learned

140
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:54,938
from not only mistakes that I made in

141
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:59,229
canvas in Canada because sometimes

142
00:06:54,939 --> 00:07:01,620
myself you really need to do your due

143
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:07,568
diligence and if you don't it can

144
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:10,449
quickly yeah maybe I can talk a bit

145
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:12,490
about the media aspect so I'm really

146
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:15,819
based on the recreational side of

147
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:17,889
cannabis and that's why I recently I

148
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:20,468
partnered up with the big medical

149
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:23,649
cannabis network so that we together you

150
00:07:20,468 --> 00:07:26,168
can cover on the medical side the

151
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:28,240
recreational side and for me it's also

152
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:31,240
important that the information that we

153
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,538
put out that we have found a good

154
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,728
background that we post or what we share

155
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:39,399
or the articles that we write the beep

156
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:40,990
that it's a chit and then when it comes

157
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:44,139
to the medical side that's an aspect

158
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:46,028
that I miss or that I'm not there or I'm

159
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:51,459
not to ever want to be so make sure that

160
00:07:46,028 --> 00:07:53,680
I work with its medical route its run by

161
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:56,709
doctors and then it's really the gene

162
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,158
and they also give me more more

163
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:04,120
knowledge more power and and admits it

164
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:07,028
look better and I just always look out

165
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:10,569
for partners that leverage of we don't

166
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:12,579
we also want leverage with issues so you

167
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:17,259
already want to go for this and you know

168
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:19,300
that's you don't need to go to medical

169
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:20,980
side of that oh why did you decide that

170
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:24,850
business an area there

171
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:28,000
like use into being like for me it's

172
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:30,490
always like I'm happiest when I can post

173
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,250
a video and see somebody who gets your

174
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,668
leaves make medical cannabis hits it

175
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:38,500
gives me more pleasure than just post up

176
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:40,329
getting high I know that's an important

177
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:46,080
aspect and I you want to get high as

178
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:50,740
well but like it's just you know

179
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:53,740
so you self-medicating against life oh I

180
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:56,289
don't smoke cannabis doing work but like

181
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,570
sometimes officer like a hard day I feel

182
00:08:56,289 --> 00:09:01,629
my head is exploding and I just want to

183
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:07,300
step back smoke a joint and relax and

184
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:09,039
therefore the next day after the

185
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:12,219
strategic partnership you know he's

186
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:14,259
gonna vertical business yeah we stay in

187
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:18,279
our lane but we pretty much own always

188
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:19,990
from seed to sale but for me a new

189
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:21,879
partnership is bringing in like the

190
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,310
large retailers that have never done

191
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:26,340
this in the u.s. before I mean we're

192
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:28,509
talking a lot of name brands that

193
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,639
they're how waiting on the sidelines is

194
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:33,970
yep it's going to do others are already

195
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:37,149
moving into the top so I'm helping them

196
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:40,149
and seeing how to educate the population

197
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:43,240
I mean if you look at the majority of

198
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:45,039
the non cannabis states in America right

199
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,549
now if you go and ask somebody what a

200
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:51,549
CTE it happens no clue that's painted up

201
00:09:48,549 --> 00:09:53,169
the man and once our retailers know that

202
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:56,469
that's sitting out there waiting for us

203
00:09:53,169 --> 00:10:00,339
to sell to their big very very strategic

204
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:03,190
in what we're doing 3 um so how do you

205
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:06,129
know you choose partners I mean you said

206
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,210
yes I mean so first of all where do you

207
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:14,350
find to change partners

208
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:26,310
other than nice to be yeah process you

209
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:29,810
know what's the first step well you know

210
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:33,989
if you meet people everywhere you go

211
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:36,989
ahem you gotta be you meet everyone so

212
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,789
firm it could be people in retail in

213
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,649
Canada when I was the CEO of energy

214
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:42,349
Canada it will be coming into the

215
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:45,149
dispensaries all the time so I would see

216
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,290
twenty thirty thousand equal week you

217
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:50,179
know some people are dropping off

218
00:10:46,289 --> 00:10:52,759
product the people are some people are

219
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:55,198
introducing new products to the market

220
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:57,899
you know you take the cards either

221
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:59,969
contact me the stuff is getting it up

222
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,970
there and speaking and publicly talking

223
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:07,079
about who your brand is marketing

224
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:09,778
essentially having a public base to your

225
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:12,778
brand is important and getting out there

226
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:14,370
and like I said earlier doing your due

227
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:16,049
diligence on the brands out you connect

228
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,970
with something and going after it

229
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:19,679
because you can't do this all of them

230
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,480
like this industry is so massive like

231
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,359
like you were saying as soon as like a

232
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,039
retail sees something as a ended up

233
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,778
demand there they instantly want

234
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,870
vertically innovate with you I think

235
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:33,419
that's important with any of that us for

236
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:37,318
me company X is a strategic partnership

237
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:39,539
it's two amazing companies that if form

238
00:11:37,318 --> 00:11:42,028
not formed their own entities that have

239
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:44,789
going together to distribute other to do

240
00:11:42,028 --> 00:11:46,289
distributions and you know work with

241
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:49,469
different countries and grow hemp all

242
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:52,860
over the world and each person on my

243
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:57,540
board that makes up company X is my

244
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:59,190
strategic partner without my partners I

245
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:02,219
cannot get them today they all

246
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:04,079
specialize in one major thing relative

247
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,819
perfidy multiple major things and we all

248
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:09,568
stand Arlene and we use are synergies

249
00:12:05,818 --> 00:12:10,948
become great of what we do to me I guess

250
00:12:09,568 --> 00:12:12,719
that's the best example of what a

251
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:15,000
strategic partnership is for me because

252
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,399
my board is one big strategic

253
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,350
partnership and we're very blessed

254
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:22,139
because we get to use all of our

255
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:23,399
resources mind contained in other parts

256
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:25,079
of the world that I've worked with all

257
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:26,399
the people from Switzerland who work in

258
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,620
multiple different countries throughout

259
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,169
the EU when we get to blend them into

260
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,480
company accent work with everyone and to

261
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:36,370
me that is a major important part and

262
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:40,720
I'm blessed that actually have some

263
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:42,149
but I think a very important aspect you

264
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,639
need to have a good overview of

265
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:47,769
tumescent in this market um what are the

266
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:50,589
top four years going to the expo and

267
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:53,230
then stuff like ICBC me that people who

268
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:55,269
are basically operating in the same

269
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,829
field as you are you have to talk to

270
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:59,769
them you have to get their name out

271
00:12:56,828 --> 00:13:02,349
there build your brand and as soon as

272
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:02,649
you do that you will find out soon

273
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,829
enough

274
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:08,438
like who proved to be you either get a

275
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:14,169
great bit to form such as a chichi

276
00:13:08,438 --> 00:13:21,969
partnership when we know the next step

277
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:23,378
so we found a partnership a mutual

278
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:27,278
benefit

279
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:29,289
so for example I described the the

280
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:32,948
retailers coming to us looking for

281
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:35,259
information but you know there's also a

282
00:13:32,948 --> 00:13:38,109
need our part you know for example on

283
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:40,269
how to connect to their back-end systems

284
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,308
so that they can press a button and

285
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:45,159
order straight to our system

286
00:13:42,308 --> 00:13:48,100
we have to have them set up with you can

287
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:50,198
see young on the the actual product

288
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,720
itself you know so that it meets all of

289
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:54,308
their standards we have to lean on our

290
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,069
strategic partners just like very you

291
00:13:54,308 --> 00:13:59,350
know a so if it's a society right so you

292
00:13:57,068 --> 00:14:03,009
know you say how do you go look for them

293
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:04,569
it's a mean and then the usually will

294
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,490
come with the same kind of thing once

295
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:09,099
you introduce yourself as hey this is

296
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:11,889
what I have already made react it can

297
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:14,678
add one example so we are sending to a

298
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:16,480
company that is in FMCG so fast moving

299
00:14:14,678 --> 00:14:17,889
consumer goods and of course is it's

300
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,740
just the bias of the relationship that

301
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:22,749
we had in beginning with they I mean we

302
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,269
help them keeping their product in

303
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:29,879
perfect condition the same times this

304
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:32,678
super highly automated you know it has

305
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:35,350
most new challenges a rough you know

306
00:14:32,678 --> 00:14:37,028
tuna at our product per se but the way

307
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,949
we deliver these products that it has to

308
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:41,289
go into fully automated machineries at

309
00:14:38,948 --> 00:14:43,979
high speed for instance you know so and

310
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:45,899
this partnership now brings us into

311
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,509
position to actually go after more

312
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:50,750
markets you know this is why this is

313
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:54,240
probably what you mean the beneficial

314
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:56,629
like mucho benefit you know in any type

315
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,610
of thing so probably three in that um

316
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:03,029
what would you think were like the most

317
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:06,090
valuable strategic partnerships if you

318
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:12,990
have this can be highly you know

319
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:15,780
individual you know it's maybe not okay

320
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:18,659
so from the past in his head sounds we

321
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:20,370
were busy sitting up here about one of

322
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:20,850
my biggest strategic partnerships was

323
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:24,899
bolita

324
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:28,139
when I ran retail in Canada we had major

325
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:29,730
issues with the Canada staying fresh and

326
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,559
having all of the cannabis industry in

327
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:34,409
Canada that was on the retail so I could

328
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:37,619
agree with that as he said to repeat Rio

329
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:41,549
Laver disappears THC levels drop and or

330
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:44,340
rise cannabinoids disappear and it was a

331
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:46,679
major issue for brand at one point it

332
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:48,629
was actually affecting everything from

333
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,669
the waiver growing or trying different

334
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:52,439
styles we didn't know what to do and

335
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:54,240
then for packaging they're trying to

336
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,550
after thing and spending money there and

337
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,990
then you know it gets to a point where

338
00:15:56,549 --> 00:16:00,209
they're losing sales we need to do

339
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,750
something and we started working with

340
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:04,110
Boveda

341
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:06,120
and we were purchasing many many amounts

342
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:08,550
of taxable emissions by eleven stores

343
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,129
across Canada and it was sixty five

344
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:13,439
thousand because we were represented as

345
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:16,230
a medicinal cannabis grant wellness

346
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,450
patients and as soon as we started

347
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:21,360
putting the Mojito packs into our

348
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:23,550
cannabis if we keep it fresh or at least

349
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,110
met in a couple weeks at a time to

350
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,429
preserve the cannabis that we were

351
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,139
giving to patients that needed the most

352
00:16:26,429 --> 00:16:30,539
high-end quality because that's what

353
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:32,759
happens in Canada was no tours we

354
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:35,730
specialized in having the top following

355
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,769
in Canada and once it started to drop to

356
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,750
drop drastically in different climates

357
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:42,750
we had to figure of what to do and we

358
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:44,789
didn't know and there now oh he was

359
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:47,039
there and it was like I'm never you met

360
00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:49,069
him today the enemy determined it's true

361
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,588
as we definitely

362
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:53,060
this is not staged they see River but

363
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:55,220
it's literally I was like oh my god you

364
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:58,849
drove eat it like that we used you

365
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:00,949
forever and it's it's really neat on on

366
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,659
what it did for it and even though he

367
00:17:00,948 --> 00:17:04,609
isn't talking with the symphysis that

368
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:06,139
Egypt partnership was one of the

369
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:08,328
smartest place and I'm dedicated that

370
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,919
ever did because of Reid Motor Sales

371
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:11,720
back to where they were the hair out of

372
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,309
the peak because their candidates became

373
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,838
pressured again or all these went back

374
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:16,459
to where we were you started making

375
00:17:14,838 --> 00:17:18,980
multiple awards and the quality of

376
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:20,600
product that award ceremonies do so it

377
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:24,349
really helped us along to get to where

378
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:26,719
we were um tell you an example I have a

379
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:28,789
partnership with a company called

380
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,610
Wickham order they are based in a very

381
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:34,548
under why do you needing um branding

382
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:37,579
agency in the cannabis space so uh a

383
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:40,400
couple months ago we post a video

384
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:43,879
material and his video reach like three

385
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,250
million people within a week um the CEO

386
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,760
is MIA and I would like thank you very

387
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:52,069
much for the wise video how can we work

388
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:55,190
together so what we did we put an

389
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:57,710
agreement in place where they can you

390
00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:01,400
remind met work for their clients and

391
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:03,950
apparently helped me to really improve

392
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,919
the branding of highlight media so they

393
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,840
looked at all the assets we have and

394
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,690
then they proved it and and it's not

395
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:15,519
worth to get around that and uh another

396
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:19,640
example is we started to sell long

397
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:20,179
company I own equity in is on CBD dog

398
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,400
treats

399
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:27,980
and we have a partnership with the

400
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:30,290
university rock they helped us to form I

401
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:33,319
eat snacks together with veterinarians

402
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:36,678
and now we're running a clinical studies

403
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:38,779
there and so like I said this is a

404
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:40,880
scientific background that you need when

405
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:42,829
you sell medical cannabis if you ask me

406
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,530
I just I don't want to pull out a

407
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:47,928
product and then don't know what happens

408
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:51,500
when you like administrate the doc so

409
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:53,900
like it needs work and we need to make

410
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,069
sure it works and we think the

411
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,380
universities

412
00:18:55,069 --> 00:18:59,059
right partner to like really give us the

413
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,370
scientific background to make that

414
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:03,619
happen

415
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:08,019
yeah so probably one of our distributors

416
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:11,779
at Henry's one of the smaller here

417
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:13,730
servers throughout Alexis you pay for

418
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:15,849
one company to handle but you know

419
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:21,049
they've got 400 salespeople they go out

420
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:24,019
and when we actually started to above

421
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:27,049
our information into their system we

422
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:29,230
realize just how far away's were being

423
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:33,200
able to work with the larger beginners

424
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:36,170
so they got to school us up got us ready

425
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:40,100
for that from the systems that we were

426
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:44,870
using how we're labeling you know you

427
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:47,149
name and that was pretty strategic you

428
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:50,019
know the timing wise you know everyone

429
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:53,600
in the US wants to try to be so young

430
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:57,440
and it gets worse and more market

431
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:59,899
so relations up in time tomorrow it's

432
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,789
more and more intuitive you know but the

433
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:05,660
pressure that's rising evening this

434
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:07,159
movie almost a lot of everybody needs to

435
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:09,290
boom industry but there's a burden that

436
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,300
comes with we're sure were and so Gigi

437
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:18,799
the line so she punches play a big role

438
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:22,129
in them um so the last partition that

439
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:24,409
you have water so basically it was like

440
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:26,300
I like a test project and you guys did

441
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:28,160
order some so you didn't even want you

442
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:30,289
to have the strategic partnership with

443
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,600
these guys or is it good enough so I

444
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:34,309
accident or is this really that you want

445
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:36,289
to have a shitty partnership and then do

446
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:39,529
like a test project which is very wise

447
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:42,079
thing to do in my opinion it happened by

448
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:44,210
accident but after the video my brother

449
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,279
like that sense we don't contacted me we

450
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,049
had a talk for like 15 minutes and he

451
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:50,500
was like I want to buy your company and

452
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:53,539
then I was like it's not gonna happen so

453
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,669
he was like how can we work together on

454
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:59,509
how you know please yeah

455
00:20:55,669 --> 00:21:02,278
when you approach that I mean it is and

456
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:04,679
that's how we started it was not a

457
00:21:02,278 --> 00:21:08,009
partnership that that I was actively

458
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:11,159
looking for but that's what I said

459
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:13,528
beginning if you have these Expos if you

460
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:15,570
talk to the right people like it's gonna

461
00:21:13,528 --> 00:21:17,909
pop up and it's gonna happen and then

462
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:20,128
you you just need to like go to these

463
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:23,009
events in turn if your name out there if

464
00:21:20,128 --> 00:21:27,329
your brand out there and then make it

465
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:29,278
happen yeah so what's the first step

466
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:35,509
you look like this test project maybe or

467
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:39,628
why do you start this yeah I would say

468
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:41,368
well would we identify a need or our

469
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:44,579
confidence as well I'll start looking

470
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:51,089
for that partner whether it's finding

471
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:53,849
better genetics or moving land or grows

472
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:56,730
two different locations to mitigate the

473
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:58,740
risk from natural disasters such as

474
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:01,788
storms and hail things like that

475
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:04,138
so those are all opportunities you know

476
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:07,499
much like what we're all here together

477
00:22:04,138 --> 00:22:10,678
you know we're networking but that works

478
00:22:07,499 --> 00:22:12,329
fine people that may have something of

479
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,980
interest and you never know what they're

480
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:16,678
going to come up with because they may

481
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:20,819
have a need on their side that you can

482
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:22,820
fill pretty quickly um for myself and

483
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:25,200
I'll use company X in is the example of

484
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:28,499
partnership because of these two

485
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,149
companies that work together on this

486
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:32,610
joint venture of distribution and

487
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:34,589
extraction and you know we use the

488
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:36,209
assets of both companies while

489
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:37,798
distributing to company X and we use

490
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:41,850
those products and all most of them to

491
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:47,220
grow and to me having two different

492
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:50,158
companies working together and using the

493
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,960
specialties of each person is important

494
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,309
but when it started it started off

495
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,778
slowly it was you know conversations

496
00:22:55,308 --> 00:23:00,148
early banter then you get more serious

497
00:22:57,778 --> 00:23:01,470
as time goes on and you start learning

498
00:23:00,148 --> 00:23:03,719
more and more about these people and

499
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:05,339
then you take the next step forward but

500
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,679
they think it's important that again

501
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:08,970
your due diligence with needs edit the

502
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,090
bed with these people because it could

503
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:14,249
be for a very long time and you know if

504
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:16,138
you do all the steps and you cross all

505
00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:18,120
the t's and dot the i's and you know

506
00:23:16,138 --> 00:23:21,689
these people and do it as a procession

507
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:25,128
in people they need to rush it's like

508
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:27,720
your degrees I constantly don't you rush

509
00:23:25,128 --> 00:23:29,490
you're gonna burn yourself up and you're

510
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,710
gonna end yourself in the industry

511
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:33,298
telling me that now you're talking to a

512
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:36,538
person who almost did it to himself

513
00:23:33,298 --> 00:23:38,519
last year it's important that you get to

514
00:23:36,538 --> 00:23:40,138
know these people because you're gonna

515
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:41,700
be spending a lot of time about it's

516
00:23:40,138 --> 00:23:44,219
important that you know the morals and

517
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,200
everything makes sense into me I'm very

518
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,850
lucky that when both these companies

519
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,690
that work together under the umbrella

520
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:52,829
company acts all the personalities and

521
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:55,590
all the things that they brought to the

522
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:57,388
table we've got one person who's special

523
00:23:55,589 --> 00:23:59,398
sighs the next person you know that so

524
00:23:57,388 --> 00:24:02,638
if someone that educates of medicinal

525
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:04,859
cannabis I'd use Association as much as

526
00:24:02,638 --> 00:24:08,998
vineyard they have an extraction because

527
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:10,589
it's to me that's it was important the

528
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:11,850
stages that we took and if you're

529
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:14,368
something that I didn't do before

530
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:16,740
so I actually learned so much from this

531
00:24:14,368 --> 00:24:19,079
process because they initiated it and

532
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,028
then included me and after so it was an

533
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:22,678
amazing process to watch because the

534
00:24:21,028 --> 00:24:25,470
Europeans did in a completely different

535
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:27,749
way and I never had it done in North

536
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:29,249
America and I learned so much because it

537
00:24:27,749 --> 00:24:31,200
was a more humbling way of when they

538
00:24:29,249 --> 00:24:32,788
thought it was more common way the way

539
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,399
that people are that I work with are a

540
00:24:32,788 --> 00:24:37,829
lot different it myself just in general

541
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:40,768
that's in general born in North America

542
00:24:37,829 --> 00:24:42,868
and to me if you can learn from these

543
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:44,519
people and grow off these people you can

544
00:24:42,868 --> 00:24:49,048
create some amazing synergies and

545
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:51,210
awesome strategic goals and or you know

546
00:24:49,048 --> 00:24:57,058
eventually those be sales and mutual

547
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:59,879
benefits from one others alright so just

548
00:24:57,058 --> 00:25:02,009
last round of questions did you mention

549
00:24:59,878 --> 00:25:05,609
it some of the partnership they went at

550
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:08,630
so just like juice of two sentences what

551
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:11,659
were like the worries like the ships

552
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,100
if you have an idea of it I was working

553
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,259
with the City of Hamilton trying to

554
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:17,839
educate them on regulating retail

555
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:19,430
dispensaries and the very end new stuff

556
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:26,929
tonight for my back I just simply said

557
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:30,769
see you later alligator I know my

558
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:31,789
crumpet okay get to the point of banning

559
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:34,490
the people that you're going to work

560
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:36,230
with there's a lot of sharks that are

561
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:38,720
swimming around our industry and

562
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:41,150
throughout you really have to do your

563
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,910
due diligence and betting them and it's

564
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:46,450
not just about fruitful funds if you

565
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:48,800
don't trust them going right into it and

566
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:51,620
yeah I mean we've been a strategic

567
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:54,980
partnership well over a 10 million

568
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:58,909
dollar contract that went sideways and

569
00:25:54,980 --> 00:26:01,460
it was litigated so you know there's

570
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:03,890
there's pieces chew you're betting that

571
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,350
you have to do on the front side you

572
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:08,990
cannot assume in this industry that or

573
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:13,909
good or look out for your best interest

574
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:17,150
this could also be huncles I don't know

575
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:19,580
if I'm Swiss or it's because I have a

576
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:20,810
legal background but I just if I start a

577
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:23,269
partnership I want to have a good

578
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:26,089
agreement in place and that makes it a

579
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:28,250
lot easier afterwards if things don't

580
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:30,919
work out and this is going to happen but

581
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:33,109
so far we didn't have like super van

582
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,810
experience but sometimes after a couple

583
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:38,000
among shoes you feel or you start to see

584
00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:39,289
that it's not working out and then

585
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,599
you're gonna be happy you have a

586
00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:43,039
straight contract everything is black

587
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:47,000
and white and you're gonna have a lot

588
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:48,680
less problem later on contractors but

589
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,579
when you start talking to people there's

590
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:55,100
so many times

591
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:57,019
alright thank you okay that book

592
00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:58,250
publication with one question one wife

593
00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:00,519
says I want to have a brief question

594
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:03,048
every

595
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:06,139
hi sweetie I'm from spring-green

596
00:27:03,048 --> 00:27:08,929
magazine in the UK for each of you what

597
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:11,900
do you think is the best information we

598
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:13,790
can give to the end-user to empower them

599
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,620
through this whole process as I say it's

600
00:27:13,789 --> 00:27:19,029
surrounded by sharks have the new power

601
00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:24,229
the end user what they need to know

602
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:26,539
yourselves and don't allow the industry

603
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:29,960
to changing you become to fit into their

604
00:27:26,539 --> 00:27:32,000
their circle it doesn't fit simply

605
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:35,240
become amicable along the way don't

606
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,089
force yourself into a scenario there are

607
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,539
thousands and thousands of companies

608
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:41,808
include everyone

609
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:43,759
women transgender ethnic groups it

610
00:27:41,808 --> 00:27:45,829
doesn't matter itself just make sure

611
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:47,839
that you include people and make sure

612
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:50,298
that you don't rush into something or do

613
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:52,759
something to change your view are to get

614
00:27:50,298 --> 00:27:57,349
a business deal done because in the end

615
00:27:52,759 --> 00:28:00,079
is in the back part on yourself remains

616
00:27:57,349 --> 00:28:02,839
really you have to have very clear

617
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:06,470
vision of what you want to achieve and

618
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:08,298
you can never you know read oshi eight

619
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,789
the quality of relationship you know it

620
00:28:08,298 --> 00:28:12,980
has to be okay they can be ups and downs

621
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:18,859
but at the end it just isn't something

622
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:20,630
that you have to look for each other you

623
00:28:18,859 --> 00:28:25,359
know everything else if you have a solid

624
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:28,580
foundation with people you work with I

625
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:31,729
would say try to mitigate all

626
00:28:28,579 --> 00:28:34,399
assumptions usually that's where people

627
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:37,759
become disappointed is when you make an

628
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:40,610
assumption and it doesn't go the way

629
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:42,379
that one party or the other didn't

630
00:28:40,609 --> 00:28:45,259
expected because an assumption was later

631
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:47,290
allowed to stay there you're mentioning

632
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:49,400
contracts it's a perfect way to

633
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:52,009
assumption that on the table and

634
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:55,130
squashing because that usually work this

635
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:56,450
wouldn't happen for me it's like you

636
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,990
have to be honest you have to be

637
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:00,558
transparent and then

638
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,558
again

639
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:06,909
