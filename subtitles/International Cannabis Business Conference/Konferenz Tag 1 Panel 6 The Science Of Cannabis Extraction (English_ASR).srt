00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,540
yeah thank you very much welcome to our

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:08,580
panel about cannabis extraction my name

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,400
is Michael Knott I'm a freelance

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,859
journalist author of and author of The

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,859
so far only book in German language

6
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:17,839
about cannabis extraction which is this

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,679
one

8
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:25,679
and so I felt competent to moderate this

9
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,539
panel and have a lot of four very

10
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,559
competent guests from the Cannabis

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,740
industry

12
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,780
and I want to start I have to look at my

13
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,879
note I'm sorry I want to start with the

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,520
president of the decimal decimal

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,140
engineered systems which is the

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,239
oregon-based market leader in commercial

17
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:48,239
extraction system for cannabis and hemp

18
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:50,099
Jonah Baba welcome and Jonah could you

19
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,779
tell us about the background of your

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,500
company what are you doing what's your

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,500
everydays business

22
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:57,659
oh

23
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,719
yeah so we actually started back in 2012

24
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,399
from an analytical cannabis uh testing

25
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,219
standpoint we helped set the standards

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,260
for uh testing hemp and cannabis in the

27
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:13,099
U.S and then we actually started making

28
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,180
CO2 equipment based off of test results

29
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:17,579
just to have more consistency and

30
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,159
repeatability implementing Automation

31
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:22,798
and then we've continued to evolve with

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,520
to ethanol hydrocarbon distillation

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,759
isolation with a focus on automation for

34
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:31,618
more repeatability less Manpower and

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,659
then now a focus of course on compliancy

36
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:35,299
of EU GMP

37
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:40,020
thank you very much

38
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:42,259
next to Jonah we have Nick the last uh

39
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:42,259
hello

40
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,859
thank you very much you founded

41
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,200
collaboris in 2019 which is uh um for a

42
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:53,879
medical distribute of leading

43
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,560
manufacturer foreign services for

44
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,379
specializing on the medical cannabis

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,240
sector so what's your daily business

46
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:01,978
when it comes to extraction or how are

47
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,919
you connected with the extraction

48
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:06,959
business yeah we represent a very

49
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,300
reputable manufacturer for extraction

50
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,939
for CO2 extraction from Europe

51
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,099
and we like to propose this as the main

52
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:16,079
proposal from our company combined with

53
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:17,159
a closed system for winterization and

54
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,040
the waxing

55
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:22,259
other than that of course we can offer

56
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:24,239
other extraction methods like ethanol

57
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:26,519
like water extraction or even Vapor

58
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,860
static which is a new thing for us but

59
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,260
our main proposal is the CO2 extraction

60
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,840
with a closed system for winterization

61
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:36,120
and the waxing coming after that and

62
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,860
here company cannabreeze is based in

63
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,060
Greece as well yeah it's based in Athens

64
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,239
Greece

65
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,280
as you know we have a local medical

66
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,739
cannabis framework and some Investments

67
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,800
happening and in Greece you need to do

68
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:52,140
everything from cultivation processing

69
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,480
packaging and you need to have a

70
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:57,839
facility that does everything so that

71
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,759
was one of the motivations for us to

72
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,739
offer all the solutions for the

73
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:05,159
cultivation to extraction to packaging

74
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:07,980
in order to help our local projects and

75
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:10,439
this of course allowed us to enter other

76
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:12,479
markets like Israel like North Macedonia

77
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:15,419
that were more mature markets than the

78
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,340
Greek market and of course afterwards we

79
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:18,839
expanded to Malta Switzerland and

80
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,598
hopefully we're gonna get

81
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,840
towards the West a bit more

82
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:27,179
very sold the Box Macedonian Market is

83
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,939
already a player in in the game yes of

84
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:33,180
course uh the company that we represent

85
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:37,139
has already five or six CO2 extraction

86
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:39,300
systems working and installed and it's

87
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:41,579
an active market and it's been growing

88
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,439
up of course you know they're some

89
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,719
facilities that are more successful than

90
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,459
others but it's considered a mature

91
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:49,259
market for us and it's closed on

92
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,840
neighborhood we can drive there

93
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:54,239
and it's a big Market actually

94
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,200
thank you Nick come back to that later

95
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,239
next to Nick we have a doctor george

96
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:01,859
stun Chef did I pronounce it the right

97
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,620
way that's correct thank you very much

98
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,900
you're an entrepreneur and CEO of a very

99
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,658
Innovative cannabis extraction company

100
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,060
uh tell me more about the background of

101
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:14,818
your company please

102
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,819
Soviet European company out of Bulgaria

103
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:19,798
25 years experience in Botanical

104
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:22,500
extraction we got into the Cannabis

105
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:26,399
industry by accident literally 10 years

106
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:30,660
ago and we have U.S office of extraction

107
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:33,478
and sales we're most famous as pure five

108
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:38,240
extraction Purity in five senses were

109
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:41,399
known for building system based on a

110
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,918
134a aerosol which is extremely

111
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:46,258
selective solvent and extracts High

112
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,959
Turpin profile with full carbonide

113
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:51,120
profile about 85 potency no need for

114
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:54,359
winterization no need for any

115
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,759
post-processing so that's literally our

116
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,979
biggest advantage in the industry being

117
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,900
there we've seen a lot into the Cannabis

118
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:02,819
Market

119
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:06,179
even we make some other systems like

120
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:08,459
ethanol hexane we really focused on what

121
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,879
gives the best value to the market

122
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:14,459
and your company is based in

123
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,219
the U.S company is based in Arizona

124
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:20,039
thank you we have offices in Colorado

125
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:23,699
Pennsylvania Oregon and California where

126
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,439
we extract also cannabis and hemp the

127
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,740
factory is still in Bulgaria so we built

128
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:31,379
everything in European Union

129
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:35,639
interesting and to my left we have Dr

130
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:38,819
Joe Thompson who already put up a lot of

131
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:41,160
or enabled a lot of companies to be a

132
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:42,740
part of the instruction of the

133
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,380
instruction

134
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,819
Bronx in in the USA please tell me more

135
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:51,600
about your company in the background

136
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:55,560
yeah so we spent uh basically we got

137
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,979
started in 2014 we have 132

138
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,740
installations total not specifically

139
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:03,899
only extraction but we do extraction

140
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,978
distillation we have a lot of

141
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:07,258
chromatography preparative

142
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:10,258
chromatography where materials company

143
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:12,300
so we do selective materials our primary

144
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:15,060
focus these days is just servicing

145
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:18,180
clinical trials we're doing phase one

146
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:22,379
phase two clinical trial support CMO

147
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:24,300
type work and that's been really a good

148
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:28,079
direction I think for the industry in

149
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:31,139
general we know that extract action

150
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:35,219
systems alone are really not not

151
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:37,439
adequate for you know for the the market

152
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,759
you need to have you need to be able to

153
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,759
refine those you need to be able to

154
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:45,419
purify them and full contained systems

155
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,819
fully automated systems so our whole

156
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:50,579
entire approach is a holistic approach

157
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:53,819
that it really is fully contained

158
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:55,198
systems basically from extraction all

159
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,340
the way through to isolate from

160
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,500
extraction all the way through to

161
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:00,478
chromatography 100 contained nobody

162
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,600
touches it and it goes right through

163
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:05,339
fully CIP system enabled so that you can

164
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,020
clean it out with just the push of the

165
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:09,538
button so that those are what we're

166
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:10,740
really working on and and we've been

167
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:13,560
making those for pharmaceutical

168
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,600
companies primarily so we don't we

169
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,819
haven't serviced the recreational Market

170
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,240
in several years

171
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:24,479
yes uh thank you very much when it comes

172
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:27,060
to Germany I maybe have to explain that

173
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:29,519
we are not on the level like in the U.S

174
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,699
or in Canada when it comes to attraction

175
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:35,758
because our medical law does not allow

176
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:39,120
the same extractions or the same

177
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:42,660
extraction a product for patient as the

178
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,759
U.S or the Canadian law allows so our

179
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:48,120
extractions here in Germany so far are

180
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,979
limited to 25 in the pharmacy this is

181
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,379
why German companies are not so

182
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:55,740
experienced in that and we choose a lot

183
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:58,560
of uh over experts from overseas and

184
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,900
please let me ask Jonah we there are a

185
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,019
lot of different ways to extract

186
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:06,359
cannabis which is the most popular way

187
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:08,758
to extract cannabis for a company in

188
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,680
Oregon or in the US

189
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,439
so when it comes to extraction there's

190
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,939
no one perfect extraction method I think

191
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,978
that's important to understand anyone

192
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:18,598
that's just trying to sell you a

193
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:20,399
specific piece of equipment without

194
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,740
understanding you know what your

195
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,659
specific needs and goals are is not

196
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,759
going to be set up for success and so I

197
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,259
think the way we approach it

198
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,360
we actually engage with the customer

199
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:31,680
essentially reverse engineer what their

200
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,418
goals are so we talked to them about

201
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,979
what kind of products do you want to

202
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:36,179
make what's kind of your through foot

203
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,580
what's your throughput you're looking

204
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:40,559
for what's your budget what kind of

205
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,879
accreditations do you need and then we

206
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,579
actually reverse engineer the whole

207
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:46,799
thing essentially TurnKey even if you

208
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,839
need like C1 D1 rooms and all the

209
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,059
equipment all the way from the beginning

210
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,519
extraction all the way to again

211
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:54,659
distillation or isolation I'd say right

212
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,700
now

213
00:08:54,659 --> 00:09:00,059
in Oregon probably the most popular is

214
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:02,220
BHO now initially it was CO2 because CO2

215
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:03,859
was generally recognized as probably the

216
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,940
most safest extraction

217
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,860
jurisdictional and municipalities also

218
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,720
felt most comfortable with that and also

219
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,180
from a customer base just people

220
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,740
thinking it was you know the solvent

221
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:15,599
with CO2 just made them feel more

222
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,459
comfortable now that the Market's been

223
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,080
more educated and understand that you

224
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:21,419
know hydrocarbon really isn't dangerous

225
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,040
if done properly that's become more

226
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:26,039
popular just because of the versatility

227
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:29,819
as far as being able to do you know you

228
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:33,240
can do dry fresh frozen you can make

229
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:36,240
dabs now you can also make shatters and

230
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,560
also vape pens and also distillate so it

231
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,019
really covers a lot of the basis even

232
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,819
from a cost standpoint as well too but

233
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:43,919
then if customers are gonna then we have

234
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,839
hemp customers though that would like to

235
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,759
make you know do ten thousand pounds a

236
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,260
day and want to make all distal and

237
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,000
isolate and for something like that then

238
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:52,919
we're going to go like a large ethanol

239
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,600
system so it's really just Project

240
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:56,278
Specific is how we look at it we're

241
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,860
really try to partner with our customers

242
00:09:56,278 --> 00:10:00,958
to understand their needs and and tailor

243
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,379
something specifically for them

244
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:08,399
thanks Jonah Nick as a European

245
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:10,679
extractor would you agree uh why what do

246
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,379
you think why do you think we do in

247
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:16,259
Europe we mostly do CO2 extraction

248
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:19,860
sometimes you do ethanol yeah but BHO or

249
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:23,159
P even p-h-o is not attractive why is

250
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,778
that so from what we've seen so far most

251
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:27,719
of the requests and most of the

252
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:30,539
Investments depending at this moment are

253
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,519
with the CO2 extraction method

254
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:34,559
of course we get requests and they are

255
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,778
investments with the ethanol as a method

256
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,059
it's well established as well but at the

257
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:41,399
smaller number and now we start to see

258
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:44,099
some requests for water extraction which

259
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:46,200
I think is also interesting and a little

260
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,600
bit of vapor static but mainly the

261
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:52,140
requests we receive is for CO2

262
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:55,200
extraction much less ethanol and let's

263
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:57,480
say water extraction is start to picking

264
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,759
up and be part of the discussion which

265
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,100
is quite an established method for the

266
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,740
recreational Market in the U.S in Canada

267
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,899
and we understand the reasons why they

268
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,959
want to approach it and it could be a

269
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:12,000
cheap solution not an investment a high

270
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:14,000
investment and it's quick and it uses

271
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,458
water so

272
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,320
may that be maybe because the Terps and

273
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:22,199
the German or in the European Medical

274
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,620
Market the terpenes do not play a major

275
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,899
role no George would you agree if I if I

276
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,720
say that may be a case because if

277
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:33,059
terpenes do not play a major role the

278
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,579
method of extraction is not so important

279
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:37,439
how's the experience in the U.S states

280
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:40,019
you're working at

281
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,760
yeah one of the things that is important

282
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:45,419
obviously is the stability of the

283
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:47,759
extract especially in a GMP setting and

284
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:49,919
when you have terpenes in the GMP

285
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,200
extract there that is not a stable

286
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:55,019
extract and so from the standpoint of

287
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,720
GMP it's really not allowed in fact we

288
00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:00,720
know from the FDA trials with sativax

289
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,180
for example which failed what primarily

290
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,560
because of those terpenes that were in

291
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:06,299
there and the background and the

292
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,359
unknowns that were being generated so

293
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:11,219
when you think about a clinical a

294
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,980
clinical like a Pharma type a clinical

295
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,600
mindset you're typically looking to get

296
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,759
an extract that's as clean as possible

297
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,879
that's as stable as possible the Shelf

298
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:23,278
stable and that's why uh it's that's why

299
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,500
it's important to have you know multiple

300
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,778
different means to purify your your

301
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,419
extracts not only to the extracts we can

302
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:32,759
all talk about different ways to extract

303
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:34,740
but uh you know ultimately it has to be

304
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:36,778
purified it has to be formulated like

305
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,720
you said 25 only is allowed that's a

306
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:41,458
formulated extra right

307
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,240
if we look to Colorado droughts for

308
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:45,899
example

309
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,539
um is that do which are all do terpenes

310
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:50,519
play do they play a major role or do

311
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:53,480
kind of cannabis play the major role

312
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,480
when it comes to extraction

313
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,360
Entourage effect is very important

314
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:02,760
um usually terpenes are a multiplier

315
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,740
with right serpents in there you really

316
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:07,319
can turn them out like one plus one

317
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,299
makes four because they really make that

318
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,220
extract more bioavailable and the

319
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:13,019
turpins they manipulate the cannabinoids

320
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,180
into the proper way I've been talking to

321
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:17,519
a lot of patients from Oregon and

322
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:20,399
Colorado when I did the first stage when

323
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,839
they became legal and they recognized

324
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,639
that this drink can help him for this

325
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,079
this thing can help him for that and the

326
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,480
difference in between strain is really

327
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:29,819
the chirps helping profile they're about

328
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,579
30 000 trips in nature and they're about

329
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:35,100
300 troops no known in cannabis in

330
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:37,620
combination between them they amplify

331
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,180
the effect a lot so chirps they play a

332
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,578
major role and

333
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:43,679
there's a lot to talk about it like uh

334
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:45,958
looking at U.S markets we've learned a

335
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:48,778
lot so how that market evolved starting

336
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:51,059
from uh accrued from like Simpson going

337
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:52,458
through distillers going through

338
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:55,018
um

339
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:57,539
enhanced Botanical extraction like

340
00:13:55,019 --> 00:14:00,299
Botanical terpenes that's all about

341
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:02,159
experience and adding the right terms

342
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:03,299
mostly for

343
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:05,399
um

344
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:07,859
most of our experience not so much for

345
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,480
medical and but there are new

346
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,240
regulations in California we're going to

347
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:15,240
talk about that too that regulates the

348
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,339
chirping now but yes chirps to me uh

349
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,339
they play a big role into the Cannabis

350
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:24,240
experience and they enhance the medical

351
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:26,820
effects big time thanks uh so we come to

352
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,579
to the next question which goes out to

353
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:31,800
all panelists in that case is that a

354
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:34,859
conflict between the patient's demand

355
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:38,699
and the regulatory when it comes to FDA

356
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:40,860
or or the German cannabis agency when it

357
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,980
comes to clean clinical studies on the

358
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:46,379
long term uh the the one the the one

359
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,360
side says we don't need to we cannot

360
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:51,059
have the terpenes or we we don't want

361
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,560
them because they they don't stabilize

362
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:54,419
the product and we have an unstable

363
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:57,778
product but on the other side we have

364
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:59,278
the patient's demand for herbs how how

365
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:01,139
can we solve that on the long range

366
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,720
Jonah

367
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:05,220
you know I think it's important to to

368
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,320
consider the difference of course

369
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,940
between recreational and medical and

370
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,519
when it's medical like here in Germany

371
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,019
typically what we're going to see is the

372
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,179
government's going to be overly cautious

373
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:18,120
when they're first introducing a new

374
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:20,879
product or a new market and they want to

375
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,039
be able to have predictive results and

376
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,019
so when you so that's even when it comes

377
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,939
to like diluting and things like that

378
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:29,159
that way they can identify you know

379
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,139
repeatable experience with the cus with

380
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:32,759
the patient from that site

381
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:35,940
and so I think the only way to be able

382
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:38,458
to handle that would be again where you

383
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,540
can kind of fractionize you know you can

384
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,578
either fractionize different camera

385
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:43,379
noise get exact percentages and then

386
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:45,059
even with terpenes now you can do that

387
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:47,939
and so I think it would have to be again

388
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:49,500
a very repeatable controlled process for

389
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,800
it to actually you know be acceptable

390
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:55,860
here you know medically from that site

391
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,179
Joe please well one of the key issues

392
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:01,139
here is

393
00:15:57,179 --> 00:16:03,599
um you know the fdas and not only the

394
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:07,139
regulatory bodies they want to be able

395
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,860
to show that uh the placebo effect is

396
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:13,680
real versus versus a placebo which is

397
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,180
nearly impossible to do because you're

398
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:16,559
talking about multiple hundreds of

399
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:18,659
different compounds within the

400
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,278
formulation so from a clinical

401
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:22,159
perspective or medical perspective

402
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:25,919
pharmaceutical perspective

403
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:27,480
those types of things are really have a

404
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:30,299
real big of a problem and if I'm going

405
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,800
to spend 52 say 50 million dollars to

406
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:34,019
get a drug through I'm not going to

407
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:35,759
start with a product that has you know

408
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:37,740
something in it that's going to degrade

409
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,360
because it's too costly when the FDA

410
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,940
says at the end of it that that's no

411
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,579
good because it's degrading so and then

412
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,500
also the claims themselves what would be

413
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:48,899
the end point would be the key question

414
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,240
in in a clinical study and that would be

415
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:54,179
like okay uh okay so this this

416
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:57,600
particular terpene has a 10x effect with

417
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:59,399
with a ratio of say THC or CBD okay well

418
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,220
then you have to prove that and versus

419
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,958
placebo so that that from a medical and

420
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:07,019
pharmaceutical perspective that's really

421
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:10,198
the the key barrier because the even the

422
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:12,240
real world data is uh is very convoluted

423
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:15,419
it's not very very easy to come up with

424
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,699
a real world data that says hey this is

425
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:19,860
actually working so one of the one of

426
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:22,500
the great things about the recreational

427
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:26,458
Market is that you can get clinical real

428
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:29,039
world data from that as for efficacy

429
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:30,960
um if if those companies actually

430
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,659
designed their studies to get that data

431
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,880
they could really do a lot better with

432
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,919
their clinical studies

433
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,740
thank you

434
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,679
Nick let me ask a little bit provocative

435
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:46,019
or provoke to provoke you a little okay

436
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,600
what do you think it would be better to

437
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:51,480
have two kinds of extracts one without

438
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:54,359
anything pure cannibal needs just for

439
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,460
the medical side and another one for the

440
00:17:54,359 --> 00:18:00,678
recreational site containing all the

441
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:03,798
terpenes and other

442
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:06,120
ingredients which are not in the medical

443
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:08,400
what do you mean exactly like to have

444
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:11,759
two different products one two different

445
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,580
for to have the medical Pro product

446
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:16,440
terpene free so it's a stable product

447
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:18,960
and to have the recreational product

448
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,600
like full of terpenes yeah like like

449
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,880
full spectrum but to leave the uh to

450
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:26,159
leave it out of the medical product not

451
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,020
to have conflicts so to speak with the

452
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,419
regulatory site

453
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:32,759
yeah we can discuss about this it's a

454
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:33,600
matter of Regulation as we all discussed

455
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:36,240
before

456
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,038
so if they allow this to happen and we

457
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,740
can have these products in the

458
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:43,440
creational OR adult Market within Europe

459
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:46,798
it will be a good scenario for the

460
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,179
market and for the patients or users of

461
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:49,500
these products

462
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:52,200
when we're talking about medical

463
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,480
products as we all discussed you need to

464
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,179
be very specific and to have specific

465
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,140
formulation repeatable and tested and

466
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,240
proven

467
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,100
and to have the reasons of why this

468
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,240
formulation is there for what

469
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:06,599
application

470
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,700
so yes of course I would like to see the

471
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:10,459
these products to be available in the

472
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,200
European market in any way possible

473
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:16,620
would that be a solution for the U.S

474
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,660
market top free extracts for patients

475
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:21,659
George

476
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,940
well everybody knows what Indica is

477
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:27,179
sativa is and hybrid is it's all

478
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:31,140
disturbs the chips make a cannabis oil

479
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:35,519
Indica sativa or hybrid we know that in

480
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:37,080
marijuana usually 95 is the THC there

481
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,298
are a minor cannabinoids but there are

482
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:42,058
less than 10 less than five percent

483
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:44,038
so everything else that defines the the

484
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:46,200
medicinal values of the extract or how

485
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:48,839
it works to the human being is based on

486
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:52,080
the tubing profile I

487
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:54,720
would say maybe for certain patients

488
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,819
that they have a cancer conditions here

489
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,440
use the distillate or something combined

490
00:19:56,819 --> 00:20:01,678
with Direct cannabinoids in a certain

491
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:04,080
recipe literally a recipe like CBD to

492
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,900
THC one in one with five percent CBG is

493
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:09,178
a plural recipe for cancer it's from

494
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:12,720
some medical institutions and the

495
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:14,880
reports based on that but for the

496
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,240
general consumer they're going to be

497
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,820
looking for the properties under the

498
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,579
original strains

499
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:26,759
yeah one of the issues there is just

500
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:29,639
simply once it becomes a drug like CBD

501
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:32,819
became a drug in the United States all

502
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,160
of the formulations essentially by the

503
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:37,619
Regulatory Agencies became it became

504
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,538
adulterated products and that's why

505
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:42,058
they've been even though they've been on

506
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:43,679
the market uh they're basically not

507
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:44,879
allowed to advertise they're not allowed

508
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,100
to have banking they're not allowed to

509
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,020
have all these things that are that a

510
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:51,119
normal company would have the same thing

511
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:53,700
is going to happen with THC in the

512
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:58,319
United States and I think that that will

513
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:59,640
have a global impact also so I I it

514
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:02,279
would be really great if there was such

515
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,140
a thing as like a recreational a tasty

516
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:06,599
version which there has to be there's

517
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:09,000
going to be no matter what we do from a

518
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:11,519
clinical standpoint but I think that the

519
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:16,980
FDA is going to try to you know squash

520
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:19,200
at least in the U.S the competition yep

521
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,200
um what's the role of the FDA in General

522
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:26,038
Life Trust uh what's the role of the FDA

523
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,558
in general because as a German I think

524
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:30,359
it's federally illegal so the FDA

525
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,220
doesn't have to do anything with it but

526
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:33,899
it's all like this is it

527
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,900
yeah I mean essentially the role of the

528
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:39,240
FDA is to ensure safety you know for our

529
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,919
consumers in the U.S but where it can be

530
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,859
frustrating of course is you know

531
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,600
they've been talking about having CBD be

532
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:46,918
um essentially approved by the FDA for

533
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,500
they people thought it'd be three four

534
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,740
five years ago and it still hasn't

535
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,740
happened

536
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,600
oh okay yes from a pharmaceutical side

537
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,460
you're correct but from what people are

538
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,319
talking about as far as being able to

539
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,000
put it in food products and Beverages

540
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:04,798
and things like that like a lot of

541
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,380
people in the U.S expected it to happen

542
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,940
by now and it hasn't which you know

543
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,320
costs a lot of companies to then you

544
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,519
know go out of business from that site

545
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:14,158
because they're expecting for that to

546
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:15,900
happen by now and so but you know so

547
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,760
until the government's actually put the

548
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,620
right budget behind things to do the

549
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,419
studies that they say they're going to

550
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:25,219
do you know things are just going to be

551
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:25,220
continuing limbo you know from that side

552
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,259
because it's a drug they're not allowed

553
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:34,520
to do that without it being adulterated

554
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:36,960
so the the fact that epidiolex is there

555
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:40,079
basically makes all that all that

556
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,919
development impossible without going

557
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:43,918
through the FDA process

558
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:51,058
uh compared to

559
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:53,599
overseas in Germany we have very little

560
00:22:51,058 --> 00:22:56,460
use of users of extract

561
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:59,879
my guess is I don't have the numbers

562
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:02,340
here but my guess is we have less than

563
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,520
five percent of medical users or even

564
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:08,038
recreational users using extracts what

565
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:11,099
are the numbers in the U.S

566
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:12,839
judge about you you work in a lot of

567
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:14,879
States how

568
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:17,939
compared to butts what's the pressure

569
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:21,299
how many people's consume liquids or a

570
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:24,298
consumer extracts so United States most

571
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:26,220
of the users were medical a few years

572
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:28,038
ago now most of these are recreational

573
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,319
so with that change

574
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:33,298
we're looking at industry growing as a

575
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:34,558
gourmet industry we're really literally

576
00:23:33,298 --> 00:23:36,240
cooking for our customers we're

577
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,158
preparing the best experience for them

578
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,339
and

579
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:44,400
um with that said I see in the last

580
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:48,119
years vaping is going uh crazy vaping

581
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:51,659
and eatables versus the flour

582
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:54,719
would you agree that the fastest growing

583
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:58,860
sector within the Cannabis industry

584
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:02,279
Jonah yeah no 100 and we saw that a lot

585
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:04,619
in Oregon to where initially like early

586
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:07,558
on it was like 15 16 I think it was

587
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:10,439
probably about 70 80 flower cells but

588
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:12,359
now it's I think by 60 70 percent more

589
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,298
oil is what you'll see because the oil

590
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:16,740
is the Catalyst for all the other

591
00:24:15,298 --> 00:24:18,480
products it's not just the vape pens

592
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,179
it's the Edibles it's the tinctures it's

593
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,099
the creams the lotions topicals and so

594
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:25,679
yeah it significantly surpassed flower

595
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:27,480
and we start to see that in all the new

596
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,340
states that come online as well too it's

597
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,980
pretty predictable

598
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:34,379
Nick what do you think is the future of

599
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:37,200
extraction in Europe do you think we

600
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,760
will reach the U.S level soon or how do

601
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,819
you see the future of extractions in

602
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:44,038
Europe yeah hopefully it will get bigger

603
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:46,678
it has to get bigger I think extracts

604
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:48,720
are more suited for the pharmacies

605
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:50,400
in the way they're working in their

606
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,558
applications the final products that

607
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,798
will be available I think they're gonna

608
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:58,139
see more delivery methods targeting

609
00:24:55,798 --> 00:25:02,220
specific treatments like different like

610
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:05,220
maybe inhalers of mixed inhalers nasal

611
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:07,620
sprays this type of final products

612
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,919
and yeah hopefully we're gonna see more

613
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:09,918
of that

614
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:18,058
um George

615
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:20,519
you work in several U.S states

616
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:23,399
it's the regulation all the same there

617
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:25,319
or do you have to like okay this this

618
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:28,200
cultural Colorado this counts for

619
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:30,000
California or is that is that a big gap

620
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,740
or uh

621
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,480
what are regulations of course they're

622
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:37,099
different but they're different in a way

623
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:39,480
of Taxation and on the way of Licensing

624
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:41,339
everything else seems to be like The

625
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,259
Branding is allowed like if you have a

626
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:46,798
brand in one state that can propagate to

627
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:48,419
all the states that are legal which

628
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:54,619
pretty much provides same quality of

629
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:54,620
extract everywhere but again every state

630
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:58,558
has a different policy and Taxation and

631
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:00,120
Licensing which is the biggest

632
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:03,119
difference

633
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:04,558
you know uh in the United States uh

634
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,678
certainly

635
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:10,079
um basically the FDA has just issued

636
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,480
eight DEA licenses

637
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:16,139
um that's the first federally federally

638
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,679
allowed licenses for the production of

639
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:21,299
um for the production basically of drugs

640
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:23,759
and I think that that is going to

641
00:26:21,298 --> 00:26:26,759
eclipse the multi-state operator model

642
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:29,099
uh within five years

643
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:31,079
um simply because once those drugs get

644
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:33,298
through the FDA then the FDA will have

645
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:35,158
action against the states and we'll kind

646
00:26:33,298 --> 00:26:37,619
of see them Flex their muscles on that I

647
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:40,380
I think that that's what's coming so

648
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:42,899
again the federally the the federal

649
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:46,559
illegal stuff that's happening in the

650
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:48,840
states is is is probably on its last

651
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,700
legs I think in the next five years I

652
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:54,000
think uh definitely we're going to have

653
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,860
the FDA running the show and that's the

654
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,179
way it's been in the United States I

655
00:26:55,859 --> 00:27:00,178
think it's going to continue to be that

656
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:03,298
way uh with with these drugs which makes

657
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:05,519
be comfortable by final question I think

658
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:07,619
this step is the most important I will

659
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,200
give the Cannabis industry a very very

660
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:13,019
big push when the when it's the it's

661
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,400
medical legal Federal in the U.S do you

662
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:15,480
think this will still happen on the

663
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,460
Biden

664
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,740
uh yeah it looks like it's going to be

665
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:22,980
rescheduled sometime in September or

666
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:25,319
November or September based on we work

667
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,778
with five of the eight uh licensees

668
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:29,399
right now and uh we've worked with the

669
00:27:27,778 --> 00:27:31,259
DEA which is the Drug Enforcement

670
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,940
Administration directly so yeah that's

671
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:34,379
going to happen and that will have a

672
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:38,179
ripple effect around the world for sure

673
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,179
would you agree it's again James

674
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:43,679
it's federally illegal as a medicine

675
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:47,158
I wish I don't know that's uh that

676
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:49,919
protest never really happened we've been

677
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:52,919
talking about in the last two years

678
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:55,080
um but I see that really the the biggest

679
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:59,038
problem is yes FDA is going to need to

680
00:27:55,079 --> 00:28:01,139
take a call on the doses because they

681
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:03,740
need to issue proper doses for

682
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:06,360
everything uh for different ages I guess

683
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:08,880
there are different Kickbacks in every

684
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:11,579
state how do we Market how do we license

685
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,440
how do we do all those details now in

686
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:14,939
California like two weeks ago they shoot

687
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,500
another

688
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,220
um

689
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,619
um

690
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:22,278
another limitation you cannot even you

691
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:26,298
cannot Market

692
00:28:22,278 --> 00:28:29,339
strains and products with uh

693
00:28:26,298 --> 00:28:32,158
kids attractive names like candies like

694
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:33,839
uh you know all these things they're

695
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,039
going to be a lot of limit when that

696
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,019
gets

697
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:38,519
um Fairly Legal they're going to be a

698
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:40,859
lot of limitations I don't know if

699
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:42,298
they're ready to do that in this fall if

700
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:44,099
they're ready

701
00:28:42,298 --> 00:28:45,900
um they're probably gonna do it

702
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:47,939
thank you very much my last question

703
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,380
goes to Nick and Nick we don't hear so

704
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:52,019
much for Greece we hear a lot about

705
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:54,840
Europe Europe but from Greece on federal

706
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:57,359
level uh do you think they will ease up

707
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:59,579
a cannabis loss also for medical uh

708
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:02,158
cannabis in Greece soon we already have

709
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:04,740
a framework that has been around for

710
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:08,340
five years but you don't have so many

711
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:11,400
patients we have zero patients I know so

712
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:13,139
yeah we are preparing the framework we

713
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,360
are preparing the way these products are

714
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,860
gonna enter the Greek pharmacies there

715
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,139
is being some moves from some big

716
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:20,759
players on how this will happen in

717
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,500
combination with the

718
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:25,140
how it's called the pharmaceutical the

719
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,819
classic pharmaceutical companies that

720
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:30,299
deliver these products

721
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:33,058
and of course the main question is when

722
00:29:30,298 --> 00:29:35,038
and how many and how easy it will become

723
00:29:33,058 --> 00:29:36,538
to become a patient and to actually have

724
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:39,179
access to this product which I think

725
00:29:36,538 --> 00:29:40,798
this goes not only for Greece but it

726
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:43,140
goes for all Europe and maybe the

727
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:45,658
previous questions that you asked about

728
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:48,179
FDA hopefully what you say is going to

729
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:50,039
happen in September and I think this

730
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:53,038
will allow Europe will allow maybe

731
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:57,538
Germany to move a bit faster and without

732
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:59,278
being afraid of FDA and then if Germany

733
00:29:57,538 --> 00:30:01,740
moves forward then I think the rest of

734
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,898
the Europe will follow that so I see it

735
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:06,778
a little bit like Europe is waiting for

736
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:08,939
FDA Germany is waiting for that and the

737
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:11,398
rest of Europe is waiting for Germany

738
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:13,679
thank you very much and I also think the

739
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:16,918
FDA move would be a game changer also

740
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:19,980
for Germany because uh also money trans

741
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:21,720
money transactions will be legal on

742
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:24,179
International level and this will be if

743
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:28,519
the can chamber thank you very much of

744
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:28,519
to all panelists or the experts

745
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:34,220
thank you again Michael
