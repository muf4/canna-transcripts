00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,879
give it up for berinda

2
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:06,879
[Applause]

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,798
bu all right good morning the morning

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,638
after the Afterparty um so so wonderful

5
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:18,039
to see you it's uh an honor to be here

6
00:00:15,638 --> 00:00:20,960
today to see so many familiar faces meet

7
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:23,199
new people uh it's been amazing

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,519
conversations and debates and looking

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,359
forward to the interactions today uh as

10
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:28,678
mentioned uh my name is Bender berer I

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,080
serve as senior vice president of

12
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:32,640
corporate affairs with brains biole and

13
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:35,558
today we'll talk about advancing the

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,120
cannaboid scientific landscape but first

15
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:40,119
uh I want to tell you that when

16
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,959
presenting um I was researching evidence

17
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:44,280
and and what's key and and all of the

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,799
evidence that points to when making

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,640
presentations says that if you can

20
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,238
incorporate children and kids you get a

21
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,600
more captive audience so I want you to

22
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:56,320
meet my younger son anic uh he just had

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,960
his first hockey game two weeks ago he

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,359
was very happy uh anic my native

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,159
language is Punjabi and anik in Punjabi

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,680
means honor dignity and pride um but

27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,000
there's even more compelling evidence

28
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,680
that if you can incorporate pets somehow

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,680
you get even a more captive audience and

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,920
with AI look what we can produce these

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,720
days so now that I hopefully have your

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,280
attention we can get into the talk um

33
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,798
but today uh uh we're going to talk

34
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,079
about advancing the can uh cannaboid

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,520
scientific landscape I'll talk about how

36
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:31,000
using the right molecules we can uh

37
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:33,719
Advance clinical trials we we can do a

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,519
lot of great Innovations we can um do a

39
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,640
lot of great formulations we can attract

40
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,798
the neutraceutical and pharmaceutical

41
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,280
Industries to be Champions uh uh in in

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,880
creating um Therapeutics and therapies

43
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,040
that are need for million needed for

44
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,640
Millions around the world all of that

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,640
with the goal of providing solutions to

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,640
patients loved ones and friends now I'll

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,319
also say that we know there's a lot of

48
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,478
Pathways to providing therapies um

49
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:01,959
there's uh uh the medical pathway

50
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:05,039
there's a a pharmaceutical pathway

51
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:08,159
there's full spectrum broadspectrum you

52
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:10,318
know using Turpin but uh that is all

53
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,400
part of the solutions and this is the

54
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,359
approach we have taken to focus on

55
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,439
cannaboids because we are utilizing all

56
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,879
of our executive teams experience within

57
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:22,919
the pharmaceutical space so we are a

58
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:26,518
part of that solution of that full gamut

59
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:27,958
that we'll bring uh to to you here um

60
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll give you a quick little background

61
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,840
on who we are at brains bi we're a

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,840
evidence-based science side Pioneer of

63
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,640
cannaboid Health and Wellness Solutions

64
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,080
our business could be summarized into uh

65
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,158
four verticals namely we provide active

66
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,680
pharmaceutical ingredients to the

67
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:48,439
pharmaceutical Industries we uh have

68
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,319
applications and enhanced Delivery

69
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:53,158
Systems we also uh are into

70
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:56,958
pharmaceutical development where we

71
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:59,519
create new chemical entities uh for high

72
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,239
and unmet needs of pioneering the

73
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,280
scientist cific landscape and working

74
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:06,920
with uh researchers around the globe and

75
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,878
we take all of our foundational work on

76
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:10,719
the API side that we produce and we

77
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:14,039
bring neutraceutical and dietary

78
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:16,199
supplement products with pure High CBD

79
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:18,439
uh providing finished dosage forms all

80
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:21,479
of them that come with certifications

81
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:25,039
such as NSF uh novel Foods validated

82
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:27,518
both in the EU and also the UK tested by

83
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:30,840
the world anti-doping agency laboratory

84
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,519
and also informed choice and then uh

85
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,519
lastly we we are pioneering and uh

86
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,239
pioneering novel uh evidences and

87
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:39,680
support products for the animal health

88
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,719
side so everything that we do on The

89
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,200
Human Side we bring to the Animal Health

90
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:48,400
side now why do we do this and what

91
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:52,280
excites all of us to to do this it's

92
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:55,480
because it's not just us as uh industry

93
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,239
Executives it's not just us as uh sector

94
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:59,479
folks talking about the excitement

95
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,560
what's happening but it's the scientists

96
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:03,878
it's it's the researchers it's the

97
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,640
medical community it's the doctors that

98
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:07,318
want to see the evidence and data what

99
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:09,000
can do and we know what the evidence

100
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:11,318
says that companies that can

101
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,519
successfully modify the endocannabinoid

102
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:16,478
system and understand how the different

103
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,759
cannaboids work within uh work within

104
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:22,599
the body can unlock powerful potential

105
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,199
Therapeutics and so it's not just as I

106
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,520
mentioned us saying that and you look at

107
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,160
the potential you look at the quotes on

108
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,918
the screen coming from eminent

109
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,800
researchers this is why it's so

110
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:33,279
important with the right team and the

111
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,038
right Focus we can unlock a lot of

112
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,359
positive therapies out there but it

113
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:39,879
doesn't come without challenges there

114
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,800
are a lot of challenges and and one of

115
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:45,000
the challenges uh that we see is a

116
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,918
patient challenge there are outliers uh

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,720
places like right here in Germany places

118
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:53,000
in North America where um patients do

119
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,280
have access but let's use the UK as an

120
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,038
example right now currently today there

121
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:03,159
are two to three million people that can

122
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:05,519
that that could rely on cannaboid based

123
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,439
therapies 2 to three million people yet

124
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:12,120
only 25,000 are getting access it's

125
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:14,439
about less than 1% and out of the

126
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,720
124,000 general practitioners that could

127
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:20,199
be prescribing 400 are trained to

128
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,560
prescribe but yet only about 110 of

129
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,960
those are prescribing again less than 1%

130
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,680
and it's not the solution we need the

131
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:31,239
medical community doctors to become

132
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,759
champions of this industry to provide

133
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,720
Solutions now one of the challenges also

134
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,479
is is is for the doctors is that there's

135
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,280
only been two to three fully Market

136
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:43,519
authorized uh drugs available and if you

137
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,839
look at the time that the time Gap in

138
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:49,439
between uh you look at danabol approved

139
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:52,318
in 1985 for nausea and vomiting it's

140
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,959
almost 40 years ago and then in 1992 for

141
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:58,600
weight loss and HIV patients uh we had

142
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:02,120
epida in 2018 for two rare conditions

143
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:05,000
and saapa still waiting approval in in a

144
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,800
lot of uh jurisdictions so this is why

145
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,959
we need to ensure we get the

146
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,079
pharmaceutical industry excited to

147
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,038
become Champions and how do we how do we

148
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:15,279
excite them how do we get them involved

149
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:19,120
well pharma's going to get excited when

150
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:21,279
we can create uh new novel chemes new

151
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,199
chemical entities when the drug that

152
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,799
we're producing is novel when there's

153
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,439
sufficient data to support Market

154
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,639
authorization and when we have the

155
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:32,800
confidence that patients will be re

156
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,960
first and that uh uh and that your

157
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,079
product's going to be commercially

158
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:39,560
viable and lastly you need to ensure

159
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:41,279
that we have key opinion leaders that

160
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,000
are going to go out there and endorse

161
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:46,799
and become champions of your product now

162
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,598
your clinical program also has to be

163
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,280
robust now clinical programs can take up

164
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:54,279
to a decade and cost a billion dollars

165
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:56,119
but you've got to ensure to get Market

166
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:57,198
off and you got to realize too though

167
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,160
when you're going through a clinical

168
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,840
program by the time you finished your

169
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,560
drug probably going to be genericized so

170
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,560
you got to show significant improvement

171
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,720
over the current standard of care to

172
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,800
ensure that you can get premium pricing

173
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,599
and recoup your benefits so what is the

174
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,240
solution now what is the pathway for us

175
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:20,360
to get there it's not easy it takes time

176
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,280
and I will emphasize there are no

177
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,280
shortcuts I think there is a lot of

178
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:26,878
myths and a lot of false assumptions

179
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:28,519
within the industry at large early on

180
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,720
but just because that we're dealing with

181
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:33,799
a natural plant Bas substance that

182
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,639
Regulators around the world will provide

183
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,560
fast

184
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,478
tracks if we want to bring cannaboid

185
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:43,720
based drugs pharmaceutical drugs there

186
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:46,079
are no shortcuts we have to follow the

187
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,879
established biotech and Pharma

188
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:52,120
regulatory Pathways that are enshrined

189
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:55,319
in law there are no shortcuts but you

190
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,759
can get there and we know uh by

191
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:00,598
introducing new chemical entities with

192
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,680
strong patents and demonstrating uh uh

193
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:03,560
care that's going to be above the

194
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,840
current standard we can get there

195
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,240
there's a lot of anecdotal evidence out

196
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,439
there there's a lot of proof of concept

197
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,519
studies out there there's a lot of

198
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:12,839
observational studies but a lot of them

199
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:15,079
don't have patents or limited patents

200
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,638
that are there and gen generally I would

201
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:19,800
say cannaboid studies need to follow the

202
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,439
accepted regulatory Pathways with

203
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,879
minimum thresholds that exist out there

204
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,639
and that includes having two randomized

205
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:29,158
double blind controlled studies that

206
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:32,080
showcase your efficacy and your safety

207
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:34,319
um and again to uh to emphasize there

208
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,759
are no shortcuts it's enshrined in law

209
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,200
it's regulated if we want to follow the

210
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:42,000
process we can bring these Therapeutics

211
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,519
out there it is complicated it does take

212
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,839
time um but for us to to get there the

213
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,519
pathway you have to follow you got to

214
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,600
ensure that we understand the phac uh pH

215
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,759
pharmacology behind it understand the

216
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,920
biology understand how the receptors are

217
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:58,039
binding understanding the uh ascending

218
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,599
and descending sequencing understanding

219
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:03,759
our dosing in in PK all of that put

220
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,399
through a phase 1 2 3 and keep in mind

221
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,200
not everything makes it to a phase three

222
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:10,600
not everything makes it to a phase two

223
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,800
get there so what are some of the um uh

224
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,240
areas that uh that could assist to to

225
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,919
attract PHA you heard me talk about

226
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,720
patents and and you want if we want them

227
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:21,639
to be Champions we got to have patents

228
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,278
along with our new uh new chemical

229
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:26,319
entities and what we're looking for is

230
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:28,759
comp uh is composition of matter patents

231
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,160
where you can get about 20 gears now in

232
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:32,838
order to have a drug patentable what do

233
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:35,439
we need and what are we looking for it's

234
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,959
got to be novel you got to have utility

235
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,079
you got to show that it's better than

236
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,119
what's currently being used out there

237
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:43,319
it's got to be non-obvious and there has

238
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,078
to be evidence to support that it works

239
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,120
you got to have a clear description of

240
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:48,239
how it works which means you got to

241
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,159
understand how the receptors are going

242
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,079
to bind you got to understand the

243
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:55,759
pathways and its impact got to do all

244
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:57,919
the investigational pharmacology biology

245
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:00,958
and then it gets approved without

246
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:04,039
shortcuts but there are ways we can do

247
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:06,799
things more efficiently uh and and FASTT

248
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:09,039
tracking and then also drisk some of the

249
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:11,359
Investments that are that are going in

250
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,559
you could look at doing inv vitro and

251
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,278
invivo studies over human which

252
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:18,679
relatively a lot less cheaper and by

253
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,240
doing in vitro where you're looking at

254
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:22,958
the cell Wells and how The receptors uh

255
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,879
uh will bond to it you can determine if

256
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:28,039
it's toxic you can determine the drug

257
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:31,000
interactions relatively cheap now

258
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:33,599
there's a saying in the industry kill

259
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,759
early kill cheaply if you're not getting

260
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,519
the indications that you're going kill

261
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:41,360
it and go look for a new lead um don't

262
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,078
plog a dead horse and if you're not

263
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,560
getting the signals Move Along also you

264
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,919
can look at your animal models and you

265
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:49,759
could look at uh developing a robust

266
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,759
invivo program you look at your drug

267
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,319
interactions there you look at if it's

268
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,879
toxic or not you could have a drug

269
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,360
that's so effective but if it's going to

270
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:00,919
be toxic it's not going to get approved

271
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,519
again kill early kill cheap don't spend

272
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:05,719
5 years uh or or Lifetime on something

273
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,600
that you know it's not going to get uh

274
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:11,000
approved the other thing we need to do

275
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,839
is start with the end in mind and it is

276
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,600
so critical to understand your target

277
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,040
market profile and your target product

278
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,399
profile how are you going to

279
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:22,519
differentiate your product your drug

280
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,078
amongst the competition that's out there

281
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,039
and how is it going to be above the

282
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,319
current standard of care and these are

283
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,919
all components that we need to use to

284
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,879
develop the regulary pathway um what are

285
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:35,000
your therapeutic areas for your target

286
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,639
market profile what are the Target

287
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,879
patient profiles what are the patient

288
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:42,079
characteristics looking at the Target uh

289
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:43,759
product profile when you look at the age

290
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,439
of the patient the source of clinical

291
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,439
differentiator all of this involved

292
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,760
moving forward with having the end in

293
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,959
mind and the target market profile helps

294
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:53,958
you get there move

295
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,360
along now all of this is challenging it

296
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,759
takes time it takes people but done

297
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,240
right with the right team and the right

298
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:06,519
people there are rewards if we look at

299
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,480
epids right now approaching a billion

300
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:11,560
dollars and in 2022 grew

301
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,399
16% I think the Pharma industry in

302
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:17,638
general is growing at about 4% uh davol

303
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:20,720
despite having generics out there at

304
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:22,198
it's growing it's at about 400 million

305
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,720
and we still don't know the full effects

306
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:25,679
of s effects because it's not fully

307
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,040
approved in in all

308
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,759
jurisdictions leaders need to leave and

309
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:31,639
leave people in better places

310
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,919
then they found them and there is a

311
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:36,000
pathway there uh there is ways to get

312
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,479
there and ultimately we need to ensure

313
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,639
we follow that pathway to bring the

314
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,079
therapeutic benefits to the millions

315
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:45,039
that uh that need these um uh

316
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:47,359
products we talked about the challenge

317
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,399
is we talked about there how can we get

318
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,039
there um I'll give you some examples of

319
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:54,240
of what we're doing at brain bial uh

320
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:56,519
with our partners and how we're walking

321
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,440
this path and trying to be courageous to

322
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,839
to do full clinical programming finish

323
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,440
dosage form products and what we're

324
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,399
doing on Innovations so we can bring uh

325
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,519
uh pharmaceutical drugs to the market

326
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:11,078
now for us our our drug development

327
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,560
program started off by uh us getting

328
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:14,159
involved in in clinical studies

329
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,638
supplying our active pharmaceutical

330
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,120
ingredients to over clinical 30

331
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,278
pre-clinical and clinical studies

332
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,639
globally of which we supporting a phase

333
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:25,639
three and then we moved on to our own

334
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,959
inhuman studies where um we're working

335
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:30,198
with researchers around the globe

336
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:32,679
researchers such as siai that are using

337
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:35,120
our specially designed and formulated

338
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:37,919
capsules on a phase 2 study for opium

339
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,839
harm reduction now I I was born and

340
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:44,759
raised in Vancouver Canada um in North

341
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:48,839
America in Canada and the US

342
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:50,039
alone every day we're losing 150 people

343
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:54,320
to opiate

344
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:56,439
overdose it's 150 deaths daily and this

345
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,560
is why it's so critical for us to be

346
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,920
champions of potential therapies and I

347
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,719
say potential cuz we're still going

348
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:04,078
through a clinical trial we're not there

349
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,240
yet but as a way as a mechanism to help

350
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:09,039
support and help save lives and help

351
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,159
people around there um and now we we

352
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:14,639
moved on to our own drug drug Discovery

353
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:17,719
where we are developing our uh new

354
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,440
chemical entities focusing on neurology

355
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,040
and we will lead our own pre-clinical

356
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,519
and clinical studies in those areas and

357
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:27,039
our objectives are simple we want to

358
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:29,759
improve the efficacy of cannaboids we

359
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:32,439
want to prove the spe specific

360
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,600
and targets for research and we want to

361
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,160
have efficient drug delivery

362
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,240
formulations and we want to do this all

363
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:41,159
in partnership with World leading

364
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,440
Partnerships uh with innovators and

365
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:46,958
collaborator collaborators around the

366
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,639
world now what does the future hold and

367
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:52,758
what guides us towards the future what

368
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:54,320
we've done is we've taken our CBD API uh

369
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:57,199
which is an industry standard we've

370
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,040
produced over 500 consistent batches uh

371
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:01,639
supplied it and over 30 clinical trials

372
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,719
files globally we've backed that up with

373
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:05,560
uh technical packages which includes a

374
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,079
US drug Master file which has been

375
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:10,879
referenced also includes includes a Au

376
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:13,719
active substance Master file and a drug

377
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:16,958
substance impd we take that work what we

378
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,278
did on the CBD side and we we are now um

379
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:21,479
developing other cannaboids as active

380
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:24,000
pharmaceutical ingredients to provide

381
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,800
more options for research more solutions

382
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,639
out there now very proud to say we have

383
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,278
uh THC Delta 9 in a solid form available

384
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,879
for clinical research now as an active

385
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:36,480
pharmaceutical ingredient we have CBN

386
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:38,958
and CBG also available and we've taken

387
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,120
that foundation on the active side and

388
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,838
we have isolated neutraceutical products

389
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,480
for both human and animal use available

390
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,319
and that's exciting we can take

391
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,319
potential collaborations with beverages

392
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:51,719
we can look at animal health we can look

393
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:53,879
at how athletes are looking at recovery

394
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,839
inflammation and pain work with sports

395
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:57,399
Sciences Sports Nutrition on on the

396
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,199
neutraceutical side

397
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:02,480
too and we believe all of this happens

398
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:05,078
through partnership and you can't do

399
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,399
Innovation uh on your own and we're very

400
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:09,758
proud to uh be here today with DSM for

401
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:12,559
Minish uh we're very proud partners with

402
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:15,159
them and together brains bio and DSM for

403
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:16,719
Minish we provide endtoend Solutions

404
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:19,439
right from your active pharmaceutical

405
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,278
ingredients to clinical trials to finish

406
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,880
dosage forms but one of the key areas on

407
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:27,198
Innovation that we are working with uh

408
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,919
and DSM is DSM firman taking a lead on

409
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:32,120
this is is in forign areas too that's

410
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:34,639
that's so critically important one is

411
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,679
enhancing the bio sorry enhancing

412
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,720
stability where um we know that

413
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,599
stability is Paramount to the success of

414
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,399
and active ingredient so how are we

415
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,480
going to enhance solutions for enhanced

416
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,399
stability enhancing the solubility where

417
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,720
DSM fir Minish has developed proprietary

418
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,839
powder cat Technologies capable of

419
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,759
enhancing the solubility providing more

420
00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:00,560
options out there enhancing our

421
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,600
bioavailability how are we going to

422
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,918
provide lower dosage forms and provide

423
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,360
more options so by means of lipid

424
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:10,280
encapsulation nanoemulsification or

425
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:13,038
liposomal delivery and also and I think

426
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:15,000
this one's very key uh providing

427
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:17,919
targeted Delivery Solutions targeting

428
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
the delivery of active specific regions

429
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,720
particularly in the GI track and this is

430
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,400
something where DSM Firmin is leading

431
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,078
we're proud to support them on this

432
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,160
they're doing clinical data on and

433
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:31,200
studying all to provide Pat patient

434
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,160
Centric Solutions uh that can be

435
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,880
championed by our medical community by

436
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,880
the Pharma industry there so a real live

437
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,799
example recently uh I can give you of

438
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,760
that partnership and collaboration

439
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:46,798
that's taking place is we have OMG

440
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:49,798
Pharma also here from from Australia and

441
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:53,079
brains bio is an API and DSM for Anish

442
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:55,960
working with OMG have now developed Orly

443
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:57,439
dissolvable tablets for for insomnia

444
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,798
that's Innovation that's providing

445
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,120
Innovation solid or drug forms it's

446
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:04,000
providing more options and it's through

447
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:07,239
Partnerships that this is all going to

448
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,038
take place but the foundation of all of

449
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,599
this work uh for us comes

450
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:14,960
through uh comes through writing with

451
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,000
starting with the right

452
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,440
molecules starting with the right

453
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,919
molecules and the active ingredients can

454
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,159
assist your clinical program it can

455
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,640
assist in your Innovation it can assist

456
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:29,559
in different products it can assist in

457
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,759
providing patient Centric Solutions

458
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:33,839
that is the key and we've seen it time

459
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:36,158
and time again where uh folks have

460
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:38,480
started a clinical program only to come

461
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,880
to phase 2 three be compromised and have

462
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:45,599
to start again that's time and that's

463
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:48,240
money so um as you heard me say leaders

464
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:50,639
lead and leave people in a better place

465
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,279
than they found them leaders also uplift

466
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,600
leaders collaborate and leaders don't

467
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:57,158
leave people behind and as a father I

468
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:00,199
want to ensure I don't leave my older

469
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:02,240
son behind um this is my older son mava

470

work when I approach things when I

474
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:15,200
