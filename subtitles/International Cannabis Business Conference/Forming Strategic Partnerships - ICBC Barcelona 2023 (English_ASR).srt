81
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,519
um I have to tell you just uh well I'll

82
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,580
introduce myself I'm Jamie Pearson

83
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,700
um as ungayo said I'm a consultant I do

84
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,260
Global consultancy now I was the CEO of

85
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,259
bang for those of you who know bang

86
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:54,359
chocolate I did that job for three years

87
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:57,359
after seven years of being in the

88
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,060
company I left and people have been

89
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,400
asking me to help them bring their

90
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,819
companies to Europe and my specific

91
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,860
Target this trip was finding some of the

92
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:11,098
bigger players that were wanting to do

93
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,379
deals around 50 to 200 million dollars

94
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:15,238
like the big players that are going to

95
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:18,539
come conquer this Market I came to find

96
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:21,418
you so if you're out there come find me

97
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,000
um and I think the reason that I've been

98
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:27,719
successful in the Cannabis industry is

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,418
that I believe 100 that we are not

100
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,780
competitors we are colleagues and when

101
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:36,620
people know each other and they connect

102
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:39,719
their networks that's when magic happens

103
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,040
so I'd like to start by asking George

104
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,080
I'm going to just go in order because

105
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,699
it's easier I'm linear it's just kind of

106
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:45,659
how my brain works

107
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,960
um

108
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:52,080
could you name a time that you've

109
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:55,319
formed a partnership that was really

110
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,879
beneficial to your company and were

111
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:58,740
there challenges in getting that

112
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,000
partnership formed and if so how did you

113
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,000
overcome them

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,579
sure so just recently we we form a

115
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,660
partnership with Belushi Farms oh hang

116
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:08,819
on one second

117
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,639
okay that was a panelist I was about to

118
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:14,279
go off on somebody out there

119
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:17,340
you get a pass everybody shut off your

120
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:20,239
phones please okay start over but that's

121
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:23,099
passman why does he get a pass

122
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,780
it wasn't passed when it was Dr John but

123
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:28,740
you gave Dr John a pass but that's

124
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:30,679
password fair enough okay you said the

125
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,538
energetic you have to be entertaining

126
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,060
all the day everyone's dying so recently

127
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:39,000
we just did a a partnership with Belushi

128
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,759
Farms so Jim Belushi does a show on on

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,120
um Discovery called growing Belushi and

130
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,038
they're doing a a a cannabis Rescue in

131
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,379
Illinois

132
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:56,159
we met him in MJ bizcon in Las Vegas

133
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:59,159
they had a problem with uh with uh the

134
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:03,300
flower was very dirty they were not

135
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:05,939
passing aspergillus cfu

136
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:09,240
um and we we have the the equipment that

137
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:11,219
can fix that so we formed this

138
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,800
partnership with them we worked with

139
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,840
them the obstacles to overcome are

140
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,220
mainly regulations within the state of

141
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,079
Illinois

142
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,840
um you know working together with them

143
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,899
uh understanding what their scope was

144
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:27,959
when our scope was what we could offer

145
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:30,179
but the bottom line is together we

146
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:33,138
formed a union that's going to be able

147
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,879
to help this failing Farm in Illinois

148
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:37,139
and so there's 10 vendors in there so

149
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,620
there's a lighting vendor that's

150
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:42,960
actually here as well

151
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,939
yeah fos and a couple other vendors that

152
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,918
are helping them out they have the

153
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:49,740
nutrient one they have one for hydration

154
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:52,079
but this is a really good strategic

155
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,478
um uh partnership that we have with

156
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,399
these guys because not only are we

157
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,199
helping them but they're helping us as

158
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,538
far as the image of the of

159
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,759
decontamination in general well I can

160
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:04,978
imagine it's a bad deal when you're

161
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,139
Belushi's Farm you're high profile and

162
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:09,719
then you have someone say your flower is

163
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:11,819
dirty nobody wants to hear that that can

164
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,160
really harm a company and then you

165
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:15,900
provide a solution that's where a

166
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,300
strategic partnership was a win-win and

167
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:22,138
that's the other thing I think win-win

168
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,660
is the key because even if you could

169
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:28,139
um get a home run but you make sure the

170
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,060
other side has the win that's when the

171
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:33,840
Partnerships last forever

172
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,519
so Petra same question uh great

173
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,679
Partnerships

174
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,500
um that you could name and then if

175
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,300
there's been a part an obstacle

176
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:46,079
um you know or when you have to vet

177
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:48,660
somebody talk to us about that well

178
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:52,918
um we were lucky to find a really good

179
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:55,560
partner from Portugal cannoli canoli is

180
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:59,279
the name of the company and

181
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,680
um it's funny how in every business it's

182
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:05,579
hard to find a

183
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,819
partner that has the same

184
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:11,939
goals that you do the mentality oriented

185
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:15,240
in the similar business eventually it's

186
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:17,939
all about the money but when it comes to

187
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:21,780
that there are so many steps to get

188
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:26,098
there and sometimes gut feeling is the

189
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:30,598
thing that gets you going and I think

190
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:32,639
if we still listen to that I think that

191
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:33,500
we're safe there

192
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:38,098
um

193
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:42,059
it's really a challenge to to do this

194
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:45,300
especially in cannabis business I think

195
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:47,699
um because a lot of people come into

196
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:50,939
this just because okay cannabis who see

197
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:53,300
the benefits and the prices go and we

198
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:57,060
will earn a lot of money and so on

199
00:08:53,299 --> 00:09:01,259
and um there are a lot of people that

200
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:06,299
don't actually mean something

201
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:08,879
um but we we kind of got lucky and we're

202
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:11,759
really hoping to develop a really nice

203
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:15,000
strategic partnership with them and what

204
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:17,720
do they do exactly uh they do different

205
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,879
things they do medical cannabis

206
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,740
facilities now

207
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:25,080
but they have their connection and their

208
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,740
Distributors for

209
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,580
um

210
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,440
products that we make

211
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:33,540
so they make you make the product and

212
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,920
they distribute them in Europe yes and

213
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:38,039
how did you find them

214
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:41,939
actually they found me through ICBC

215
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:44,159
pitch that I had and on I was there for

216
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,560
that investment Global investment Forum

217
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:49,379
that I had uh three years ago I think it

218
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:53,278
was three years ago and

219
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:56,278
um we took a while it's I think every

220
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:59,519
partnership takes a while and you cannot

221
00:09:56,278 --> 00:10:03,539
do anything through the night but

222
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:06,480
um we were picky too so we didn't go for

223
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:08,399
the first one who came and I think it's

224
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,800
really important who you choose to

225
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:14,879
represent you and to represent your

226
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:17,599
products and if someone does that it's

227
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:20,458
important that it stands

228
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,320
that it has the same principles that you

229
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:24,838
do you have you have

230
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,000
for sure some people want speed to

231
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,860
Market some people want price protection

232
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,839
whatever it is you want you've got to

233
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,300
find the right partner and the

234
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,899
corporation is really important so the

235
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:38,759
communication we can adjust to a lot of

236
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,980
things and we can

237
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,838
um for example we can

238
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,500
um

239
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:49,740
have someone uh

240
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,899
say how it goes in the different markets

241
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,360
and so on but I think it's really

242
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:56,958
important too that we

243
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,519
um for me as a brand

244
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:01,159
Ambassador as a brand presentation

245
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,679
presenter

246
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:06,360
that I need to be involved also in those

247
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:08,819
kind of business with strategic

248
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,579
Partnerships because it's eventually

249
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,200
it's

250
00:11:10,578 --> 00:11:18,120
at the end of the day it's the brand

251
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:20,100
that sells so it must be important it's

252
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,820
really important who you choose and how

253
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,820
how they do it

254
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:29,458
Brian is a headhunter

255
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:31,319
and I'm thinking about

256
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:33,479
um when I was running bang and I was

257
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,360
using recruitment services to place

258
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,519
Executives naturally you're going to be

259
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,379
a strategic partner for me because I'm

260
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,839
going to tell you everything I need and

261
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:46,078
you got to go find that person

262
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:48,060
but I also found working with you that

263
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,099
partnership was different

264
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:53,338
because it was truly a partnership it

265
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:58,019
was not just here's the task go jump

266
00:11:53,339 --> 00:12:00,779
through the hoop so talk to me about how

267
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:02,820
headhunters for companies can be

268
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:06,539
strategic Partners in ways that people

269
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:09,240
in the audience maybe aren't aware of

270
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:11,219
sure yeah and I agree with everything

271
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,820
you said earlier about

272
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,060
um

273
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:17,040
Partnerships coming through uh building

274
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:20,039
relationships getting to know each other

275
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:23,159
which is I think how all of our

276
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:26,099
strategic Partnerships came about like

277
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:29,278
we knew each other socially really well

278
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,800
before we started working together and

279
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,958
I've got loads of great stories from

280
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:37,620
consuming weird stuff on mountaintops

281
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:39,838
with people that became clients to uh

282
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,240
stories Galore we have a

283
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,519
fun I think real quick on my strategic

284
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,500
partnership story because I have a I

285
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,240
have a fun one

286
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,700
um again the the guys that run the

287
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,200
Canadian Securities Exchange are pretty

288
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,500
fun to hang out with

289
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:58,320
and they approached us at a gathering in

290
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,240
Miami Beach a year or two ago and asked

291
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,820
if we would mind being listed on their

292
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,440
website as a search partner and I said

293
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,680
wow what's that going to cost I don't

294
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,060
know thanks a lot and they said no no we

295
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,679
know you you place a lot of the people

296
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:12,979
that a lot of our clients need you would

297
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:15,539
actually be doing us a favor

298
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,100
if we can just refer someone to you

299
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:18,778
instead of trying to help them hire

300
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,920
their Chief accounting officer whomever

301
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:22,799
they needed

302
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,778
so obviously a big win for us we got a

303
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,939
lot of business from that and in a funny

304
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:29,039
way a win for them because they didn't

305
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,540
have to try to be recruiters so now

306
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,659
everyone wants to try to be a recruiter

307
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:36,120
as their Hobby

308
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:39,659
so having a good uh recruiter as a

309
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:42,839
strategic partner rather than a vendor

310
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:45,539
is a benefit to our clients and

311
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,100
companies that use recruiters in a

312
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:48,360
similar partnership way because they're

313
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,700
your eyes and ears out there they're

314
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,220
talking everyone in the industry they're

315
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:56,040
driving business your way our clients

316
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,440
get referrals from us all of the time I

317
00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:00,599
I don't and I don't like to monetize

318
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,000
every introduction their success is our

319
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,920
success there's a reason my LinkedIn

320
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,740
pronoun is super connector I just love

321
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:09,838
making introductions and I think my

322
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,639
partner wishes I'd monetize more them

323
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,519
but I don't think I would have the

324
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:16,200
Goodwill that we have right this you

325
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,120
have to build up a lot of Goodwill

326
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,639
currency in your bank account in this

327
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,539
industry to keep the Partnerships huge

328
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,639
yeah it's huge yeah so uh yeah that's

329
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:28,559
that's all I have to say on that

330
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,100
okay so

331
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,679
um

332
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,600
I'm kind of a fan girl of Dr John he

333
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,620
doesn't know that but I just disclosed

334
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,980
it

335
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,480
um he's kind of a big deal it's it's

336
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,039
kind of funny

337
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,560
um he's doing a lot of pharmaceutical

338
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:46,500
work and I think that's going to be big

339
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:49,198
in Europe because I think where cannabis

340
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,480
in America in most of the states started

341
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:54,359
from medical cannabis

342
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,000
I think it's different though here where

343
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,539
the medical element of it really does

344
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,759
require eugmp

345
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:05,519
API you know actual pharmaceutical

346
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:08,519
ingredients have to be run through uh

347
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,159
pharmaceutical grade technology so my

348
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:13,459
question to you is you have these

349
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:15,899
companies in Europe and in the U.S that

350
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:18,059
are pharmaceutical companies that's what

351
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:20,458
you're working with right how do you how

352
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:24,119
do you help them get launched in

353
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:26,000
cannabis so we help them on many many

354
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,698
different levels and it's not just

355
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,578
products uh coming from us to them it is

356
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:36,179
or even services

357
00:15:31,578 --> 00:15:39,179
for example we might connect a grower in

358
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:44,419
one region under gacp with a GMP

359
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:48,059
producer in Europe or we might connect a

360
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:50,939
a U.S investor that that wants to get

361
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:54,359
into the eugmp world with a

362
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:56,000
pharmaceutical company and a and a and a

363
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,220
grower we've done all of those

364
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,440
connections and sometimes we're involved

365
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,060
in the transaction sometimes it's just a

366
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,860
you know hey here we know this guy

367
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:07,319
you're looking for this this other guy

368
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:10,440
it seems to work it's it's

369
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,420
um it's kind of a a nice way to do that

370
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,720
and it allows them to grow their

371
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:18,120
business and we we get the social cred

372
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:21,300
and we also get the business credit in

373
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,519
the in the in the process of that

374
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:26,278
um and one of the things that we've

375
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,139
really been work working on is making

376
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:30,958
sure that you know the products that we

377
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:33,419
have are are applicable and to the

378
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:37,258
pharmaceutical world and um one example

379
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:40,078
of of uh you know a very good JV that we

380
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:42,740
just went through recently is a company

381
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:46,078
where uh we're using our technology

382
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:48,720
which is basically CO2 and we're using

383
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:51,179
that to create water-soluble uh products

384
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,980
for formulations which we weren't in

385
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:55,078
before but it's just like one step away

386
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:58,259
from what we do and it's using our

387
00:16:55,078 --> 00:17:00,659
technology it was a Canadian company the

388
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:03,959
company is called isolate and rjv is

389
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:05,639
isolate USA JV and we're basically

390
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:08,058
providing them access to the market

391
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:11,160
access to Pharmaceuticals access to

392
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:13,859
Europe and European customers they're

393
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,179
actually operating in our facility

394
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:17,599
um and so it's been it's really great

395
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:20,759
and then they they brought they brought

396
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,918
you know tobacco companies to us and

397
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:24,419
with a bunch of tobacco money so it's

398
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,699
stuff that I never could have connected

399
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:30,179
myself but now we're creating all kinds

400
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:32,880
of apis based on uh you know nicotine

401
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:34,200
for example interesting right uh that

402
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,720
has nothing to do with cannabis but we

403
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,600
also do cannabis work and connecting

404
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,519
those people now with um with our

405
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:44,939
customers so

406
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:47,579
um I think that we we always look at

407
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,679
um you know JV Partners or a gent joint

408
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:52,558
venture partners with you know does it

409
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,820
fit strategically does it fulfill a need

410
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:59,160
in both of our portfolios

411
00:17:55,819 --> 00:18:00,599
and it can we work work together do we

412
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,940
like each other you know that type of

413
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:04,798
stuff all of that's important do you

414
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,120
like single malt scotch or not you know

415
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,519
that type of thing if you want to see

416
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:10,500
their name come across your phone or

417
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:13,379
you're not like oh it's that guy right

418
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,179
oh not him again oh yeah so I get to

419
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,100
talk to them yes it doesn't work with

420
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:19,259
the rest of the team too and do the

421
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:22,019
cultures really work well together

422
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:24,480
um you know we when we do JV work

423
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:26,460
um you know we have uh basically the

424
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,558
teams get integrated and if their

425
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:31,319
culture doesn't match your culture uh

426
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:33,058
just in the way they work or that won't

427
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:35,099
work I mean that's the most fundamental

428
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:37,139
thing so there has to be a culture match

429
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:40,319
with that with a joint venture

430
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,520
Partnerships so I think culture is the

431
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,918
most important

432
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,720
First Fundamental piece if I was going

433
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,160
to give every one of you a piece of

434
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,380
advice because everyone loves

435
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,538
unsolicited advice

436
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,919
um it would be that you have to open

437
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:56,759
your mind

438
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:58,320
to the possibility of a connection I

439
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:00,000
really believe that if you think

440
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,159
everyone that comes at you as a

441
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,720
colleague and not a competitor and you

442
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,480
think because I think sometimes people

443
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,240
are like well that person's competitive

444
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,579
to me well you may be competitive in one

445
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,160
thing that you overlap and then if you

446
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:16,379
do become Partners you figure out you

447
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,019
either retain that peace do it yourself

448
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,360
but if you can figure out how to make

449
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:24,359
that person

450
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:26,939
uh their gaps fill your gaps you become

451
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:29,759
stronger but you have to be willing to

452
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:32,100
give up a little bit of something and

453
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:33,779
that might be control

454
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:35,759
um you know some of us have control

455
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:39,058
issues I don't know I don't have control

456
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:40,019
issues but some of us do anybody want to

457
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:42,538
add something

458
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:45,480
I think that the biggest thing is

459
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:48,779
understanding what your strength is and

460
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,579
where you exceed and and nobody's going

461
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:53,579
to do it by themselves all right

462
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:55,319
especially in this industry and in most

463
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:58,079
Industries so you've got to really

464
00:19:55,319 --> 00:20:00,720
understand where you need the help and

465
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,339
it's got to be a symbiotic relationship

466
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,079
where you're going to help them they're

467
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:05,819
going to help you we do it with

468
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,980
Regulators I do it with some of the

469
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:11,639
states in the U.S we've got Consultants

470
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:13,919
that we work with as well uh it's what I

471
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,538
give you and what you give me and

472
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,640
sometimes you're going to give me more

473
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:19,919
sometimes I'm going to give you more but

474
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,600
at the end we're both going to be rising

475
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,520
and we're not going to be you have to be

476
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:25,678
generous and you have you have to be

477
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,720
willing to give more and be generous it

478
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,460
always pays you back we've had

479
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,919
competitors that we've we've worked with

480
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,480
competitors where we provide products

481
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,640
that they don't have actually for

482
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,220
Downstream processing

483
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,080
um and you know it works works well

484
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,480
um they're not afraid to help your

485
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:45,538
competitor no I've had calls with them

486
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,400
and yeah no we you talk in shows like

487
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:49,740
this are really great for meeting people

488
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,620
and you know it's on a it's on a

489
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:55,740
personal basis so but

490
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:57,779
and I love oh

491
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,579
I love what you're saying and that you

492
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:00,899
operate that way and how you answer the

493
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:03,859
other question it sounds like you're

494
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:06,120
you're You're Building uh ecosystems

495
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:07,678
within your strategic partner

496
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:09,659
communities which is important I just

497
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:14,580
wanted to

498
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:16,320
um also add that what is really great I

499
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:18,538
think one of the big overriding themes

500
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,460
of conversations I've had today hearing

501
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:23,960
about people that are setting up in

502
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:25,798
Europe is the idea of coopetition

503
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,019
which

504
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:29,879
um seems to be something that the

505
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:34,139
European cannabis Community is grasping

506
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:37,260
because it's so challenging here and

507
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:40,200
that has been missing a lot for the most

508
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:41,400
part outside aside from what you're

509
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,679
saying we're saying up here has been

510
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,080
missing in in the American cannabis

511
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,780
industry uh it's more like crabs in a

512
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:49,859
barrel and I think the co-op position

513
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:52,619
attitude everyone's taking here is

514
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:57,558
really really key it's

515
00:21:52,619 --> 00:22:00,538
um and if if you're not afraid to refer

516
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:03,899
uh business and clients and whatnot

517
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:06,359
around it it it comes back it's just

518
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,919
again I'll I'll probably mention a dozen

519
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:10,678
more times just the whole Goodwill thing

520
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,960
it's a it's a big small community and

521
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:15,900
coopetition is where it's at

522
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,960
Petra no I just wanted to add something

523
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:21,419
with uh regarding the competition for us

524
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,558
for example the competition is a Target

525
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:24,659
customer

526
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:28,440
because they need products and I know

527
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:30,360
I'm the first one to know how bad it is

528
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:34,320
if you don't have a good product on the

529
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:37,139
market and I know their their needs so I

530
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:40,500
think to to know what you do best like

531
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:45,799
George said before is the key key

532
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:49,859
ingredient to to adjust to the

533
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:51,179
risky competition yeah I love that I

534
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:53,579
mean you're all basically saying the

535
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:56,220
same thing coopetition helping a

536
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:58,859
competitor knowing your strengths it's

537
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:00,419
basically being generous with your

538
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:03,000
spirit with your time in cannabis we

539
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:05,580
have to do that we all need help but

540
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,679
we're talking about it what I don't

541
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:09,720
think everybody realizes

542
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,640
is that these two gentlemen at the end

543
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,380
are doing a strategic partnership with

544
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,960
that microphone

545
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:18,000
right oh yeah so they're they're

546
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,240
actually doing it

547
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,798
that was a cute observation

548
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,419
okay I want to know if there's any

549
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,220
questions from the audience for our

550
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:27,840
group I don't know when does our panel

551
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:30,839
end

552
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,339
never it's good it's ongoing we're stuck

553
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:34,918
here I think it's when the drinks are

554
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:39,058
ready right I just want are we done at

555

556
00:23:39,058 --> 00:23:44,399
oh you have a question

557
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:47,659
tour this is tour hamler of uh green

558
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,659
Nexus seed salt

559
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:55,099
when you get new opportunities

560
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,100
to work with people

561
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,259
[Music]

562
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:07,019
that's a great question okay so do you

563
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:10,139
have a process for evaluating new um

564
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:13,038
opportunities absolutely absolutely it

565
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:15,480
is absolutely disciplined okay because

566
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,700
first of all

567
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,220
um like like in my business we have we

568
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:22,080
can go in a hundred different directions

569
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:24,240
we could have you know ingredients

570
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,519
company from DuPont calling us you know

571
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,380
asking us to do something we have uh

572
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:30,900
like fermentation we have uh

573
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:33,360
fermentation companies we have um let's

574
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,280
say oil and gas companies no kidding uh

575
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:36,779
so when you have broad-based

576
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,000
Technologies you get and you do

577
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:43,500
broad-based marketing you're gonna get

578
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,259
in a a whole bunch of different uh types

579
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:49,619
of uh you know inquiries okay and and

580
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:51,599
requests so how do you sift through all

581
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:55,079
those to make a disciplined approach

582
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:57,418
well you really have to start first with

583
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:59,460
your strategy in mind you you must have

584
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:01,679
a company strategy and and your vision

585
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,840
for your company uh you you should have

586
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,400
that in a three-year goal uh what What's

587
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:08,459
our company going to look like you need

588
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,380
to describe what that looks like uh to

589
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,900
to your employees to your business

590
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,580
development people and then

591
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:17,159
um you need to have your company values

592
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:19,678
really well established so that you can

593
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:21,059
understand okay well maybe that doesn't

594
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,980
fit because that's not in our company

595
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:25,079
value oil and gas company comes to us

596
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,278
we're a sustainable company okay we you

597
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:28,619
know let them go do their with what

598
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:32,038
they're going to do okay the last thing

599
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:34,319
I would say is you really back in the

600
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:37,200
90s everybody was doing these strategy

601
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:40,019
Maps Okay and I think it's a really

602
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,140
great discipline it has allowed us to

603
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:44,940
follow a market strategy which is okay

604
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,500
we're going to invest in the Cannabis

605
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,778
Market that's an that's a market

606
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,819
strategy and then we tie that to a

607
00:25:48,778 --> 00:25:52,919
product strategy with a strategy map

608
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:54,599
okay well here's the process here's what

609
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:56,400
it looks like at one step one step two

610
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:59,519
step three and we just look upstream and

611
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,140
downstream of that and Upstream Upstream

612
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,240
of where we're operating those are

613
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,559
potential Partnerships Downstream of

614
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,500
where we're operating those are

615
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:10,139
potential Partnerships because they um

616
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,460
they not only we can provide Channel but

617
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,919
if they're not Market stream or

618
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,860
Downstream then then they're out then

619
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,380
they're out yeah they yeah there's also

620
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:21,599
a triage committee on this

621
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:24,360
um and usually you have to have your

622
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,859
Executives involved in that okay are we

623
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:28,678
going to go after this Market or are we

624
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:31,798
not right you can't do everything and I

625
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:35,400
I tell you the truth that if you are

626
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:37,558
very focused in on uh success with one

627
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,700
single Market strategy it is a superior

628
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:43,500
strategy I mean it it just is so like

629
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,640
Market strategies are really great we

630
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,558
have lots of different products

631
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,299
everybody up here has lots of different

632
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,158
products

633
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:52,619
um you know I think you're right because

634
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,419
in the Cannabis industry we say it's

635
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:55,918
easy to get the something shiny syndrome

636
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:58,380
right because there's opportunity

637
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,000
everywhere right and if Chinese if

638
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,460
you're like constantly being distracted

639
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,679
by this that or the other thing if you

640
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,960
have one strategy and you do that one

641
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:09,480
thing and you do it really well that's a

642
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,980
good item for quarterly goals so the

643
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,900
other thing is we have a framework

644
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,240
process also that we run I mean we have

645
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:18,298
quarterly meetings with our with our top

646
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,099
staff okay and then also on r d r d is

647
00:27:18,298 --> 00:27:23,038
where all this stuff comes in right and

648
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:26,339
you get all the great ideas every idea

649
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:28,558
goes on a list and we we process it and

650
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:30,839
according to uh according to a process

651
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:34,079
and uh and then you bump it up against

652
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:36,658
your values your part your strategy yes

653
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:38,220
all that the purpose of strategy is to

654
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:39,840
kill stuff you know that's the purpose

655
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,640
of strategy so you can kill it because

656
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:44,939
there's too many ideas there's too many

657
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,380
markets uh to go after there's too many

658
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,120
um different potential Partnerships

659
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,860
they're they're all over the place so

660
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:52,558
the question is which ones make the most

661
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:54,538
sense for your organization which ones

662
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:59,158
will fit with your organization and fill

663
00:27:54,538 --> 00:28:01,379
in gaps and which where where the joint

664
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:06,059
venture will be profitable for both

665
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:08,039
entities and you know we don't I think

666
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:10,379
that I would say early in my career we

667
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:13,558
had a less disciplined way of doing JVS

668
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:15,419
and those are those are all gone all of

669
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:18,538
those JVS are gone they either didn't

670
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:21,120
work or they weren't you know Partners

671
00:28:18,538 --> 00:28:22,859
weren't right or whatever focus focus is

672
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:26,759
the thing and and make sure you do a

673
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:28,859
process run the process because uh even

674
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:31,200
with a two-man company or a two lady

675
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:33,719
company or whatever even with a small

676
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,120
company you can you can follow a market

677
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,400
strategy and you can still say here's my

678
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:40,139
values here's my three-year goal and and

679
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,700
here's my big rocks that I'm going to be

680
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,259
working on and review those every

681
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,840
quarter so that you don't get off track

682
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:47,759
because you can destroy your business

683
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:50,298
pursuing a dream of someone else and you

684
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,298
don't want to do that

685
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:54,900

686

Portugal working on uh mainly on the

694
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,600
hemp business but also on medical

695
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:36,599
cannabis my main question uh of so many

696
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:39,298
questions I would ask you all and by the

697
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:42,439
way thank you so much George Terry for

698
00:29:39,298 --> 00:29:45,898
being probably one of the the only

699
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:49,140
representative of uh other genetic human

700
00:29:45,898 --> 00:29:52,619
groups here I don't mean to to blame the

701
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:54,179
fact that uh what about ungayo yes but

702
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:58,519
especially today it looks like large

703
00:29:54,179 --> 00:30:02,460
story we look alike yeah

704
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:06,480
so my main question is we've seen a lot

705
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:09,419
of movements lately uh it looks like

706
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:12,599
Colombia for example was being hauled

707
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:14,659
for so long oh no exportations clever

708
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:18,678
leaves broke that

709
00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:21,600
and now we have South America

710
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:23,278
providing the Western the Northern

711
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:25,819
Western Hemisphere

712
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:29,460
also on the hemp side let me tell you

713
00:30:25,819 --> 00:30:30,798
Zimbabwe is provided in providing to

714
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:35,659
Europe

715
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:38,700
uh very very cheap the question is I'm

716
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:41,399
formulating if you allow me he's selling

717
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:45,298
a lot of CBD African CBD to Europe now

718
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:48,359
for extractions so this show at least

719
00:30:45,298 --> 00:30:50,639
suggests that in the near future all

720
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:52,979
these billionaire Investments that are

721
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:57,480
being being done in North America and in

722
00:30:52,980 --> 00:31:01,620
Europe have their days count so what

723
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:05,899
strategies to adapt to a point where

724
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:07,979
cannabis is a commodity being

725
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:10,798
cheaply produced in the southern

726
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,120
hemisphere what's the strategy for the

727
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:14,519
companies here in the Northern Western

728
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:16,798
Hemisphere to that thank you

729
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:18,960
well from my perspective we're actually

730
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:21,898
we actually have a unit Columbia where

731
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,440
put units in Canada and we're now almost

732
00:31:21,898 --> 00:31:26,699
GMP here in the EU

733
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:30,360
we've actually

734
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:32,759
uh contracted with consultants in the in

735
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:35,339
this area much like Jamie

736
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:37,500
um to bring us into this this uh this

737
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:39,240
area the key thing and and I said this

738
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:42,599
in Berlin is know your regulatory

739
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:45,240
landscape know what you what's required

740
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:46,439
of you of what you have to do and the

741
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,319
partners that you'll need to get you

742
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:52,860
there so when we first came in to the EU

743
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:55,019
at ICBC in Berlin two years ago we

744
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:57,119
didn't know anything got a consultant

745
00:31:55,019 --> 00:32:00,240
that knew the market brought on

746
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:01,979
attorneys in Germany in Dusseldorf and

747
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:06,179
other Consultants brought in a

748
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:10,319
consultant in Canada that for us to get

749
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:14,159
IQ oqpq so that we were able to to do

750
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:16,259
the GMP process so we knew I knew we

751
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,799
weren't going to do it alone

752
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:22,259
um you have to understand what you're

753
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:25,619
what you need from those people and set

754
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:27,359
timelines for example you know

755
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:29,099
I said this is not going to be a

756
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:30,719
three-year process I want this to be a

757
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:33,000
one-year process it ended up being a

758
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,460
two-year process so set a timeline have

759
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,259
milestones and just involve other people

760
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,278
pick the right people it might cost you

761
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:40,980
some money

762
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:43,019
all right also

763
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:47,278
um we also have people that are in the

764
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:49,859
industry like uh Xavier you know the

765
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:52,140
um he's been excellent to us you know

766
00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:54,959
he's he's connected us to a lot of the

767
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:56,820
people in this room and Maria and

768
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,038
um and some of the other people that are

769
00:32:56,819 --> 00:33:01,740
very famous in this room in the Cannabis

770
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:03,538
world so events like this are very

771
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,579
important guys because you get to

772
00:33:03,538 --> 00:33:07,740
network with people and you get to learn

773
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:09,119
about other people's business of what

774
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,220
their other hurdles are and what their

775
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:13,558
other strategies are and you get the

776
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,659
Intelligence on what's going on hey you

777
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:16,619
know malta's moving ahead of Germany

778
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:18,480
really

779
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:21,000
you know who's yeah that's where the

780
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,740
Consultants LeapFrog you

781
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,740
um they might cost you some money but

782
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:28,200
the time that you spend figuring it out

783
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:32,240
for yourself costs you the same money

784
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:35,460
but time is value I mean it's the the

785
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,798
compounding factor for a lot of that I

786
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:39,899
would say to answer your question

787
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:42,000
um I would mimic what George is saying

788
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:43,619
that you you need to know what all the

789
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,960
compliance things are so for example

790
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:47,518
when the German regulation the draft

791
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,038
regulations came out and they said they

792
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,720
were not allowing import

793
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:53,940
understanding why is that the draft

794
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:57,298
regulation and then

795
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:01,200
perhaps hiring a regulatory consultant

796
00:33:57,298 --> 00:34:02,940
to go do some lobbying to get the law

797
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,700
changed so that you can get your product

798
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:08,519
in or find the work around maybe you get

799
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:10,800
your product into Portugal do the EU GMP

800
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:12,599
certified dance and then get that

801
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,780
product can go somewhere else there's

802
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:17,820
always a workaround if you find it but

803
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,200
you got to know what the rules are I I

804
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,320
would say that

805
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:24,358
you're right South America I have a

806
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,580
client that's a Colombian company that's

807
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:30,838
currently working in Switzerland they're

808
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:34,980
producing great cannabis so cheaply

809
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:37,440
but it isn't welcome right now

810
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:41,159
for a lot of reasons and some of that is

811
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,320
if you're in Germany and you're going to

812
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:46,559
have an industry and the EU is not going

813
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:49,379
to approve you because you can't cross

814
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:51,418
borders they're waiting for that EU

815
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:53,338
approval and that might be one of the

816
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:56,158
hurdles so right now Germans are saying

817
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:59,159
maybe we're not going to have border

818
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:02,700
crossing for rec but they will have it

819
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:04,980
for adult or for medical so it just

820
00:35:02,699 --> 00:35:07,259
boils down to knowing what the rules are

821
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:10,260
yeah I think I would also begin with the

822
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:11,760
end I mean you you want to be in the

823
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:14,400
growing area you want to leverage maybe

824
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,079
some land that you have or uh you're

825
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,119
looking at the market saying wow this is

826
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,859
supposed to have a very high come on a

827
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:21,660
new growth rate okay so I want to be in

828
00:35:19,858 --> 00:35:24,838
this market okay why don't you begin

829
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:27,059
with the end go go get your takeoffs go

830
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:28,679
go get the takeoff agreements go get the

831
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:30,900
contracts

832
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:33,719
um you know you know go do your business

833
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:36,420
development up front just make sure that

834
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:38,819
you have that uh you know that base

835
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,579
business if you rely on distribution

836
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:43,500
after the fact you you're way behind the

837
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:45,119
eight ball That's a classic mistake yeah

838
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,559
I'm gonna grow some weed it's going to

839
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,300
be great now I've got a bunch of weed

840
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:50,880
right okay what do I do with it that

841
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,260
doesn't work I mean it just doesn't your

842
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,380
your weed's gonna sit there for a year

843
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:57,540
and and it's not going to be sold so

844
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,280
what you need to do is is go do that

845
00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:01,380
business development first you should be

846
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,839
hitting all the shows you should be on

847
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:05,599
the ultimate networker you should be you

848
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:08,759
know before you start growing anything

849
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,680
and you know a lot of people like oh how

850
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,140
do you find those people all right how

851
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:16,858
do I find that well okay LinkedIn is

852
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:18,480
awesome you guys everybody here has uh I

853
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:20,639
mean we're we're a LinkedIn Stars right

854
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,380
okay so go on LinkedIn and find and

855
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:24,779
start a conversation everything starts

856
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:27,180
with the conversation yep Petra yeah

857
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:30,480
it's the same with our business so when

858
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:33,239
you do a product you you firstly the the

859
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,880
main thing that you need to know is who

860
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:38,159
is your customer and customer and why

861
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,079
are you doing this for them and what are

862
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:43,279
you doing for them that is I think

863
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:46,800
that's really important to know and

864
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,839
we actually are lucky to have Slovenia

865
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:53,160
being so small so we have a 2 million

866
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:54,980
population to test right the things and

867
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:57,719
um it's really

868
00:36:54,980 --> 00:37:00,420
interesting how some products don't do

869
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:03,659
that well on the market when you thought

870
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:06,240
that would be a hit or a bomb and this

871
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:10,379
will sell really well usually it's up

872
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:13,199
the opposite and it's nice to know where

873
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:15,480
where the where to go and to adjust

874
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:18,779
quickly

875
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,940
um because the time difference that

876
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,820
comes from one product to another

877
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:27,019
product is really important so

878
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:30,599
um when you place something on a market

879
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:32,280
you should always be ready to make

880
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:35,519
adjustment really fast and I think

881
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,380
that's the key one of the key things to

882
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:39,239
be successful in but not to create more

883
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,519
business too and it's a risky business

884
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:44,699
because we don't know what will happen

885
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:47,759
tomorrow with the regulations so it's

886
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:50,338
the it's the Catch-22 you need to be

887
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,040
ready to Pivot quickly yeah

888
00:37:50,338 --> 00:37:55,739
um but that is expensive so you want to

889
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:58,320
you want to buy packaging at scale and

890
00:37:55,739 --> 00:38:02,598
then you buy a hundred thousand boxes

891
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:05,640
ouch and then regulation changes

892
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:07,619
don't do that but at the same time yeah

893
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:09,420
you know you got to be ready you have to

894
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,640
predict some things that could happen

895
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:15,420
and you have to have deep enough Pockets

896
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:17,519
yeah to allow for things to not go right

897
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,500
A lot of times the regulations and

898
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:21,539
that's my big thing because that's all I

899
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:24,358
deal with is regulations between 50

900
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:27,239
states and however many countries is

901
00:38:24,358 --> 00:38:28,980
they telepath and I'm not going to

902
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:31,858
figure it out sitting in Atlanta Georgia

903
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,960
or Fort Lauderdale that's where my

904
00:38:31,858 --> 00:38:35,819
friends in the industry call me up and

905
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,559
they say hey did you hear what's going

906
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,240
on with these guys or hey did you hear

907
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:40,739

00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:42,659
or whatever

909
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:44,039
those are the kind of Partnerships those

910
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:46,440
are the kind of friendships you want to

911
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:49,440
make in Colombia you know what's going

912
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,300
on in Canada what's going on in the EU

913
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,980
these are the kind of events where you

914
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:55,800
can make those those uh those those

915
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:58,079
friendships so that you know hey I know

916
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,180
somebody who's in Canada or I know

917
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,119
somebody who's in Slovenia or I know

918
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:05,578
somebody who's in you know the U.S

919
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,500
um and and let me reach out to them and

920
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:08,760
see if they've heard anything well and I

921
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,639
always I can't tell you how many times

922
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,980
today I said to people don't assume I

923
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:16,920
know I would rather hear the same piece

924
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:18,000
of information 40 times than never hear

925
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,980
it because everyone's like oh Jamie

926
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,420
already knows that if you hear something

927
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,420
and you think

928
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:27,380
somebody needs to know it be a resource

929
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:30,659
share the information

930
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:33,838
I think that's important what time is it

931
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:36,000
and when do we end it is 5 16 and we end

932
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:37,980
at 5 15 but if there's one more question

933
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,940
one more question from the audience is

934
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:44,099
there one more oh why do you wait

935
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:46,820
Greg Dunaway Maple Creek Consulting what

936
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:46,820
can we do for you

937
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:54,960
as the industry scales up you're one of

938
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,700
the top Recruiters in the United States

939
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,159
what are the pivotal positions for

940
00:39:56,699 --> 00:40:01,439
people in Europe that you see either

941
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:03,838
being filled poorly as companies scale

942
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,940
in the U.S or are difficult to place for

943
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,039
you

944
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:11,659
wow

945
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,659
um way to save the easy one

946
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:17,399
uh I mean so we we we do live in the

947
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:19,078
constant state of being called on to

948
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,119
fill the the difficult to fill roles

949
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:22,920
that's where I want to live I don't want

950
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,099
our clients to just feel like they have

951
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:28,260
to call us with everything uh you know

952
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:29,460
um and I don't know so I actually had

953
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,540
this conversation earlier with some

954
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,338
other people I don't know if the

955
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:34,500
European market is there yet but really

956
00:40:32,338 --> 00:40:36,179
difficult to fill roles are head of

957
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,579
legal how to finance we do a lot of

958
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:40,379
those I don't it a lot of people here

959
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:42,300
told me that the market here is not

960
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:44,338
mature enough to eat a lot of that

961
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,859
hiring but those are really difficult to

962
00:40:44,338 --> 00:40:49,679
fill roles I don't know if it'll be as

963
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:51,900
difficult in Europe as it's been in the

964
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:53,578
states for CFOs in particular because of

965
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,519
the current state of the industry with

966
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:57,960
Federal prohibition because that's a

967
00:40:56,519 --> 00:41:00,059
really risky role you're asking someone

968
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,800
to take on a lot of risk and put their

969
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:03,659
name on a lot of signature on a lot of

970
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,400
things that maybe haven't been done

971
00:41:03,659 --> 00:41:08,578
before are you filling them with the

972
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:11,280
infractional people uh not yet not yet

973
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:13,920
but we we do expect more of that to

974
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,260
happen and a lot of those uh

975
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,700
professionals are more and more and more

976
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,200
interested in fractional roles and

977
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:21,480
outside the U.S role and then are you

978
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:24,259
bringing Americans with that experience

979
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:28,260
over to Europe I look forward to it okay

980
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:31,260
good to know I think we're done here

981
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:33,599
