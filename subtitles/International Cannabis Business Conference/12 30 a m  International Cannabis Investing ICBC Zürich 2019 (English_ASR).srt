1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,370
there we go okay so just a disclaimer

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,259
before I start I'm not a lawyer I'm not

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,609
an accountant I'm not an investment

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,290
banker I'm a managing director of

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:12,779
venture funds and private equity funds

6
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:14,339
in the US and internationally just

7
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,679
purely business consulting it's like

8
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:18,689
what our other company does so from a

9
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:20,910
disclaimer side always find good lawyers

10
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,920
lots of good examples for those that

11
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,618
know cannabis international regulations

12
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,330
business finance and for accounting I've

13
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:30,059
seen some of the best billion dollar

14
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:31,678
companies in cannabis [ __ ] up major

15
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:34,019
things because they didn't understand

16
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,299
tax treaties withholdings implications

17
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,890
so this is cannabis we're gonna talk

18
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:39,839
about but also know that the normal

19
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,750
business structures are most likely

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,359
gonna be the keys to success or failure

21
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,210
and I also may offend your country or

22
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,378
your city or your company I won't I'm

23
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,448
not trying to do it it's nothing

24
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:54,049
personal but just from what we've seen

25
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:56,339
in the industry for over thirteen years

26
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:58,500
you just kind of have to tell it how it

27
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,010
is and I also swear sometimes so

28
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,929
apologies in advance just a little bit

29
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:07,438
about my background originally from

30
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:08,579
Wisconsin small like farm country never

31
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,949
thought I would go from farming in

32
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:12,989
Wisconsin to cannabis agriculture but

33
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,609
essentially after high school I was in

34
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:16,859
the United States Air Force got hurt

35
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:18,810
flipped a coin went to Colorado and

36
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:20,670
started a small cannabis consulting

37
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,978
company right when medical cannabis was

38
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,990
changing from cards on the wall to

39
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:26,819
commercial and something very important

40
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:29,009
about Colorado is we were the first

41
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:31,828
program in the world that commercialized

42
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,019
medical cannabis we were also the first

43
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:35,789
place in the world that legalized

44
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:37,709
recreational cannabis better than

45
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,229
anything Amsterdam ever could talk about

46
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:44,219
or Spanish clubs like 21 or older

47
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:46,170
standardized products tested taxes six

48
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,179
plus billion dollars in revenue for a

49
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,399
six million person state and then

50
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,270
Washington and California and Oregon

51
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,310
Alaska and Nevada and now Massachusetts

52
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:58,438
and you know Maine another state we're

53
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,780
at nine states in DC that's almost like

54
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:02,849
10 places out of 50 with recreational

55
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,290
cannabis in the United States so I've

56
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:06,868
worked in 30 States

57
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,729
we've won licenses in 24 states to like

58
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:10,979
start these businesses medical cannabis

59
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,629
and recreational so definitely new the

60
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,390
US side and then we started

61
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:16,939
international

62
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:19,279
2014 so doing LP work in Canada and then

63
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:21,259
those first German tenders and then two

64
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,449
of the 11 Danish licenses on and on and

65
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:25,639
on so the us we got a really good

66
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:27,949
understanding of what not to do state by

67
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:29,839
state by state and then internationally

68
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:31,818
equally have learned what programs work

69
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,439
what programs don't what's a good

70
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,509
investment but always looking at this

71
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,939
from the main focus of agriculture

72
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:40,609
business manufacturing and distribution

73
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:42,139
and distribution every company that

74
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,030
talks about brands that doesn't

75
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:46,309
understand distribution in their state

76
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,560
in their country or how aeramax might

77
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,598
work with international pharmaceutical

78
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,699
distribution you're wrong why build a

79
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:54,108
brand one if it sucks and your product

80
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:56,238
sucks and you have no way to get it to

81
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:58,129
market or like in California right now

82
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,019
there's so many companies that are

83
00:02:58,128 --> 00:03:02,120
paying for shelf space and have

84
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:03,620
distribution licenses and lock out the

85
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,079
small producers from being able to get

86
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,609
their products to dispensaries now

87
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:09,349
that's very different than like Germany

88
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:11,870
and having an import license Pharma

89
00:03:09,348 --> 00:03:12,889
distribution license pharmacies and

90
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,299
actually having doctors with

91
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:15,949
prescriptions so always remember the

92
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:18,590
u.s. is one thing international is

93
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:21,229
another and us quasi medical kind of

94
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,329
adult international is medical

95
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:25,668
pharmaceutical and you have to always

96
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:27,560
keep that in mind even though we all

97
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:29,510
know that recreational cannabis is going

98
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,598
to be legal everywhere or in most places

99
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:34,310
it's like when and not so much an if but

100
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:36,199
every single time in the United States

101
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,959
there was a medical program that

102
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:40,939
transitioned to recreational a hundred

103
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,650
percent of the time medical licenses and

104
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:44,930
companies had first write a refusal or

105
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,949
preference to get into those markets so

106
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,510
as you're doing international

107
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:49,760
pharmaceutical and medical cannabis

108
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:51,409
development also know if a hundred

109
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,598
percent of the time in other places this

110
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:55,430
has happened it's probably gonna rain

111
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:59,298
true just like it did in Canada and

112
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:01,370
similar with Uruguay so on a global side

113
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:03,169
you know we started like that little

114
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,090
kind of blue state in the middle there

115
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:07,250
in the United States but having done

116
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,409
cannabis industry for 13 years and

117
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,719
seeing like those new states or a new

118
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:13,159
country look at Germany's first program

119
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:16,668
it's like we're gonna have licenses for

120
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:18,500
200 kilos a year each like that was a

121
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:20,180
joke like and then they realized they're

122
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,098
like oh [ __ ] this was this crazy program

123
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,110
you had to mail stuff from bond partners

124
00:04:22,098 --> 00:04:25,670
madness like we're gonna take all those

125
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,160
back and do another program like

126
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:30,710
every program is a guinea pig market or

127
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,630
how do we test for pesticides or what's

128
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:34,459
the tax rate that we have for this every

129
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:37,430
program is a new example of what not to

130
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:38,870
do and as many I recognize lots of good

131
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,120
companies here and new people starting

132
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,590
companies you have to know what not to

133
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,870
do in these other markets and don't

134
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:47,750
repeat the same mistakes of other past

135
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,819
markets but as you see it's starting and

136
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,079
every continent other than Antarctica

137
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:53,689
and I still like anyone who has a

138
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:54,979
research license in Antarctica like we

139
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:56,990
want to get down there so it's like

140
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,660
seven continents but like we're around

141
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,009
the globe with medical cannabis but how

142
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,740
it started in California with

143
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:05,389
compassionate care like 1996 how that's

144
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,639
transitioned in the United States to

145
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:09,800
have 44 states in one way or another out

146
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:12,500
of 50 have some sort of cannabis program

147
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,079
31 medical states that's over half and

148
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,490
like our government can't like go after

149
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:18,709
this so when you think about what we did

150
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,120
in the United States some of the

151
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:21,319
examples we'll go over for Canada and

152
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,769
what's happening in the rest of the

153
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:24,259
world

154
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:26,240
it's very indicative of other markets

155
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:27,769
and what you look at like after

156
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,990
prohibition in the United States when

157
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:31,819
alcohol was illegal and made legal what

158
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,740
happened in those five 10 years after

159
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:35,480
that moment happened this is

160
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,879
pharmaceutical international like drug

161
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,280
discovery drug development huge

162
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:42,740
opportunity like tech and it's gonna

163
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:45,109
happen but not every single country is

164
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,300
gonna be growing tobacco in a warehouse

165
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:49,220
to sell tobacco in that country or

166
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,680
outdoor like we grow things

167
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,240
agriculturally we import we export and

168
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,389
now the markets starting to allow that

169
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,639
and change the problem in the u.s.

170
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:01,159
though like even being a veteran loving

171
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,349
my country like what I do in America is

172
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,570
federally illegal like every single

173
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,580
thing which was federally illegal aiding

174
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:11,060
abetting manufacturer of pretty much a

175
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:13,550
Schedule one narcotic heroin like worth

176
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,829
the same so when we go state-by-state

177
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,840
every single state is almost like a new

178
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:19,519
country think about like kind of the EU

179
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,229
and there's different little regulations

180
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,810
there but we have no interstate commerce

181
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:26,629
so I can't grow cannabis in Colorado and

182
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,459
then ship that to another state so it's

183
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:29,899
always like right now with all the

184
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:31,699
companies that you're hearing about it's

185
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:33,769
always based on the licenses in those

186
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:35,930
states or you have to have like local

187
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:37,039
county control and then state control

188
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,590
and like Department of Health

189
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,689
apartment of Agriculture new rules in

190
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:44,089
each jurisdiction and internationally is

191
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:46,250
the exact same every country might have

192
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:49,009
their own policies regulations what can

193
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,720
be imported what can be sold who can do

194
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:53,000
it how many licenses there are and

195
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,250
license number determines business

196
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,910
success you think about states like

197
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,410
Colorado Washington Oregon California

198
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:03,200
unlimited licenses if you get me Nissa

199
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:05,840
Pell approval Colorado over a thousand

200
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,149
cultivation licenses Washington thirteen

201
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:11,029
hundred you think like Portugal there's

202
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:12,919
three very very different from a

203
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:14,989
competition basis of how much you can

204
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,090
grow what products like our vaporizers

205
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,160
are allowed our edibles allowed some

206
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:22,099
states won't allow flour just oil other

207
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,439
states just flour and no edible products

208
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,180
some states no beverages some states no

209
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:28,699
refrigerated products so you have to

210
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:31,699
know the individual market dynamics of a

211
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:33,469
production country or state but when you

212
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:35,389
have lots of licenses in places like

213
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:38,000
that the price per per pound or let's

214
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:40,879
say like half a kilo like a pound was

215
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,160
like forty four hundred dollars us now

216
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,379
in Colorado that's around six seven

217
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,570
eight hundred so what happened tons of

218
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:50,089
licenses greenhouses lowering the cost

219
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:53,269
of production outdoor allowed indoor

220
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:54,979
kind of went away and like it's still

221
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:56,689
there but the cost of production you

222
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,670
have to know each of these markets so if

223
00:07:56,689 --> 00:08:00,800
it's costing you four times more to grow

224
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:03,770
a gram then let's say greenhouse

225
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,790
compliantly as the market drops there's

226
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:06,799
a certain point that if you're not

227
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:09,410
profitable we said in 2010 if you're not

228
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,090
profitable at $500 a pound like a market

229
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,580
price you're already going out of

230
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:15,799
business now the only time that some of

231
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:17,659
these states matter when you just have

232
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,939
just a cultivation license or an

233
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,590
extraction license or both is when

234
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:24,290
you're making that additional value add

235
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:26,149
of like growing cannabis extracting oils

236
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:28,220
making products and making standardized

237
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:30,169
brands and the United States brands are

238
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:32,360
a big deal a lot of them aren't that

239
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:35,120
quality but it's really hard to brand

240
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,250
let's say a certain type of Apple

241
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,200
compared to like an apple sauce company

242
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,940
so we see this transition of

243
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,610
standardizing with brands but brands in

244
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,680
the US and Canada very different than

245
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:48,000
brands internationally so brands

246
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,409
internationally actually don't matter

247
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,230
when it comes to medical pharmaceutical

248
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:54,539
what does matter is quality and your

249
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,829
price if you meet the quality standard

250
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:57,438
and you're the lowest price you're the

251
00:08:55,828 --> 00:09:00,179
generic practically in the whole country

252
00:08:57,438 --> 00:09:01,500
especially if you have distribution so

253
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:03,448
some of the examples from the US are

254
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,909
very very helpful but they're also a

255
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:07,169
hindrance if you're trying to copy

256
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:08,818
United States model or the Canadian

257
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:11,909
model for the rest of the world

258
00:09:08,818 --> 00:09:13,198
those two are flawed programs and how

259
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:15,688
they operated but now with like

260
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:18,088
Portuguese companies Swiss CBD companies

261
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:19,769
German companies the Danish companies

262
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:22,319
it's starting to happen but where you

263
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:23,850
are matters not every license in every

264
00:09:22,318 --> 00:09:26,639
state is good I have cultivators in

265
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,980
Alaska way up north with greenhouses the

266
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,688
price per pound is like 3500 pounds

267
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,420
still but like their cost of production

268
00:09:30,688 --> 00:09:35,188
is just ridiculous so once the United

269
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:37,229
States legalized is medical which will

270
00:09:35,188 --> 00:09:40,169
happen first then we'll see some like

271
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,300
international policies kind of start to

272
00:09:40,169 --> 00:09:44,399
transform and like interstate commerce

273
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:46,948
when recreational happens in the United

274
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,809
States all those grow houses built in

275
00:09:46,948 --> 00:09:51,120
downtown Las Vegas are going to be

276
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:54,119
obsolete but you think like Las Vegas

277
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,789
like Party Sin City that County for

278
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,919
example wouldn't allow any flower grown

279
00:09:56,789 --> 00:10:00,688
outside of that County to be sold in

280
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:02,698
Clark County originally so then you had

281
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:05,278
to build a building in the middle of the

282
00:10:02,698 --> 00:10:07,078
desert to grow a weed very very

283
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,688
expensively in a concrete building and

284
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:11,519
that that way only if the state doesn't

285
00:10:09,688 --> 00:10:14,188
allow greenhouse or outdoor and not just

286
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,659
like plastic in RedNet or like plastic

287
00:10:14,188 --> 00:10:18,208
greenhouses but like glass GMP

288
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:19,948
greenhouses if you can do that for

289
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:22,049
commercial production for control it's

290
00:10:19,948 --> 00:10:24,088
the only way to be a long-term relevant

291
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:25,620
company especially if you're doing oil

292
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:26,759
production if you're I mean look at

293
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,039
tweed look at some of these other

294
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:31,110
companies like when canopies considering

295
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,208
exiting all the production facilities

296
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:36,568
there's a reason because there's some

297
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:38,099
changes happening so we think about all

298
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:39,990
these new states all these new companies

299
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,699
all these new countries with policies

300
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,528
there's tons and tons of startup

301
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:44,909
companies we've worked with over 500

302
00:10:43,528 --> 00:10:47,129
just with our consulting company over

303
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:48,838
the last decade and when there's lots of

304
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:50,670
startup companies in a startup industry

305
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,980
there's going to be copious amounts of

306
00:10:50,669 --> 00:10:55,378
failures so it's an investor when I'm

307
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,808
managing other investors capital our own

308
00:10:55,379 --> 00:11:00,149
capital how you choose where you invest

309
00:10:57,808 --> 00:11:02,189
your time and and money is very very

310
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:04,590
important and just think first that

311
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,670
this is all sexy it's like medical

312
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:08,490
cannabis this is this new thing

313
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:10,559
happening business dynamics are more

314
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,269
important than anything cannabis we can

315
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:13,979
train cannabis you can learn this the

316
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:16,019
production the extraction the

317
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,539
distribution the science it's happening

318
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:20,939
but it's not a good team if it's in the

319
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:22,980
wrong market if there's major product

320
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,140
risk for like wrongful deaths and things

321
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,460
like that like that's all liabilities so

322
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:28,679
if you're thinking about a company and

323
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,360
how you're gonna scale that company to

324
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:32,309
get like a return on your investment if

325
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,159
there's those risk or it's not the right

326
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:37,349
team or the wrong market why even invest

327
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:38,969
there because just like coms like there

328
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:42,300
were so many that started but how many

329
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:44,129
turned into Google like how many of the

330
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:46,139
ride share programs turned into a brand

331
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:48,360
you they're their IPO aside from that

332
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:50,730
little kind of thing that happened there

333
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,279
it takes a long time to actually make a

334
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,870
big big company with value but if

335
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,490
there's those early warning signs or

336
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:59,310
they don't have good business dynamics

337
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,509
run because I mean right now even you

338
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:01,889
know let's say about a billion under

339
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:03,509
management if like certain sorts of

340
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:06,179
projects the amount of capital we've

341
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:08,490
seen wasted on garbage companies well

342
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:09,959
over ten billion not just in the United

343
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,789
States internationally as well you look

344
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,440
at some countries like we'll get into

345
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:14,789
Denmark for example all the startup

346
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,220
companies or those eleven that got

347
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:18,750
licenses which we helped with two of we

348
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,490
sold one cuz it's like why do you want

349
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,350
to produce in Denmark they have a thirty

350
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,779
two hour workweek their taxes are high

351
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,759
as hell and it's cold all the time other

352
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:28,289
than like that one part of the year not

353
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:30,210
a good place to grow agricultural

354
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,679
production for like international export

355
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,900
but it was the third country in the

356
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,029
world that had a pilot program to allow

357
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:38,159
export so there's value in being in a

358
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:39,720
market sometimes but not maybe putting

359
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,000
all of your positions and staying there

360
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,820
you have to be flexible otherwise if you

361
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,980
don't scale and change and adapt like

362
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,900
the market changes every day new

363
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,210
operators new countries new potential

364
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:53,429
threats UN like Interpol like all these

365
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:56,220
different regulations changing if you're

366
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:57,750
not very very agile you will get broken

367
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,420
and that's the difference from going to

368
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:03,809
start up like Series A Series B to like

369
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:04,889
actually like a public exit so when

370
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:06,479
you're thinking about like normal

371
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:09,088
investing in this if it's your time your

372
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,670
money or your company cover your ass for

373
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:13,320
the normal basis like think normal

374
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:14,949
business cannabis aside and then

375
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,270
specialize the business model for

376
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,460
Cannabis but if the business doesn't

377
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:20,379
make sense it's not gonna make anything

378
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:23,290
just because cannabis might be 3/4

379
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:24,730
thousand you know euros a kilo doesn't

380
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:26,919
mean that that's gonna be the case

381
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:28,240
forever or back in the day it was like

382
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:30,009
when you had a problem you throw money

383
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,810
at it but when you have lots of

384
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:34,600
competition and the prices are coming

385
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:36,459
down and standards are going up there's

386
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,990
this moment of breaking and we've seen

387
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,879
hundreds and hundreds of companies go

388
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,500
out of business in the United States and

389
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:43,600
internationally and then there's more

390
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,220
and more every day but focus on the

391
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,170
normal business dynamics just like a

392
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,120
normal investment and then understand

393
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:50,919
the cannabis part otherwise if you just

394
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,460
think cannabis will carry you it will

395
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:55,719
not yeah so like when I think about

396
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,940
actually like the risk of this

397
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,790
everything about cannabis like number

398
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:03,190
one is we are a compliance industry like

399
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:05,409
I love like we're a compliance industry

400
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,180
through being compliant we have the

401
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:10,059
privilege of cultivating manufacturing

402
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:11,679
and distributing cannabis products but

403
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:13,629
if it's not compliant if you don't know

404
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,519
the rules in that market or if you're

405
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:16,539
gonna start some like Swiss CBD company

406
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,129
and then you're gonna you're gonna be

407
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:19,569
selling to Germany you're gonna sell the

408
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:21,850
United States like what are the rules

409
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:23,200
you have to do to do that like if you

410
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,490
don't know what those rules are and have

411
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,710
good lawyers and actually do this

412
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,360
correctly you won't make any sales and

413
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,950
then that's no revenue and then you're

414
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,409
your time's wasted your investors

415
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:34,000
capitals wasted but the normal risk for

416
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:35,919
this it's knowing the rules and

417
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,750
compliance and if you focus on that

418
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,459
every company that we've gotten to like

419
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,649
a billion dollar type valuation has

420
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:44,769
always had compliance at the forefront

421
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:47,289
of everything over there logo over there

422
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:49,269
like wellness concept whatever special

423
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:51,370
thing they might have its compliance

424
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:53,500
first just like a normal business

425
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,720
compliance tax and legal then what's

426
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,309
next but if it's not good on those basis

427
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:01,690
we won't even go to the second page in a

428
00:14:57,309 --> 00:15:03,429
deck so medical when you think

429
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,980
internationally we used medical in the

430
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:07,539
United States to get cannabis legal and

431
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,340
I'm on the board of directors for

432
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:11,110
Americans for safe access disabled

433
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,960
veteran like I was a patient in Colorado

434
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:16,029
in 2007 at first everything is like

435
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,070
medical focus but it wasn't medical in

436
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:19,360
the United States there's no doctors

437
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:21,670
making prescriptions they make a

438
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,590
recommendation but then through that we

439
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:25,479
it allowed these medical programs to

440
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:27,639
start to get medicine to patients but

441
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,779
internationally it's not just use

442
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:30,730
medical to get rectly

443
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:32,350
this should be legal of course and it's

444
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,060
a very very medicinal plant we're just

445
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,740
beginning to understand so much more of

446
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:37,329
but we've kept around for hundreds of

447
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,440
thousands of years for a reason and

448
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,639
people have been willing to break the

449
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,380
law forever about it

450
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:44,049
it's [ __ ] cows are hilarious right

451
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:46,330
now is it awesome

452
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:47,769
it's like childhood here but if we don't

453
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:50,379
have a medical approach and what your

454
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:51,970
focus is internationally you'll fail and

455
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:52,809
also there's like we'll talk about a

456
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,790
little bit about the International

457
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:56,589
Narcotics Control Board kind of a big

458
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:58,839
deal like you don't want to be on their

459
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:00,519
[ __ ] list and most companies are any

460
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,220
country that's legalized recreational

461
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:05,230
cannabis is on the total [ __ ] list for

462
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,090
Interpol International Narcotics Control

463
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,899
Board and that would be like Canada and

464
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,910
Uruguay

465
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:11,439
thank God Mexico Supreme Court didn't go

466
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:13,480
forward with their one program and now

467
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,910
the medical program first but always

468
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,620
start medical and if you focus based on

469
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:19,959
the patient's and doctor education

470
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,399
that's how actually programs evolved

471
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,070
that was the main flaw with Germany

472
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:25,980
which we'll get into so there's

473
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:28,210
obviously demand like multi

474
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,279
trillion-dollar velocity of capital

475
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:32,200
industry happening illicitly as we speak

476
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:33,699
so when a risk standpoint it's like are

477
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,470
people gonna use this or not it's like

478
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,030
they already do we're gonna make it

479
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,670
better and cheaper and higher-quality

480
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:41,470
and understood so demand is only gonna

481
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:43,209
start to skyrocket but the biggest thing

482
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:46,210
that we have to do in any of your

483
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:47,800
markets is dr. education and that's not

484
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,290
just saying like I took this product and

485
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:52,389
now my cancer is gone it cured my cancer

486
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:54,338
but like medical studies medical trials

487
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:57,100
like sort of continuing medical

488
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:59,140
education if you educate the doctors and

489
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,300
you keep this patient focused those are

490
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:02,830
the programs that work programs that

491
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:03,969
don't work like Macedonia or others so

492
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,490
we'll talk about that are good that

493
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,860
could be a lot better they didn't focus

494
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:10,480
on the medical patient demand or doctors

495
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:12,759
and actually if you want to have an

496
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,860
international program you must be

497
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:16,509
compliant in your country for what you

498
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:18,429
want to do and for the countries that

499
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:20,140
you're exporting to so if you for

500
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:22,449
example want to be a mass producer in

501
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:24,189
Sri Lanka with some pilot program but

502
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:26,470
not actually allow medical cannabis for

503
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:27,640
people in Sri Lanka Sri Lanka you're not

504
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,890
compliant with the UN Single Convention

505
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,240
like the single convention 1961

506
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,490
psychotropic substances the

507
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,559
International bedrock of medical

508
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,450
cannabis that's your doctrine if you're

509
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:38,589
actually in this industry and the

510
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,660
changes that we're going to get into

511
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:42,069
that are happening with that or actually

512
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,570
the secret roadmap to

513
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:45,189
how this whole industry is gonna unfold

514
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:47,079
in the next three to five years after

515
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,180
that you're gonna be buying shares of

516
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:50,980
like Amazon for a thousand like so it's

517
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,750
like this next period is the only time

518
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,750
that matters in the startup part and

519
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:57,519
this is one of the key secrets to it so

520
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,930
when the world health organization for

521
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,269
the people that were at the UN and like

522
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:02,830
November December it was just hilarious

523
00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:04,720
they had this big report they worked on

524
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:06,159
forever and they're like they did their

525
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,009
big meeting and like the last couple

526
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,630
minutes like and the cannabis part like

527
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:12,789
yeah we've reviewed it we're just not

528
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:15,550
comfortable releasing our results right

529
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:17,409
now and then they like drop the mic and

530
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:17,919
left so it's like okay what did that

531
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,120
mean

532
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,730
now we've understood that they're

533
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:24,879
actually calling for like a rescheduling

534
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:27,099
so by the UN not adopting this in March

535
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,960
like we thought might happen when this

536
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:30,519
happens we go from like every single

537
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,789
country in the single convention like

538
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:37,509
168 from having the ability to do these

539
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:40,539
trade programs to mandatorily having to

540
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:42,670
provide medical cannabis or products to

541
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:44,710
patients in their country if a doctor

542
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:46,480
writes a prescription so I've got

543
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:48,430
offtake agreements with 14 countries

544
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,750
bedrock ends got 19 currently and

545
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:54,190
everyone talks about their exclusives

546
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:59,259
but to go from like 14 to 20 potential

547
00:18:54,190 --> 00:19:00,730
clients let's say to 168 mandatory do

548
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:02,289
you think every single country in that

549
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,360
program is gonna say hey let's start a

550
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:05,950
cannabis production company or program

551
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:07,269
and regulate it and understand this or

552
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,920
they're gonna be like hey we should just

553
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:11,079
buy pharmaceutical products from people

554
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,400
who produce them but that's not gonna be

555
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:15,970
from Canada because they're breaking

556
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,140
international law so when the incb when

557
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,150
they did their report they're always a

558
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,440
year behind it's like they call us the

559
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,480
stoners and slow but it takes them a

560
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,940
year to publish their report late the

561
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,710
2018 report that's the current one now

562
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,230
pretty much says like who's naughty

563
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:30,430
who's nice like Santa Claus list so when

564
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,950
you're looking at investments in

565
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:34,630
potential market risks that's the also

566
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:36,549
the secretive like who is a good country

567
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:39,760
to do this from and the secret from this

568
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:41,069
report also is that legalizing medical

569
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:44,009
cannabis no problem

570
00:19:41,069 --> 00:19:46,899
legalizing for recreational purposes

571
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:49,269
very big problem that Convention says

572
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,950
you can't do that so the moment that you

573
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:52,990
legalize recreational cannabis you

574
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:54,720
essentially void yourself from being a

575
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,460
big international player

576
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,720
in the medical cannibis pharmaceutical

577
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,759
industry and now currently yeah we've

578
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,170
got Canada doing some of that but it's

579
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,930
only because they were the only people

580
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:06,300
that had enough supply under even their

581
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:09,269
GPP crappy Canadian standards no offence

582
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:11,430
which Germany was allowing because they

583
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:13,740
didn't have enough supply for their

584
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:15,060
patients from lakebed ricchan which was

585
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,920
right there and then better cans a whole

586
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:19,619
nother story that I mean we don't have

587
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,940
time for currently so just to kind of

588
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:22,589
move forward a little bit quickly like

589
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,660
there's medical cannabis

590
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:27,209
there's recreational cannabis there's

591
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:30,090
hemp it's all the same they're all a dog

592
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:31,920
it's one species like biology degrees

593
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:36,209
like biological definition of a species

594
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:38,550
anybody know science quiz the ability to

595
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:40,620
make sexually viable offspring so if I

596
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:42,809
take like this dog and make this dog

597
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:45,000
that dog can make more dogs and it'll be

598
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:46,799
half and half but the only difference

599
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,230
between dogs just like we've done is we

600
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,700
bred them for specific needs over tens

601
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,779
of thousands of years from like we took

602
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,519
a wolf and we're like this thing's

603
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:55,740
helpful now we've got like little itty

604
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,450
bitty dogs and Great Danes hemp is like

605
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,509
our Great Dane but the reason that we

606
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:02,370
bred it that way for like paper fiber

607
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:04,289
like protein sources but it wasn't like

608
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:06,359
the one that was really fun but then we

609
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:07,950
bred this other type variety but it's

610
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,799
still the same species and the only

611
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:13,350
definition of this or change is just THC

612
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:16,349
which should be THC a which like some

613
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:18,149
countries or 0.2 percent 0.3 0.4 or 1%

614
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:20,490
Switzerland you rock on having that

615
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,110
higher standard here which is really

616
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:24,359
nice but know that this is a type of

617
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:26,879
license medical cannabis is another type

618
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:30,179
of licensed recreational another type

619
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,880
but the risk profile recreational huge

620
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:35,039
risk profile medical here and then hemp

621
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,330
much much lower we planted one of the

622
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,119
first time crops legally in the United

623
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:40,319
States in 2014 under the farm bill it's

624
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:41,909
the first time some of these growers

625
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:43,109
that had ever seen a cannabis plant

626
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:45,000
growing outside and they're like why

627
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:46,619
have we been growing this indoors for so

628
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,750
many years because it was [ __ ]

629
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:52,169
illegal and we had to hide thank you

630
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:53,880
that but we weren't meant like to grow

631
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,890
this plant in warehouses under

632
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,720
streetlights which until give ITA's and

633
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,520
like digital bulbs digital it was street

634
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,230
lights we were growing under like that's

635
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,730
how I got into this my care provider I

636
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,140
saw how he was growing plans in his

637
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,519
basement this medical plant that really

638
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,920
helped me I'm like you're and you're a

639
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:10,019
joke like dangerous past

640
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,180
it's like that's where this industry

641
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:13,920
when I say its agriculture this will get

642
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,500
to three cents on the dollar like corn

643
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,180
or soybeans or other things the only way

644
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,339
to like get that value add is like if

645
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,560
you're growing corn and making corn

646
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,209
syrup like and then like having

647
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,159
distribution there but if you're just a

648
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:28,289
farmer alone without like strategic

649
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,240
partnerships price is gonna keep coming

650
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:31,980
down big outdoor plots are gonna keep

651
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,990
happening so we have to think about

652
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,370
those but like I said yeah bulldog [ __ ]

653
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:37,259
so you get some [ __ ] so you never

654
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:39,629
take like hemp and breed it with

655
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:41,039
cannabis but now we do because we found

656
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:43,080
so many different cannabinoids in

657
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,889
certain varieties of ham flick and get

658
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:49,349
for cba CBG for example or cbn like

659
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:50,580
60,000 and 90,000 a kilo like for that

660
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:53,519
and everyone's talking about CBD which

661
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:55,949
is great but 95% of the CBD and industry

662
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,329
internationally is completely bogus like

663
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,890
even some of the things in switzerland

664
00:22:57,329 --> 00:23:01,019
no offense like kind of are bogus too

665
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:03,060
but there are some very bonafide

666
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:05,009
companies and a very important like

667
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:07,619
cannabinoid out of hundred plus that we

668
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:10,049
know but there's more than just CBD from

669
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:11,879
hemp that you can do and long-term this

670
00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:14,220
sector like from hemp creep and clothing

671
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,600
and protein like huge sector that people

672
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,730
are barely beginning and to understand

673
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:20,250
it was too expensive in the u.s. we had

674
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:22,559
like a quarter billion lacking of like d

675
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:24,960
quarters or combines or how to like

676
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,419
plant tons and tons of clones in a field

677
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,160
like strawberries so when this this

678
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,450
sector starts to change hemp not just

679
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,400
from the cannabinoid extraction

680
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:34,410
standpoint it's gonna be huge as well so

681
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,290
we always go from one sector to invest

682
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:38,430
into the other but you need this in the

683
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:41,069
bigger picture for your investment

684
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:42,630
portfolios the piece with like

685
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:44,099
switzerland has been so good you look at

686
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,870
all these companies doing this and then

687
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:47,819
spain freaked out the UK freaked out

688
00:23:45,869 --> 00:23:49,429
like this we don't have to be novel food

689
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:52,799
because like we had food products before

690
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:55,170
1996 but CBD is not a hundred percent

691
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,639
legal like everyone thinks everyone just

692
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:58,140
goes around thinking like it's legal and

693
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,500
they legalize it in the united states in

694
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,970
the farm bill 2014 2018 I can cross

695
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,589
state lines why are some eyes being

696
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:07,529
pulled over and people put in jail for

697
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:09,629
like hemp biomass because there's not

698
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,519
understanding and people don't have high

699
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,920
pressure liquid chromatography

700
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:15,900
instruments to like test like things but

701
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,090
if you're going to do the international

702
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,470
CBD and hemp policy part I know some

703
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,939
people have mentioned novel foods which

704
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,799
I've got a slide on

705
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,700
one of the most important things for you

706
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,470
if you're doing non psychoactive

707
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,259
products but if you don't have one of

708
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:30,480
those 69 licenses in the world to do it

709
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:33,029
you're in a you're in a world of hurt

710
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,279
right now the FDA is kind of like the

711
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:37,500
gold seal for at least like we're an

712
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,819
import market is for pharmaceutical if

713
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,109
you want to make a pharmaceutical

714
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:42,629
product you're anywhere from ten to

715
00:24:40,109 --> 00:24:45,179
eleven years from like idea to pharmacy

716
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:47,310
shelf so cannabis is no different but

717
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:49,950
right now internationally you have

718
00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:51,629
medical cannabis flower and then oil and

719
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,400
then the compounding is happening in

720
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:55,350
pharmacies I can't sell transdermal

721
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,360
patches I can't sell vape cartridges or

722
00:24:55,349 --> 00:24:59,309
nasal sprays because those have to go

723
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,559
through drug discovery and clinical

724
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:03,720
trials and product registrations

725
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:06,240
so if you are a company doing like the

726
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,009
medical or the recreational side you

727
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,529
have to think like long-term this is

728
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:12,299
going to take more time than you think

729
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:13,710
epidemics GW Pharmaceuticals years and

730
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:16,529
years and years but look at their stock

731
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:17,970
now for even having one product with two

732
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:20,399
point five percent two point five

733
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:22,170
percent or two point five milligrams two

734
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,300
point five milligrams it's five

735
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:26,730
milligrams like of cannabinoids in a

736
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:28,019
dose 36,000 a year for that product in

737
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,610
the United States which is complete

738
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:31,710
[ __ ] because kids with epilepsy

739
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:33,089
shouldn't have to their parents

740
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,980
shouldn't have to pay such premiums on

741
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:37,199
this so these companies do get to bring

742
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,670
medicine to the world but the companies

743
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,559
that are starting to look at how to work

744
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:42,870
towards getting drug approval in the

745
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,099
u.s. drug approval in other countries

746
00:25:42,869 --> 00:25:46,469
first where it's cheaper and easier

747
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:47,759
South Africa Israel I mean there's four

748
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,299
or five that we work in for drug

749
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:50,819
discovery

750
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:52,829
that's the crown jewel for exits for

751
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:53,939
drug discovery and how often do we find

752
00:25:52,829 --> 00:25:55,500
some new thing that we can make

753
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,870
pharmaceutical drugs that change the

754
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,940
world that have hardly any side effects

755
00:25:57,869 --> 00:26:01,139
compared to what we typically use but

756
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,330
this is what you should be shooting for

757
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,770
from an international side this is like

758
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:07,109
my favorite I always talk about this

759
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:09,029
because and we've worked now in nineteen

760
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:10,919
countries like with licensed work and

761
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:14,160
this game like if you played it as a kid

762
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,450
it's always like you start and it's open

763
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,670
and like you put your little pieces

764
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:19,710
around and you only get to do this once

765
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:21,330
after you go around and all the little

766
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:23,579
places have their like then you just

767
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:25,500
fight and right now new countries are

768
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:26,789
opening up new opportunities and that's

769
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,650
where like where are you planting your

770
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:30,690
flag and how many Flags can you plant at

771
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:32,280
a time you can't be like Tillery trying

772
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:34,410
to take over the world or canopy thing

773
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:35,819
can you can just raise cheap capital

774
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:37,140
here and then deployed around the world

775
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:38,970
well back home you're breaking

776
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,070
international law it's gonna be a big

777
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:42,839
problem but if you have something good

778
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:45,539
it always takes the local team in the

779
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:47,579
local market to be successful anytime I

780
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:48,930
see the big Canadian strategies of going

781
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:49,859
to take over the world it's not

782
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,660
successful

783
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:53,339
there's always local problems and

784
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,259
challenges so like if you have a product

785
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:58,529
if you have a company a team a license

786
00:26:55,259 --> 00:27:00,299
in a unique place what do you have what

787
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:02,220
do you need find your right partnerships

788
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:04,200
and do it but that's what we look for

789
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,640
for an investment basis like that good

790
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,470
team in a market with some sort of

791
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,990
unique advantage and they're hard to

792
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:12,809
find that's why we work all over the

793
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:14,370
world to find these you use kind of huge

794
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:14,730
deal I know we're not technically in it

795
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:17,069
right now

796
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:18,799
little province here but the EU is like

797
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:21,419
a crown jewel for what's going to be

798
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,279
required from like a standard standpoint

799
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,960
from around the world with the amount of

800
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,529
companies and countries that are in the

801
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,990
EU

802
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:29,970
there's only one that actually matters I

803
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:32,069
mean Germany is like setting standards

804
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:33,930
with the bee farm but it's like it's

805
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:35,250
Germany I know it's pretty close but

806
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:37,259
like it's kind of a [ __ ] crazy

807
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:39,480
program and it's gonna take a lot longer

808
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:41,099
than they think but for even how much is

809
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,200
happening in the EU what's beautiful

810
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:45,149
about the EU is when you are a country

811
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,289
in the EU and you get a drug product

812
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:50,100
registered you're the same everywhere

813
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:51,899
Canadian companies trying to make

814
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:54,569
products you have to go to every company

815
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,490
every country get approval go through

816
00:27:54,569 --> 00:27:58,439
all this [ __ ] all these testing all

817
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:00,000
these inspections it's expensive it

818
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,190
takes a lot of time and sometimes it

819
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,069
doesn't happen you produce a product in

820
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:06,600
the EU you're good to go and which

821
00:28:05,069 --> 00:28:11,549
countries in the EU are actually

822
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:13,889
allowing production Portugal yeah big

823
00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:17,789
fan I live there now for a reason

824
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:19,530
go 200 yeah well that was the first

825
00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:21,809
tinder the second tinder is a little bit

826
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:24,480
better but still complete [ __ ] so we

827
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:26,220
got Germany which sucks Portugal which

828
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,730
is amazing but almost impossible to

829
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:31,049
operate Greece well okay well we're

830
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:32,370
gonna have some slides on Cyprus and

831
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:34,230
Malta but like Greece is the one that

832
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:37,259
people talk about problem with Greece

833
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:39,920
though is that they'd be that's I'm the

834
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:39,920
unprofessional one

835
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:49,619
I'm promised I'm not gonna take that

836
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:51,000
call Greece copied a lot of Israeli laws

837
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:52,918
that then made their standard deviation

838
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,298
pretty much zero but one problem with

839
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:56,909
Greece and like my parents live there

840
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:59,730
love it have been there Greece is in the

841
00:28:56,909 --> 00:29:03,509
EU but it's like not like a favorable

842
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:05,788
position or viewed like just kind of

843
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:07,259
like like Italy like corruption business

844
00:29:05,788 --> 00:29:09,240
kind of some weird things like a lot of

845
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:10,679
companies and countries in the EU are

846
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,960
just concerned on working with Greece

847
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:13,919
cannabis companies and programs same

848
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,750
thing we're seeing four companies

849
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,250
outside of it like Macedonia with like

850
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,648
illegal shipments from one place to

851
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,839
another to pull into then Germany like

852
00:29:19,648 --> 00:29:23,189
those things once your company gets bad

853
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:26,189
credibility for something in their

854
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:27,409
program you're toxic because this is

855
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:29,399
about like international pharmaceutical

856
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:31,139
regulations so even though Greece is in

857
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:32,158
the EU if they make a couple changes to

858
00:29:31,138 --> 00:29:34,288
their program it could be very very

859
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,730
bonafide but there's a reason I didn't

860
00:29:34,288 --> 00:29:37,200
go after like like to Coombe and others

861
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:40,048
they went after those first licenses

862
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,399
climates good labor understood but also

863
00:29:40,048 --> 00:29:44,298
just like Colombia which we'll get into

864
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:46,378
which has massive opportunities but

865
00:29:44,298 --> 00:29:48,000
eighty-five ninety percent of what will

866
00:29:46,378 --> 00:29:50,219
happen in Colombia is complete garbage

867
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,308
as well because it's not compliant on an

868
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,480
international basis so EU by them

869
00:29:53,308 --> 00:29:56,970
actually saying like we're gonna like

870
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,919
change this kind of be a leader Canada

871
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:01,200
thought they were they're not the United

872
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:03,629
States obviously we're like light years

873
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,490
behind what could happen here you will

874
00:30:03,628 --> 00:30:07,798
see major pharmaceutical development of

875
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:09,899
cannabis and cannabis products in the

876
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:11,460
European Union based on testing

877
00:30:09,898 --> 00:30:12,750
standards and regulations that then the

878
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,298
intellectual property will be owned

879
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:17,009
brand license around the world but when

880
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:18,148
there's only a few company of countries

881
00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:20,308
that actually allow this to happen

882
00:30:18,148 --> 00:30:22,018
that's where the focus needs to be but

883
00:30:20,308 --> 00:30:23,490
the only ones that do our hardest hell

884
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:25,740
or then you have like the Denmark side

885
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,419
that's just a pilot program very very

886
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,220
short term so you also have to think

887
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:31,409
where your positioning what you're using

888
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:33,659
that position for for the next step and

889
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:35,120
not just get like run over just like you

890
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:37,350
did in Canada

891
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:39,000
so by rescheduling in the

892
00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:40,980
reclassification of CBD they set

893
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,599
international policy which is going to

894
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,009
change the game which is allowing so

895
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:45,359
much of what's going to be great out of

896
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:47,278
Switzerland pure and some of the others

897
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:48,959
to happen but also they'll probably be

898
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,970
six seven hundred producers here that

899
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,528
have no market or no opportunity because

900
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:54,509
they're not producing at a compliant

901
00:30:52,528 --> 00:30:55,630
standards level so a lot of Swiss

902
00:30:54,509 --> 00:30:58,059
investments are going to be

903
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:59,680
complete garbage and waste the time like

904
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:01,450
kind of like smoking bad hemp it gives

905
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,080
you a headache the same thing with bad

906
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:06,460
CBD companies very very similar

907
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:08,740
Germany's like our crown jewel speed up

908
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:10,329
a little bit to go faster major problem

909
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,950
though with this program the doctor

910
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:13,480
education piece when you think of they

911
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:15,340
didn't even know kind of like California

912
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,890
how many patients how many products but

913
00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:19,839
Germany for an import market is the gold

914
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:21,910
standard that everyone wants for offtake

915
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:23,889
agreements but there's seven main key

916
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:25,900
players there that control that piece so

917
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:27,310
if you're in with them you're very very

918
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,170
good but the secret with the German

919
00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:31,450
program the first tender which now is my

920
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:33,759
model internationally if I meet the

921
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:35,610
standard that they set and I'm the

922
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:38,890
lowest price I win

923
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:40,329
so volume over margin every single day

924
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,800
in cannabis and be willing to have a

925
00:31:40,329 --> 00:31:43,750
lower margin in the beginning to just

926
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:45,519
undercut your competitors to take the

927
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:48,309
whole market share but it's not about a

928
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,379
brand it's not about are you the

929
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:52,480
standard are you the lowest price you

930
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:54,880
win and I'd rather be the generic of

931
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,559
Viagra than viagra any day because after

932
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,300
like the first drugs come out like the

933
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,089
advertising wears off generic is where

934
00:31:58,299 --> 00:32:02,950
it all goes what we've seen though is

935
00:32:01,089 --> 00:32:04,539
it's so low the amount of prescriptions

936
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:06,309
happening because there's not enough

937
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:08,470
doctors that understand cannabis and

938
00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:10,329
they only allow smokeable flour and oils

939
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:12,870
that have to be compounded once

940
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:15,279
Germany's allowing product registrations

941
00:32:12,869 --> 00:32:16,959
game-changer that's when like some of

942
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,389
the new German licenses for contract

943
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,819
manufacturing partnerships that's where

944
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:23,020
all invest into [ __ ] investing into

945
00:32:21,819 --> 00:32:24,700
growing cannabis in Germany it's

946
00:32:23,019 --> 00:32:27,670
expensive their VAT is crazy their

947
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:29,140
climates not that good I mean you look

948
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:30,700
at Portugal's probably still a tenth of

949
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:33,280
the cost of Germany and they're both in

950
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,569
the EU I mean there's a reason I have a

951
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,779
ten because there's a lot of Sun in

952
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:39,460
Portugal so it's been two years we look

953
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:41,349
at like all the bids all the things that

954
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:43,000
happened all the Canadian companies that

955
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:44,500
like tried to partner they're over a

956
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,809
hundred million euros spent on that

957
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:49,269
first tinder process that went nowhere

958
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:51,429
the second tinder process is a joke upon

959
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:53,619
a joke but if I don't apply for a

960
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:56,140
license with a team in a market there's

961
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:57,939
a reason and we did not apply for one of

962
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,470
these licenses and a lot of people did

963
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,029
and there's a lot of opportunity but

964
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:03,370
it's not going to be a world leader for

965
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:06,149
massive cultivation innovation

966
00:33:03,369 --> 00:33:09,099
technology and drug discovery yes

967
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,620
Switzerland love it I mean I'd like the

968
00:33:09,099 --> 00:33:11,538
Joker

969
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:14,959
like Belgium but I'm not gonna say it

970
00:33:11,538 --> 00:33:16,940
about chocolate and child abuse but what

971
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,038
I've seen was Switzerland with this 1%

972
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,730
it's changed the game because outside of

973
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:22,538
Switzerland

974
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:27,940
how many hemp varieties are allowed

975
00:33:22,538 --> 00:33:31,429
anyone know outside of Switzerland like

976
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:32,960
- there's two varieties like hemp

977
00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:34,460
varieties like the European Commission

978
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,140
that it's like kind of classified and

979
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,730
they're crap it's the same thing with

980
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:39,470
like Bedrich and having five varieties

981
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:41,839
when you're curtailed on genetics you're

982
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:43,579
screwed you didn't have that here the

983
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:45,230
breeding the research and development I

984
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:47,298
mean some of the tours I'll do tomorrow

985
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:48,950
I just have to figure out still Shang

986
00:33:47,298 --> 00:33:50,658
than profits like how to actually export

987
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,190
genetics legally based on some of the

988
00:33:50,659 --> 00:33:53,840
R&amp;D here because it's been incredible

989
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:55,548
with what some of the Swiss have done

990
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:57,678
but yeah five six hundred of those will

991
00:33:55,548 --> 00:33:59,538
not protect that correctly and get these

992
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,278
to the world market if that's what

993
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:03,558
you're trying to do compliance first

994
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:05,450
that'll be the key to it the problem is

995
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:06,918
that you will have this hemp CBD side

996
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:09,409
but your medical cannabis program is

997
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:11,628
garbage as well so like know that by

998
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:13,809
using this like Lobby and push for the

999
00:34:11,628 --> 00:34:16,098
next position because that's where the

1000
00:34:13,809 --> 00:34:18,500
huge revenue potential and the non

1001
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:19,730
psychoactive CBD side very very good but

1002
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,159
medical cannabis they're suffering

1003
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:23,990
patients here that need it use this

1004
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,260
policy to kind of move forward with the

1005
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:29,539
Swiss program what was kind of amazing

1006
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:31,210
in like actually the stances that

1007
00:34:29,539 --> 00:34:33,259
they've had Switzerland I do

1008
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:35,570
wholeheartedly believe I thought Poland

1009
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,629
Switzerland Austria from like ahem side

1010
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:39,859
Italy kinda like the Greece thing like

1011
00:34:37,628 --> 00:34:41,659
the this is like one of the key

1012
00:34:39,858 --> 00:34:44,029
countries and in Europe and in the world

1013
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:45,679
for like non psychoactive CBD hemp and

1014
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,580
the legislation the policies it'll

1015
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,050
happen there'll be some great

1016
00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:50,659
investments here but know that like

1017
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:52,339
ninety out of every hundred computer

1018
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:54,829
crap so you have to be very very careful

1019
00:34:52,338 --> 00:34:56,329
with your due diligence Austria like

1020
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:58,400
their medical program complete garbage

1021
00:34:56,329 --> 00:35:00,769
I'm side looking very very favorable

1022
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,240
with what's going on there nothing in

1023
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:04,250
comparison though to what you can do

1024
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:06,019
here in Switzerland so strategic

1025
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,880
partnerships here with Swiss companies

1026
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:09,469
doing this correctly just like you saw

1027
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,510
some press releases in public news this

1028
00:35:09,469 --> 00:35:14,209
last week will be very very paramount

1029
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:16,869
for creating some huge valuations public

1030
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:19,070
and private in this next quarter

1031
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:20,250
Canada's a piece of [ __ ] I hate this

1032
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:22,500
place

1033
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:23,909
I'm sorry I just I know I don't have

1034
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,940
that one slide about the eagle and then

1035
00:35:23,909 --> 00:35:29,009
but Canada essentially great medical

1036
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:31,019
program initially get medicine to

1037
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:33,510
patients when they legalized their

1038
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:35,099
medical program as a country in a g8

1039
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:37,410
that's what allowed the public markets

1040
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:39,210
to happen but so many fraudulent public

1041
00:35:37,409 --> 00:35:41,699
companies have hurt now cannabis and

1042
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:43,619
then like raising capital easily going

1043
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:46,348
and scheduling around the world Canada

1044
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:48,720
has hurt medical patients like worldwide

1045
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:50,550
why is tilray only making 23 million in

1046
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:51,689
revenue and a quarter when we have like

1047
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:53,010
California companies doing that

1048
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:54,780
practically a month

1049
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:56,190
but they're like they're tilray why is

1050
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,599
like so you have to look at some of

1051
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:59,940
these public valuations and what's

1052
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,650
actually happening and what's unique but

1053
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:04,230
with Canada being the first to do this

1054
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:05,670
it gave them major market position but

1055
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:07,590
just like Bruce and others have seen we

1056
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:09,840
have to divest of certain positions we

1057
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:11,039
have to acquire and do major mergers and

1058
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,130
acquisitions with this but it's not

1059
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:16,050
happening fast enough and as oversupply

1060
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,970
is happening in Canada there's like 700

1061
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:19,920
new companies being built as we speak

1062
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:22,769
construction to grow more cannabis in an

1063
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,960
already flooded market but Canada based

1064
00:36:22,769 --> 00:36:26,730
on breaking international law for

1065
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,260
legalizing reckon you're equated to but

1066
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:30,389
no one like cares about that program

1067
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,630
very much compared to Canada for a

1068
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:34,858
reason no offence Uruguay is what's

1069
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,390
gonna happen then by them breaking

1070
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:37,949
international law Germany and other

1071
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:39,779
countries are not going to allow their

1072
00:36:37,949 --> 00:36:41,879
medical imports once there's enough

1073
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,369
certified compliance supply from other

1074
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,510
producers aka Portugal or Denmark or

1075
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:47,940
some of these other countries or

1076
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:49,440
Colombia with the non-psychoactive so

1077
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,789
they have a very limited window where

1078
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,679
they're taking over the world no one's

1079
00:36:50,789 --> 00:36:54,690
gonna be able to buy their supply in the

1080
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:56,848
future though the other supply then that

1081
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:59,608
will all be in Canada massive facilities

1082
00:36:56,849 --> 00:37:01,559
I mean a price for a gram what 10 cents

1083
00:36:59,608 --> 00:37:04,500
maybe someday it's gonna be amazing but

1084
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:06,000
like that whole stock side very few of

1085
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,588
those are gonna survive because they

1086
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,010
didn't get into other markets quickly

1087
00:37:07,588 --> 00:37:09,420
enough

1088
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:13,010
they used it at first but then they

1089
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:14,940
entrenched too deeply the market evolved

1090
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:16,710
when you look at all the companies that

1091
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,720
are listed and how many are gonna be

1092
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:21,030
delisted or when they're raising capital

1093
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:23,219
in Canada to then invest into the United

1094
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,750
States or other programs or allowing

1095
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:26,250
foreign nationals to invest into

1096
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:28,170
something federally illegal in the

1097
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:30,869
United States and facilitating it as a

1098
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:32,220
public vehicle problems that's why I

1099
00:37:30,869 --> 00:37:33,660
know I won't have much more time but

1100
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:35,250
with Israel

1101
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:37,529
the companies that got to list some very

1102
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:39,568
good public companies but now why do we

1103
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:41,730
have 40 new Israeli companies listing in

1104
00:37:39,568 --> 00:37:43,079
in Australia because they're all trying

1105
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:44,699
to do the same thing but the Israeli

1106
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:46,410
exchange tel-aviv exchange pretty much

1107
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:47,939
said like we cannot allow what happened

1108
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:51,480
in Canada to happen with our medical

1109
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,740
program boom I always kind of like like

1110
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,630
to make fun of tilray for a lot of

1111
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:56,338
reasons but it's not just about the

1112
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,960
money like you have to think about this

1113
00:37:56,338 --> 00:37:59,608
industry and what we're able to do with

1114
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,068
these companies and products like for

1115
00:37:59,608 --> 00:38:03,630
changing people's lives and it's this is

1116
00:38:02,068 --> 00:38:05,759
like that kind of hard moment if we only

1117
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:07,608
have so much time to do this and there's

1118
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,260
a lot of [ __ ] and a lot of [ __ ]

1119
00:38:07,608 --> 00:38:12,358
using this very very special sacred

1120
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:14,220
plant to just pump and dump stock

1121
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:15,210
valuations to like buy Maseratis and

1122
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:17,129
that's [ __ ]

1123
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,510
like we've seen it like raising capital

1124
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,650
is hard the first couple hundred million

1125
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:21,809
we raised I thought it would take

1126
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:23,010
forever now internationally it seems

1127
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:24,780
like it's so much easier because

1128
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:26,789
international pharmaceutical drug

1129
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:28,410
discovery you realize you've got one

1130
00:38:26,789 --> 00:38:29,940
moment to do this and it takes a lot of

1131
00:38:28,409 --> 00:38:32,730
capital and raising capital is

1132
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,530
challenging so everyone just lists does

1133
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:35,429
some press releases and thinks that you

1134
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:37,740
know they're going to be able to then

1135
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:39,868
make these different positions but it's

1136
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:41,818
not like Silicon Valley private

1137
00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:43,559
companies private investments scaling

1138
00:38:41,818 --> 00:38:45,480
and positioning correctly will be more

1139
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:47,430
powerful than the public markets on this

1140
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,108
side and public does have an advantage

1141
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:51,778
for a lot of our portfolios for their

1142
00:38:49,108 --> 00:38:54,719
exits but I always loved those Series A

1143
00:38:51,778 --> 00:38:57,539
Series B positions early on in cannabis

1144
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:59,368
but just know if you do list and that

1145
00:38:57,539 --> 00:39:01,680
whole sector has a change even if you're

1146
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:04,230
a great company you're pulled down with

1147
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:05,038
it like why can't I get any shares too

1148
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:07,500
short tilray

1149
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:09,150
or why do I have to pay 25 to 30% carry

1150
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,949
just to get shares to borrow to short

1151
