7
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:18,320
together we had a great show yesterday i

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,160
believe

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,320
all of us been around it's an absolute

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,480
pleasure to talk a bit more about adult

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,839
use cannabis legalization models across

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,000
europe today

13
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,559
and my name is luke richner i'm from

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,119
switzerland i'm here to represent kind

15
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:35,280
of iggy but also to represent a bit the

16
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,320
swiss industry and some of the parts and

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,719
the

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,000
approach that we're having towards this

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,200
legalization

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,480
if we can call it at that already and

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,399
what do we do

22
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:49,759
kind of video is a compliance track and

23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,679
trace software see to sale inspired by

24
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,679
what the us is doing

25
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,920
i believe you had metric earlier today

26
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,000
being one of the first in the industry

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,480
and we then looked at what canada is

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,399
doing with the gs1 integration with a

29
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,878
more standardized global approach in the

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,680
supply chain and we looked at different

31
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,920
standards out there looking at the ugmp

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,040
more consumer protection consumer safety

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,680
aspects

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,360
and and out of all of that we created a

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,520
new new

36
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,280
aspect a new basis of a software that

37
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,118
kind of taps into all those different

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,960
standards and

39
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,719
we're very proud to say that we were

40
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,798
able to secure a 10-year contract with

41
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,719
the swiss health ministry for the whole

42
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,320
track and trace of those pilot projects

43
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,719
the legalization models that i'll share

44
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,399
a little bit more about later but i

45
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,519
think that's enough about me to start

46
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,118
let's have everybody introduce

47
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,359

and we deliver basically turkey projects

95
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,360
from

96
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,599
an idea from an investor to get the full

97
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,120
deployment of the project and the

98

we're happy i'm happy to to be here and

101
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:43,598
to discuss about the the adult use

102
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,599
models in here in europe thank you

103
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,280
thank you guys and basically what we

104
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,639
want to discuss a little bit today i

105
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,000
mean you've heard all about what is

106
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,598
happening in different countries we're

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,919
not going to go too deep into those

108
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,759
different models it's all over a similar

109
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,000
thing and but we'll do a little

110
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:00,079
introduction of just overarching what is

111
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
happening in the respective countries

112
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,319
and then bring that a bit closer

113
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,318
together and give some aspects where we

114
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:09,119
think uh maybe there could be a little

115
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:11,679
bit more thought process put into into

116
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,680
some of those

117
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,399
some of some of that momentum let's call

118
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,478
it like that uh maybe i'll kick it off

119
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,719
with switzerland uh what we're doing

120
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,079
right now we're in basically in a

121
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,960
consultation

122
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,439
mode consultation situation we call it a

123
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,239
pilot project it's basically a

124
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:33,040
nationwide study on how legalization can

125
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,879
be formulated so instead of having five

126
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,600
sessions and one of them being open we

127
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,600
do five years that can be cut short but

128
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,000
we have a five plus five year period

129
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,919
where anyone that would like to show and

130
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,918
think through a way of legalization they

131
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,599
can submit that you have to submit that

132
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,359
to the health ministry then you're going

133
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,680
to have all different participants of

134
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,439
the supply chain every stakeholder

135
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,959
involved and

136
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,000
through that after that through the

137
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:02,399
basis of hard data we then formulate a

138
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,199
basis for for a legal structure so uh i

139
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,799
think

140
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,120
what i think we'll talk more about later

141
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,720
in a little bit but why don't i give it

142
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,199
back into the round and share a bit more

143
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,680
about how it's how it's approached in

144
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,720
your area

145
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,639
so

146
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,360
we heard a lot about germany yesterday

147
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,038
already um i think we're

148
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,439
unlikely a few steps behind the

149
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,439
switzerland and germany we're trying to

150
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:28,879
find our way still

151
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:30,560
how can we make recreational cannabis

152
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,360
accessible to

153
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,959
um yeah to the people in germany it's

154
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,319
not defined yet

155
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,478
would it be through pharmacies whether

156
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,599
it be through dispensaries will it will

157
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,478
we even allow to grow plants at home

158
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,160
um

159
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,639
which to my personal opinion would be

160
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,160
great as a as a grower that has access

161
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,319
to a lot of knowledge

162
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,320
people like sonia could help me grow

163
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,319
grow plants but i think in general it's

164
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,279
a

165
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,038
yeah

166
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,439
it's a difficult thing to grow cannabis

167
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,560
the right way so i'm not sure if i would

168
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,719
allow to

169
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,879
for everybody to grow at home

170
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,800
but this process just was kicked off

171
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,639
we're hoping to get it to parliament

172
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,800
next year beginning of next year and

173
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,918
maybe have a decision end of the year so

174
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,520
we're still finding our way in germany

175
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:16,560
and and i think it's going to be an

176
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,240
exciting

177
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,439
path and we

178
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,918
have some kind of obligation to make

179
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,240
sure it goes or to bring our input as

180
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,799
insights from the industry to all the

181
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,280
politics everybody who has a say on that

182
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,038
so we can make sure it's it's going the

183
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:36,239
right way and looking left and right i

184
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:38,240
think is a good idea um because

185
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,079
maybe sony we want to take it up next

186
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,160
for for the netherlands there is another

187
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,359
model that's also interesting let's see

188
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,400
how that will go

189
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,960
yeah indeed it's of course tolerated for

190
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,198
many many years in the netherlands

191
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,560
like the backdoor policy we sometimes

192
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,879
call it

193
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,038
we have that distribution model

194
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,439
already set up for years with the coffee

195
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:03,120
shops and now finally a couple years ago

196
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:05,439
the government decided okay that's also

197
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,079
from the growing side the supply to the

198
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:10,478
coffee shops let's organize that

199
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,560
so they had um yeah like a they call it

200
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:14,079
an experiment a lot of people have

201
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,800
actually no idea why it's called an

202
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:19,279
experiment but that is because of the

203
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,439
single conventional 1961 there are two

204
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,198
exceptions medicinal and scientific

205
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,360
purposes

206
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,199
regarding cannabis and

207
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,520
they the netherlands don't want to be

208
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,598
like uruguay and canada

209
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,159
of course fully legalize it now we want

210
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:37,038
to be a brave kid within europe and okay

211
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,840
we call it an experiment so now

212
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,519
10

213
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:43,119
growers have actually got a permit they

214
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,598
can start

215
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,160
production soon when

216
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,240
actually they know a bit more about the

217
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,000
the timeline when they're gonna supply

218
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,560
the coffee shops

219
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,959
it's actually not all coffee shops so

220
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,560
10 municipalities in the netherlands are

221
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,680
part of the coffee shop

222
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,280
experiment

223
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,280
so it's not the big cities like

224
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,079
amsterdam the hague rotterdam and

225
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:09,038
utrecht now it's smaller like the bigger

226
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:12,000
cities in the south and the east

227
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,839
so the 10 growers can supply the 10

228
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,360
cities and all the coffee shops in there

229
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,359
and there will be a certain moment the

230
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,919
government will say to coffee shops

231
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,120
you're only allowed from now on to buy

232
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:25,680
from those 10 growers and that's a bit

233
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,000
how the experiment is organized

234
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,759
the the drawing as it was actually was

235
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,639
already in the december

236
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,240
2020 and still we have no

237
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:35,360
grower really

238
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,200
active

239
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:42,000
and yeah being able to sell and

240
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,399
last week i was hearing that the growers

241
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,360
themselves are expecting it will be

242
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,399
actually

243
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,200
q4 2023 probably

244
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,240
and

245
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,160
yeah

246
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,839
really looking forward when we finally

247
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:57,919
get there great for greenhouse

248
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,800
cultivation right another q4 to start

249
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,799
i'll

250
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,958
share them with that yeah

251
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,559
so i forgot to mention that portuguese

252
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,838
so um

253
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,159
we

254
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,480
last year we had some movements to

255
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,719
legalize cannabis there was a couple of

256
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,839
parties that submitted some

257
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,680
proposal of law in the parliament

258
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,360
it was not approved it was delayed for

259
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,679
further discussion

260
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,600
and with all of this situation uh with

261
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,679
the war and all of that so basically the

262
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,560
priorities are elsewhere

263
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:31,278
and everyone's expectations were that by

264
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,759
2023 um the general law would be

265
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:36,159
approved obviously

266
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:38,559
despite this general law may be approved

267
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,159
until 2023 and

268
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,559
there's actually no model yet we're

269
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,519
trying to find our way as in the same as

270
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:45,679
germany

271
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,399
and there's always time to

272
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:50,479
operationalize the law so you need to

273
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,639
need to give tools to your to your

274
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,759
police to check that everyone

275
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,240
has the

276
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,759
maximum amount of the limit that you

277
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,278
have when you're driving

278
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,278
there's a number of things that need to

279
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,519
be operationalized so despite the law

280
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:04,879
they came out in 2023

281
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,039
there's a lot of things that need to be

282
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:10,399
done afterwards um specific laws

283
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,439
specific limits to how do you test it

284
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,839
um

285
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,000
and all of this will take my expectation

286
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,279
would take at least two to three years

287
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
to make it actually uh uh available to

288
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:22,958
to to people in general when about spain

289
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,919
yeah

290
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,119
so

291
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,199
yeah we're trying to find our way

292
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,879
there's no there's no yet an idea

293
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,399
complete idea of if it will be through

294
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:35,039
pharmacies if it will be through

295
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,799
dispensaries if there will be a limit to

296
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,240
the number of dispensaries if we go that

297
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,479
way um

298
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,919
that for people to to to open a

299
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,000
dispensary um there's still things to be

300
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,639
done i think across europe it's not just

301
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,159
the portugal spain has a

302
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,480
has already a different model they have

303
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,439
the social clubs that were opened for

304
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,639
um

305
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,560
protecting people that consume drugs so

306
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,720
that's that's one step at least to

307
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,518
protect those people that already have

308
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,360
this

309
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,039
this consumption in place

310
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,600
now they're making movements for the

311
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,519
medical cannabis um

312
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,519
the next step will be the recreational

313
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,120
um let's hope it gets its get there

314
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,399
soon

315
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,879
thank you guys so we heard a little bit

316
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,360
more about the different approaches and

317
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,519
some of the different models and

318
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,360
i think our main part here in the panel

319
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,919
is also to channel challenge that a

320
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,320
little bit and we are in europe here so

321
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,639
we all have seen what happened in other

322
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,040
countries um i don't want to say they're

323
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,039
all failed models but let's say that if

324
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,278
you still have 80

325
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:42,240
black market consumption after five to

326
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:44,320
ten years depending where legalization

327
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,519
then it's not really what we're striving

328
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,680
for in europe

329
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,440
um we also have a different kind of

330
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,679
approach i believe we are the legal

331
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,120
structure first and then business other

332
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,399
countries are business first and then

333
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,799
legal structure

334
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,639
so it's a it's a great time for us to

335
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,519
see to assess what happened around the

336
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,600
world and and bring that into you know

337
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,440
into different formulations of how this

338
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,680
can work actually not different

339
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,000
formulations i think it has to be very

340
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,439
much a harmonized approach and this is

341
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,600
one of the things that i'm very much

342
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,360
missing right now in switzerland it took

343
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,120
us four years we've been consulting with

344
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,519
the with the government the last two and

345
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,278
a half years and we're able to finally

346
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,959
and again yeah it's also a study it's

347
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:25,120
not the full legalization because it

348
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:28,879
doesn't help anyone if you step outside

349
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,720
of the law so you better create a study

350
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,519
environment that allows you to then move

351
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,720
further once everybody else has figured

352
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,720
out their things

353
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,160
but what i'm afraid right now is that

354
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,920
we're going in the same direction like

355
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,519
some of the other countries yeah then we

356
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,199
just go okay business first some of the

357
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,879
big companies here in germany you lobby

358
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,720
in the bank this this and then in the

359
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,360
end you have a legal framework that

360
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,440
works in the short term and if it does

361
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,278
not work in the long term we had in

362
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,800
switzerland 20 years ago we almost

363
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:56,480
legalized and

364
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,799
that was then put on hold for another 20

365
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,959
years because we went too fast into it

366
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,719
now i don't want to say slow things down

367
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,958
and i just want to say you know have a

368
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,639
bit more of a wider approach a bit more

369
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:10,000
look at the different models what we see

370
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,919
also right now right malta multi is a

371
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,839
not-for-profit organization that they're

372
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:16,240
creating that does the whole

373
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,240
a system of malta under one roof and

374
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,120
then disperses the money which is also

375
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,120
one of the workarounds and

376
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,440
with all those different approaches

377
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,039
right now is that's what we discussed

378
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,040
earlier also that

379
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,679
if we do this now how do we then later

380
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,440
come to an actual industry in the end of

381
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,479
the day it's time it's our

382
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,120
the whole

383
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,800
way the european union works it's a

384
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,679
collaborative approach you should have

385
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:47,120
to know we have harmonized laws we have

386
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:48,479
country overarching systems and i see

387
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,679
now different standards right

388
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,879
switzerland the cultivation is under

389
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:57,039
gacp and organic which means soil bound

390
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:59,039
and so forth that was done for several

391
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,559
reasons uh you always want to have the

392
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,480
farm lobby with you you want to have the

393
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:05,119
big lobbies with you so you have to find

394
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,360
a stakeholder harmonized approach

395
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,720
throughout and

396
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,399
this is also one of the things that we

397
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,160
discussed what are the standards that

398
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,320
you think we should have

399
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,000
for like cultivation that side of the

400
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,600
supply chain of the earlier one that you

401
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,679
think would work across those different

402
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,440
jurisdictions

403
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,919
do you want to take this one out i think

404
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,440
it's yeah yeah

405
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,039
so there's

406
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,440
at the moment there's two licensing and

407
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,039
or two two approaches to guidelines to

408
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,519
cultivation

409
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:35,838
or to actually the the product one is

410
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,480
rather produced under gcp and product

411
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,120
produced under gmp

412
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,440
the gmp is applicable to pharmaceutical

413
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,879
standards so it's the approach that was

414
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,199
defined for the medical candidates in

415
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:50,000
europe

416
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:52,479
cultivation is always done under gac

417
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,759
it's the processing that is then

418
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,759
passes through

419
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,958
through gmp

420
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:01,439
for the adult use i would think that

421
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:04,399
probably gcp would be

422
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,279
would be more than enough to

423
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:10,078
to assure that we have a product that is

424
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:12,240
safe for the consumer

425
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,000
for the pharmaceutical for the medical

426
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,799
cannabis obviously we need at least no

427
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,519
additional assurances to make sure that

428
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,838
the product is actually as a therapeutic

429
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,399
effect and it's effective to to the

430
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,800
disease that is uh that is tackling on

431
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,879
the adult use we're not ideally we're

432
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,278
not you looking for treating a disease

433
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:33,439
we're looking for just a

434
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:34,958
uh having a recreational

435
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,000
effect so

436
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,078
i think

437
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,039
probably we're talking about

438
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:42,319
something somewhere between jcp and

439
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,799
ngmp

440
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,199
closer to jcp just to show that it is

441
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,719
safe for a consumer to to take because

442
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:50,879
gsp is used for

443
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,440
food uh products so

444
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,120
it should ensure that at least

445
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,199
it is a product that is safe and that

446
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,360
you shouldn't be armpit obviously

447
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:02,078
there's a complement in that which is

448
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,959
maximum amount of thc on product maximum

449
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:05,439
amount

450
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:07,599
that you need to have if you're driving

451
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,360
so all of this needs to be taken into

452
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,199
consideration in addition to the quality

453
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,240
of the product that is insured by the

454
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:16,240
gsp to calculations

455
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,560
maybe to add on that if you look to

456
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,440
growing uh vegetables or fruits it's all

457
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,638
about

458
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,839
global gap i think towards the gcp it's

459
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,959
just a step

460
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:29,279
further all because of consistency like

461
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:32,078
all those said safety for actually the

462
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,919
entities of the product now uh as an

463
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,039
example in the dutch coffee shop you are

464
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,479
you don't know what you're buying

465
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:40,879
actually and that has to change we we

466
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,120
need to go to a direction that just as

467
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:44,000
with your beer on the back side how much

468
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,320
alcohol

469
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,519
is in it that is where we need to to go

470
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,639
to and then

471
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:53,039
yeah your support helps as well to have

472
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,440
that track and trace i know where it is

473
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:57,838
really coming from the product and that

474
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,399
is what we really missing now in the

475
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,519
dutch coffee shops and i think if you

476
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,919
use

477
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,640
towards gcp you can track and trace it

478
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:08,879
back and you can be sure that you buy

479
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,520
actually

480
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,520
a certain amount of dt in your product

481
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:16,160
consumer safety right and also correct

482
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:19,519
protection and at the moment

483
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,679
and anywhere that you buy and be it in

484
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,119
whichever form cannabis you have no idea

485
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,038
what's in there and anyone that has

486
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,279
worked in the testing space anyone that

487
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,200
has worked with more standardization and

488
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,480
looking at the different chemicals or

489
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,400
the different

490
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,679
mold is a big one right i mean half of

491
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,440
the wheat has mold in it and

492
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,519
recalls is one thing you have to be able

493
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,919
to do and it's not even just going over

494
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:44,319
the top about it it just i think global

495
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,880
gap is absolutely fine but it can't be

496
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:49,279
that there is less traceability for weed

497
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,679
or for whatever than there is for

498
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:54,879
tomatoes in your supermarket or for uh

499
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:57,679
or for you know any kind of

500
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,200
natural product absolutely today your uh

501
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,038
your teacher this trace will write to

502
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,279
the source where it's been processed and

503
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,200
produced so

504
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,038
why should this industry be any

505
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,279
different from that and

506
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:11,919
and i think with all that also comes

507
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,440
accessibility right you said

508
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,000
they can buy the coffee shop so there is

509
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,640
an existing structure of where to buy it

510
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,200
from in the netherlands and and this is

511
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,759
going to be key also to fight the black

512
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,360
market if you're in a in a country area

513
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:26,240
not in a big city and you have to drive

514
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,678
20

515
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,120
25 kilometers to to shop or

516
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,360
nothing is available over the weekend

517
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,879
then we open doors for

518
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,759
the dealer that

519
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,919
might come just with a simple ping on on

520
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:43,200
instagram in 10 minutes of the backpack

521
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,520
to your house so in order to to make it

522
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,279
available we need to really think about

523
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,359
the distribution models

524
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:51,119
we heard yesterday whether it's be even

525
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,038
an online thing that you register i mean

526
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,759
you can do all your bank

527
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,519
transfers and and businesses online

528
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,440
after having registered and make sure

529
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,440
that's you doing the business so why

530
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,600
shouldn't that be possible with a with

531
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,759
an online candidate

532
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,599
yeah career or whatever the structure is

533
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,839
like so i think that's very important

534
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:12,798
that we think about that and make the

535
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:14,639
product really available for everybody

536
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:17,279
convenience i think is a big word there

537
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,120
right connections accessibility then

538
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,599
that can come in different models right

539
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:23,119
and then i'll take a quick side step

540
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,359
into what we're doing in switzerland

541
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:26,959
right now where yes it goes to the

542
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:28,639
health ministry it has to sign it off

543
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,400
but then it goes to the municipalities

544
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,240
and then you have you know the police

545
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,240
has to be involved in some ways then you

546
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,160
have identifiers for the people that are

547
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,079
actually consumers but they're not

548
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,519
identifiers there's pseudonyms so you

549
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:43,439
cannot actually link them to their names

550
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,759
and then you have different distribution

551
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,600
models right we have in one city for

552
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:49,759
example they're looking at

553
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:51,199
doing it the same way that there was a

554
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:52,960
government in switzerland if you're a

555
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,200
heroin addict you get methadone from a

556
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,720
government facility that is one approach

557
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,480
then there's the approach of coffee

558
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,919
shops of course coffee shops in

559
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,240
switzerland there they will also be

560
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,960
backed through at the moment the whole

561
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,798
uh

562
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,120
ordering and quality control is still

563
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:09,038
backed by a pharmacy not meaning it has

564
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:11,599
to be sold in the pharmacy but just to

565
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:13,839
have some kind of like quality standard

566
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:16,158
on that part and then we have the social

567
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,839
clubs that also the purchasing and the

568
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,600
guiding is done with the with the

569
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:21,359
qualified person and somebody that's

570
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:22,879
also you know somebody always has to be

571
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:24,879
in charge in the beginning in the

572
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,480
beginning right it can't just be a fool

573
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,720
or that's that's my humble opinion that

574
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,200
can't be full free flow yet

575
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,038
yet and then working towards that so and

576
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,200
then of course there's also the direct

577
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:37,038
distribution online that they're looking

578
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,279
at as you have you can order your

579
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:41,038
medicines online so with all those

580
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,119
different approaches there's not one

581
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,119
that works for everywhere and there's

582
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,199
not just okay you have to go and buy it

583
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,798
there because then you go to your

584
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,640
standard dealer that everybody's going

585
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:51,679
to or whoever you know

586
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,679
and

587
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,280
there i think this is one of the things

588
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,519
that i mentioned earlier with that

589
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,200
consultation phase there's not one model

590
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:00,319
that works across one country there's

591
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,640
even different models in different

592
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:04,480
countries so now going out and saying

593
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,799
this is the way it's going to be

594
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,880
will not help anyone right it will not

595
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,119
open it up it will actually more

596
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,559
isolate that one side and that's another

597
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,038
part we're coming to in a minute you

598
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:17,119
can't isolate one side you have to find

599
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:18,558
an approach that works for everyone and

600
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,319
bring the whole industry together and

601
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:22,558
have everybody that's in this room are

602
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:24,240
out there they have to state and they

603
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:25,599
have actually have to have a voice in

604
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,440
this because otherwise everybody

605
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,439
complains as usual in this industry and

606
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,038
nobody does anything and that doesn't

607
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,960
bring us further

608
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:34,558
we're also good complainers in germany i

609
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,840
love it

610
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:36,720
now but

611
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,759
maybe

612
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,759
i would like to give an example um

613
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:44,640
i work a lot in israel and israel

614
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,240
actually to me is a fascinating market

615
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,280
we know they do a lot of research and

616
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,599
have never

617
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:52,000
neglected the whole cannabis industry

618
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:54,079
we're always active and

619
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,960
i would say they have a semi-medical

620
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:59,839
recreation market so they have actually

621
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,840
more medical patients as we have in

622
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,279
germany right now but being a country 10

623
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:05,199
times smaller

624
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,599
shows how many uh

625
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,720
what the market size is or the

626
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:15,038
percentage of people having access to

627
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:17,279
let's say medical and safe cannabis

628
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:19,839
and what i wanted to say is

629
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:22,798
the accessibility in israel is amazing

630
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:24,240
you can subscribe to the pharmacy

631
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,240
when you have your prescription

632
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,038
obviously from the doctor and they send

633
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,440
you daily menus over whatsapp you see

634
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:33,038
all the strains they have it's amazing

635
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,360
it's it's available it's there you can

636
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:37,599
drive there right now or they will send

637
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:40,240
it to you if you're a registered person

638
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:44,000
person and and you look at 50 different

639
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:47,759
strains um thc 10 15 different strains

640
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,519
and cbd balanced oils fixtures whatever

641
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,200
and they send it to you every day so so

642
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,440
you see the menu you can just order it

643
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,759
and it's super accessible there is

644
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,320
transparency it's grouped in different

645
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:00,079
thc level groups so

646
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:03,279
this is something that

647
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:04,720
i know it's medical but i i think

648
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:07,359
it's a because they don't have

649
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,679
redeveloped the recreational program yet

650
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:12,158
this is some kind of a role model right

651
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,840
now to me how accessibility should look

652
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,360
like

653
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:16,959
and

654
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:19,199
you mentioned it earlier we don't want

655
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,798
to have kind of an american

656
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,360
model where every state does its own

657
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:26,079
thing and there is no overarching

658
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:27,759
let's say common sense and common rules

659
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:30,558
you travel from

660
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:33,200
portugal to the netherlands to germany

661
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:36,079
will that even be allowed in the future

662
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,840
if one of the countries has legal access

663
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,359
to recreation right now it's not you

664
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:42,399
cannot buy in the netherlands and drive

665
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:44,479
to to germany you're committing a crime

666
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,200
actually so

667
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,519
alignment between the countries would be

668
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,960
would be a very very appreciative thing

669
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,200
i i guess

670
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,038
for all of us here in the room

671
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,278
i think what you're mentioning the

672
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,519
different forms of products in israel

673
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:01,919
also in nolan the big thing is actually

674
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:03,599
the accessibility of

675
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,919
us for example because a lot of people

676
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,678
don't know that a big portion of what

677
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,840
the coffee shops are selling is actually

678
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,400
this product and the product is actually

679
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,158
coming out of morocco

680
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,880
often so

681
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,200
accessibility to this same products as

682
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,880
people are used to get needs to be there

683
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,679
and that is also a challenge for all the

684
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,960
10 growers where to get this experience

685
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,440
and

686
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,840
people are really straightforward we we

687
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,880
also want to buy future debt stuff from

688
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:33,199
worker

689
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,480
and that is different than what we know

690
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,720
what's happening in north america with

691
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,558
ice production that is not the same no

692
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,480
it's not the same it's a different

693
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:41,839
different profile and actually this

694
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,519
brings me to another thing that we

695
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:45,199
didn't discuss with drop it in anyways

696
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:46,798
there is a reason why it's only second

697
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,880
to your cities in holland at the moment

698
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:50,639
right the reason why they have the

699
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,400
second tier cities in holland is because

700
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,759
they're afraid of the gap that is left

701
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,000
in the market of distribute of supply in

702
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:59,839
the first tier cities now i think you

703
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,359
all can figure out yourself what i'm

704
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,439
talking about there and i think this is

705
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:05,038
one of the big big issues that also have

706
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,038
to be addressed and tackled before we

707
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:08,640
just do now okay let's make a model that

708
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:10,879
works we have big companies that make

709
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,600
big facilities they all supply everyone

710
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,159
yada yada and then after that you have a

711
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:17,918
vacuum and usually like you're with

712
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,600
people that need to do something and if

713
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,200
they don't have anything to do they'll

714
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:23,038
do something else so this is something

715
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,319
that has to be addressed that can be

716
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:26,000
addressed in different ways i'm not

717
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:26,839
gonna i mean there's there's different

718
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,240
you

719
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:29,038
know it

720
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,960
like

721
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,038
you give them a certain time you give

722
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,480
them a chance to come forward with a

723
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:36,640
chance to you know

724
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,919
self

725
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,720
self

726
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,720
in

727
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,720
substance

728
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,000
good question i don't know all right

729
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,240
like an amnesty program right we're

730
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,400
giving time to come from from stepping

731
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,919
out of the dark so to say come forward

732
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,360
in front of the law and say you've come

733
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,640
forward with that in the past and now

734
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:56,479
your record could be cleared back

735
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,240
exactly and create the point zero and

736
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,159
then move forward and then like that

737
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,079
have the part of the overall industry

738
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,080
and this is a big i think for me that's

739
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:06,079
something nobody talks about because

740
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,519
needless to say this has been a long

741
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:10,240
this has been around for a very long

742
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:12,558
time and i was very happy to be part of

743
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,960
the consultation process here in germany

744
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:16,879
a couple of weeks ago here in berlin and

745
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,400
the gentleman from from holland that

746
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,278
organizes all the coffee shops one of

747
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,278
the coffee shops association he was like

748
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:25,278
how can we bring the moroccan hash back

749
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:26,798
because the people will want that hash

750
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,880
if it's not there they will just go

751
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:30,400
around it so it's a there's a lot of

752
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,919
more homework to be done is what i want

753
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,600
to say with that not that i'm saying

754
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,720
blueprint or any one of us i don't want

755
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:36,399
to be the one that has to make the

756
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,319
blueprint but i'm definitely here to

757
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,919
speak up and put up my voice and i think

758
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:42,079
everybody should also do that in their

759
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,320
capacity and not just be one on the

760
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,918
outside and just say no no no this is

761
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:47,918
not good it's not good that's completely

762
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,600
open let's completely run around and you

763
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,679
know i

764
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:53,678
i just want to say there's a bit more

765
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:57,120
homework to be done in my

766
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,120
in my opinion and

767
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,120
we need to close these gaps all of them

768
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:03,839
right accessibility

769
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:06,079
supply chain

770
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,119
variability in the product is very

771
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:09,199
important

772
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:11,199
and although you said

773
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,120
earlier that

774
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,080
ideally people in the recreational

775
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:17,918
market

776
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:19,839
don't buy for disease treatment

777
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,360
but let's face it there are so many

778
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:22,720
people that do it right now and they

779
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:24,959
don't even buy from the wreck they buy

780
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,880
from their legal market and they may

781
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,798
have found their hush

782
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,240
that works for them so if you change all

783
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:32,879
that we know how

784
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,278
how important

785
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,720
the very transition of the strain is to

786
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,640
if you have found it for yourself for

787
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,038
your endocannabinoid system to be

788
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,038
received and if you change all that you

789
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:45,440
lose these these patients these

790
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:47,038
consumers yeah control over the supply

791
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,278
chain i think it's the

792
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:51,359
it's the key to all this and it doesn't

793
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:53,919
depend on the country to legalize the

794
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:57,038
other tubes it depends on

795
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,720
if there's a morocco ash that comes from

796
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:00,640
from this country then you need to

797
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,278
legalize it there and have the in place

798
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,520
controls that make sure that the quality

799
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:06,880
is there that you're because this is not

800
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,519
growing tomatoes we don't test the

801
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,080
tomato for an api for an active

802
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:13,679
ingredient we but we test cannabis we

803
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:16,398
need to have a specification in place

804
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,399
and having jc gcp regulations in place

805
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,479
doesn't mean lack of control

806
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:22,000
it means that you have a specification

807
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,599
that you need to comply with to release

808
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,319
the product in the market

809
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,839
there's this still applies it doesn't uh

810
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,480
it doesn't mean that you like lack of

811
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,439
control so if you have this standardized

812
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,000
across

813
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,159
the world ideally um

814
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,398
if you have this these standards

815
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:41,120
complied with each country and it is

816
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:43,359
regulated and controlled in that country

817
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,519
then we'll have better control over this

818
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:47,038
and well at the moment it's the one that

819
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,679
controls the whole

820
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:51,440
basically the supply chain in the world

821
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:55,360
and make sure that

822
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:59,120
we don't have loss of control or a theft

823
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:01,119
of controlled substance

824
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:03,439
so this is not one country to decide we

825
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,959
need to learn from each other i think

826
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,200
europe has a lot to learn from the

827
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,120
mistakes made in canada from what's been

828
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,120
implemented in the us i think there's

829
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:12,879
good things there's things that we need

830
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:13,759
to learn from and improve

831
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,919
and

832
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,278
we cannot shut our eyes to what others

833
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,480
have done because otherwise we will

834
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:20,960
learn from it and we'll make the same

835
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,960
mistakes

836
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:28,320
so yeah it's uh it's important that we

837
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,240
learn from some models i think

838
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:32,319
having the the adult use for instance

839
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,839
having

840
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:35,839
having some kind of description i've

841
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,519
been in a in a dispensary have just came

842
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:38,879
from came from from the u.s i've been in

843
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:40,960
a dispensary there and there was a

844
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,640
dispensary that had basically the

845
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,120
product was ordered on a table and a

846
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,360
tablet inside the the inside the

847
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:49,918
dispensary and there was description of

848
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:52,240
the product there was a valuation on

849
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,320
what it did for you from a focus point

850
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,919
of view from a sleep point of view if it

851
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:58,319
is energetic if it is something like

852
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,520
that so if you can have this

853
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,439
at least this information for the

854
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,079
program i think information is key for

855
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,399
this because you don't know what you're

856
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:09,519
buying because it's not just a teacher

857
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:11,439
it's the whole components of the of the

858
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,599
of the plant it's the the flavonoids

859
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,600
it's the terpenes and everything will

860
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:17,119
will come along and give you a different

861
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:18,719
different sensation and different

862
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:21,119
experience when you're when you're

863
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,480
smoking it or vaping it or whatever

864
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,639
we're doing with it

865
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,038
so i think it's important to give also

866
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,360
this information to the to the consumers

867
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:32,640
so that they know what to expect and

868
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:34,158
they can choose um what's actually their

869
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,360
their purchasing

870
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,640
that's

871
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:38,639
something that we're discussing

872
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,480
internally all the time is that

873
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,640
i mean we are all from the industry we

874
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,000
have a good idea what what product could

875
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,159
do to us but

876
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,640
um if we want to win

877
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,200
people that are not consumers that and

878
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:54,960
yet and we want we want to create

879
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,558
accessibility and transparency for them

880
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,640
is like with wines right on the back

881
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:01,759
it's written it complements with certain

882
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,360
foods it it has it has this that taste

883
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,960
and if you

884
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:07,359
yeah so if you want to make a wine

885
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,360
choice they give you some options and

886
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:11,439
hints what you if you're even if you're

887
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,918
not an expert what you

888
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,798
what you can choose and and i think also

889
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,000
we need

890
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:19,679
a kind of a

891
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,200
traffic sign or or or taste wheel

892
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:26,080
kind of easy graph on product or

893
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,720
in the stores that describe

894
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:28,720
the actual

895
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,840
power of the product let's go that way

896
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,840
right so

897
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:37,278
this is extremely important to open the

898
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:39,038
market for other user groups i guess

899
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:40,640
and create a standardization throughout

900
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:43,278
right i mean i think this should be the

901
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,840
same in every country

902
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:47,919
like sugar content in food exactly like

903
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,918
now we have sugar content coming up and

904
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,759
it's a big thing people forgot yeah we

905
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,360
had a lot of little sugar now there's a

906
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:55,200
lot of a lot of issues coming out of

907
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:56,879
that we have it with alcohol you have

908
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,480
beer that has a certain percentage it

909
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,320
has a certain tax on it you have wine

910
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,919
that's a high percentage of higher tax

911
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,789
that's how you naturally also can kind

912
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,440
of guide the consumer towards a more

913
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:06,720
[Music]

914
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,919
softer

915
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,159
consumption and then well outside of all

916
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,600
of that

917
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,320
what

918
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,918
for in you guys opinion now we've talked

919
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:19,519
about what europe has been doing we

920
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,759
talked a little bit about the outside

921
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,679
approaches and we don't want to say that

922
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:25,679
the u.s and canada did everything wrong

923
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,919
not at all not at all they were front

924
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,720
runners

925
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:34,080
a lot of pioneering a lot of a b testing

926
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,640
a lot of you know cowboy mentality and a

927
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:39,359
lot of business first approach which has

928
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,799
it's very rightful place within within

929
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:43,119
an industry i think

930
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,759
anyone that comes from more economical

931
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:47,599
background sometimes and without the

932
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:50,000
business first approach at the same time

933
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:51,839
we also like slow and steady and i

934
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,720
believe still slow and steady wins the

935
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:55,119
race

936
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,640
um are there in your opinions any key

937
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:58,959
learnings that we should take from

938
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,720
outside because actually this panel has

939
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,720
been put together a little bit also and

940
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,120
everybody that is sitting here has

941
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,600
explained extensive

942
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:08,798
experience outside of europe but they're

943
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:11,278
working

944
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:12,798
from europe to the outside and from the

945
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:14,640
different aspects of it what have you

946
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:15,440
seen outside that you think we should

947
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,720
take

948
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,120
and

949
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,240
and then that could work on our our

950
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:21,839
grounds

951
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,759
actually i want to dive back to the

952
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:25,519
cultivation side of things

953
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:27,919
because that's where it all starts and

954
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,000
if you look to

955
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,919
the with the coffee shop in holland we

956
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,919
have a way how to get product to the

957
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,080
consumers but

958
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,240
at this moment

959
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:40,398
you have like a vertical integrated

960
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,038
company they all need to be certain need

961
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:45,038
to have their own models propagation but

962
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:46,720
why are we so big in the in the growing

963
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:49,759
industry in the netherlands because we

964
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:52,079
have specialists for propagation who do

965
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:54,558
all the cloning we have growers and then

966
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:56,639
we have more towards poison harvest now

967
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:58,960
they need to do all so you need to

968
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,038
actually build a company with four

969
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,038
different companies within the company

970
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:05,038
and i think when

971
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:06,640
implementation of the everything

972
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:08,719
regarding recreational cannabis they

973
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,960
should not forget about

974
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:13,519
the growing part and may make it

975
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,679
possible that growers can buy rooted

976
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:17,759
clones from other companies because that

977
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,599
is what is lacking now as well in many

978
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,839
countries

979
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,679
they need to do all but yeah

980
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:25,119
it is something special and you cannot

981
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,398
do everything

982
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,919
really well

983
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,679
without me wanting to be too much

984
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,199
commercial at this stage but this is

985
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,119
exactly what

986
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,960
we are trying to tackle from my company

987
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,320
we looked at all these countries that

988
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,878
are the companies that are completely

989
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,119
vertically integrated and that's not an

990
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:42,559
economically viable system right usually

991
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,919
in any other industry you have

992
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:45,838
specialists in different parts of the

993
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:47,358
supply chain and then you have to work

994
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:50,639
with each other but because of the

995
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:52,960
hardship of the regulatory non-existing

996
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,039
or less existing framework you have a

997
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,800
lot of completely vertically integrated

998
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:59,279
companies which doesn't make the most

999
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,359
efficient doesn't make them specialists

1000
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,800
so we believe through full transparency

1001
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:05,199
throughout the whole supply chain you

1002
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,320
can break that vertical integration into

1003
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,078
what i would like to say more of a

1004
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,680
horizontal integration you can still

1005
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,519
have quality control you can still have

1006
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:13,759
batch release systems you can set up

1007
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:15,199
coas at every stage of the production

1008
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,880
and therefore actually then also

1009
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,118
consumer protection in the end but you

1010
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,880
can allow the clones to be done by the

1011
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,640
best clone

1012
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,640
clone manufacturer cultivator

1013
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:26,559
cultivation done by the specialist in

1014
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:30,400
that then it goes to you know a

1015
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:32,480
manufacturer that is specifically just

1016
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,400
the big manufacturers in pharma are in

1017
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,838
actually out of food products they're

1018
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,599
contract manufacturers they don't

1019
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:39,599
produce their own products they produce

1020
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,960
for everyone else and this is another

1021
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,200
big thing that i believe we have to

1022
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,280
break up i see michelle stood up there

1023
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:47,358
so is this the time michelle for us to

1024
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,960
ask some questions from the audience or

1025
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:51,920
yeah yes please

1026
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,920
shot like always

1027
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:55,569
let's hear it again for uh lou krishner

1028
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,659
and your

1029
00:35:55,570 --> 00:36:05,199
[Music]

1030
00:35:55,659 --> 00:36:05,199
[Applause]

1031
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:10,879
hi thanks a lot for the panel my

1032
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:12,559
question is like about the supply chains

1033
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,960
and the legalization process in germany

1034
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:16,639
so right now the biggest community

1035
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,559
pharmacy organization like the only one

1036
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,879
who talks to the government actually has

1037
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:23,199
as an impact says we can help you with

1038
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,000
expansion if we legalize but only if we

1039
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:28,159
do like in community pharmacies only

1040
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,199
because that's the only way the only way

1041
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,159
we can

1042
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:34,159
we can save the track and trace process

1043
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:35,598
and with your experience what do you

1044
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:37,920
think about this statement about this

1045
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,079
approach

1046
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,280
i'm not 100 sure about the question so

1047
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,519
that the the track and trace is only uh

1048
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,400
applicable when there is certain

1049
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:50,880
dispensaries from the network no no um

1050
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,440
the community pharmacists in germany say

1051
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,320
we can take care about the dispensing

1052
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,559
but only if the dispension only works

1053
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,800
throughout pharmacies because that's the

1054
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:03,119
only way we can take care about the

1055
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,720
supply chain well that is of course

1056
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,320
because they want to keep their

1057
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:07,759
interests and they have a strong lobby

1058
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,838
group there which is their rightful

1059
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,920
thing to do but then there are solutions

1060
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:12,880
out there like for example mine or other

1061
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,200
ones

1062
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,519
that actually exactly are dedicated to

1063
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:19,439
break this up you can move between

1064
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:21,759
different problems between different

1065
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,240
dispensing models and still have a full

1066
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,400
traceability fully

1067
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,159
you know integral supply chain without

1068
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,079
any product leaving from one side of the

1069
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:32,559
other or any product entering the supply

1070
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,800
chain so this is of course a statement

1071
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:36,880
that was brought in there from uh from

1072
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,960
promoter strong lobby groups which i

1073
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,480
believe very much are important to all

1074
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,280
have within

1075
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,119
and

1076
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,280
not fight against this

1077
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,800
next few stages because the more you

1078
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,560
have all stakeholders involved and

1079
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,119
happier behind it

1080
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:54,159
the sooner we can move towards the next

1081
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:57,280
station or the next uh

1082
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:58,399
just just to add i think personally that

1083
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,480
we shouldn't

1084
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,079
neglect an existing network of

1085
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,800
pharmacies that we have they're

1086
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,200
specialists i think it's it's the lowest

1087
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,599
hurdle to train these people

1088
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:11,118
also on the consumption and application

1089
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,960
of

1090
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,440
not only medical but also recreational

1091
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,320
cannabis so

1092
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:21,200
it would be in my opinion not wise to

1093
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,880
exclude that and try to differentiate or

1094
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:26,719
make a hard cut between the recreation

1095
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:28,720
of the medical dispension of cannabis

1096
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:31,118
because that network exists it's all

1097
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:33,358
over and it's even in small rural areas

1098
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,838
usually you have a pharmacy so

1099
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:38,159
so again accessibility and professional

1100
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:41,279
advice which is part of the

1101
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:43,838
of the proposal for law in germany that

1102
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,760
you need a trained person

1103
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:48,719
which i think is a very very good thing

1104
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,680
and we should obviously do that so um

1105
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:51,199
yeah

1106
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:53,039
and i hope that answers your question a

1107
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:54,078
little bit it's part of the convenience

1108
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,519
right again

1109
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,800
apps you started with at the end of the

1110
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:59,199
day it has to be a model that's

1111
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,760
convenient and the most

1112
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:03,679
widespread distribution model straight

1113
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,839
away available overnight is through

1114
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:08,000
pharmacies now if the pharmacist trains

1115
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,599
someone that is not a pharmacist to then

1116
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,519
be the person in the dispensary that's a

1117
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,640
different story there's many ways to

1118
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:15,440
work with

1119
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:15,440
and

1120
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:20,480
[Music]

1121
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,440
i'm interested to to see a pharmacist

1122
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,679
help

1123
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,240
someone that's new to cannabis

1124
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:28,639
to show how to apply the cannabis so if

1125
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,319
he's buying a flower will the pharmacist

1126
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:32,559
help him or her

1127
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,920
rolling a joint packing the pipe i don't

1128
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:37,039
know but

1129
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,880
it's going to be interesting

1130
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:40,880
good morning matt dickinson from clarion

1131
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,280
canvas we're doing indoor

1132
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,519
small batch craft cultivation and

1133
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,920
portugal a question for you guys and

1134
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:49,838
thanks to the panel as we move into

1135
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,320
legalization or adult use what do you

1136
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:54,880
think we'll see dropped in terms of the

1137
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,400
gmp to gacp

1138
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,599
restrictions and do you think we'll see

1139
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,599
any changes to that at all

1140
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,119
the question

1141
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,280
so

1142
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:10,160
as we move from legalization we're

1143
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,079
starting from that from medical or to

1144
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:14,159
adult use do you think that we're going

1145
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,160
to see some of the restrictions that we

1146
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:18,799
currently have with gmp

1147
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:20,318
dropped and moved more into a gacp model

1148
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,318
or do you think those restrictions were

1149
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:25,119
specifically with to do with

1150
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:27,039
microbial accounts consistency product

1151
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,318
registration

1152
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:32,000
labeling things like that do you think

1153
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:32,000
we'll see those dropped or relaxed

1154
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,839
um

1155
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:38,639
from an adult use point of view in a

1156
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:40,960
consumer point of view

1157
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:43,039
part of those restrictions probably will

1158
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,800
will fall the specification side it's a

1159
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:46,719
question of safety so i don't think it

1160
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,318
will vary too much the specification

1161
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:53,039
that you get from gcp from the gcp part

1162
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:54,318
on the labeling on the type of packaging

1163
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:57,920
that you can use eventually there will

1164
00:40:54,318 --> 00:41:00,079
be some variation but bear in mind that

1165
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,559
cannabis is being used for

1166
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,480
equivalent to food grade materials so

1167
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:07,599
specifications on materials should be

1168
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,280
probably the same won't vary it much

1169
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,280
the only thing i see is the labeling

1170
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,040
that can have different information

1171
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,160
because you're not treating an illness

1172
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:17,119
you're talking really you're talking

1173
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:19,118
about the regression and use so i think

1174
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,640
i think it will become much more

1175
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:23,119
accessible and then all the

1176
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:26,239
conversations that i was part of was to

1177
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,720
to lower those barriers without losing

1178
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:31,598
the quality control and the traceability

1179
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:33,838
and all of those aspects so i think the

1180
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:36,160
life for a craft cultivator and it's

1181
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:38,078
going to become

1182
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:39,759
easier than ever because it shouldn't be

1183
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,000
easy i don't think it should be easy but

1184
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,000
it will become

1185
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,519
more accessible

1186
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,960
thank you thank you so very much we're

1187
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:48,860
actually out of time let's hear it once

1188
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,128
again

1189
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:52,128
