1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,270
all right we're gonna keep the knowledge

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,620
coming our next panel is called cannabis

3
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:09,439
deconstructed and our next speaker is a

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,570
neuroscientist with more than 20

5
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:15,088
peer-reviewed articles and publications

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:17,190
he is the founder and CEO of Medi

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:20,640
tourists please give a warm welcome for

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:24,990
mr. dr. Yeoh bukas is your Brook y'all

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:28,349
on yo-yo Cuba's your bukas thank you

10
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:30,868
very much thank you Alex and I CBC

11
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:34,679
organisers for doing this great meeting

12
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:37,920
this is my third opportunity to share

13
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:42,659
some knowledge and to challenge our

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:47,429
thinking at the ICBC the first time I

15
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:49,500
joined ICBC in 2016 in Vancouver I was

16
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:52,558
here last year in Berlin and it was so

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,289
good that we all decided that we should

18
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:58,738
be back here again this year and it's a

19
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:01,379
pleasure to be here my name is yacouba's

20
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:07,048
de Burgos I know it's easy to butcher it

21
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:12,118
so I go by dr. Z and my students

22
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:14,330
favorite is dr. Jay Z so without further

23
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:16,739
ado I'm gonna talk about cannabis

24
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:19,170
deconstructed and I'm gonna tell you

25
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:22,739
some of the some of the thoughts that I

26
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,960
have about cannabis and before we start

27
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:27,868
talking about cannabis we can start

28
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,250
talking instructing the human body

29
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:32,700
system that is called the

30
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,009
endocannabinoid system we all mammals

31
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,159
having the cannabinoid system even some

32
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:40,769
more primitive animals and animals and

33
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,259
creatures that live in the sea they also

34
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:46,500
have the endocannabinoid system the

35
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:49,228
endocannabinoid system is very complex

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,780
it is widely distributed throughout the

37
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:54,090
body so it is not just found in one

38
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,478
location it is essentially found in

39
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,368
almost every cell in our bodies and if

40
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:02,158
you look at this chart what it shows you

41
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:04,680
is cannabinoid receptors cannabinoid

42
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,780
receptor 1 and cannabinoid receptor 2

43
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,659
are distributed differently in different

44
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,520
organs and our bodies produces

45
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:13,318
endocannabinoids so we generate

46
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,799
ourselves cannabinoids

47
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:18,958
as needed and thus we sometimes need

48
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:22,170
supplement of cannabinoid that comes

49
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,139
exogenously as well so endocannabinoids

50
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:29,638
is a major one sahrin and amide and to

51
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:31,920
AG or a crocodile glycerol and these

52
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:34,650
endocannabinoids bind cannabinoid

53
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:37,828
receptors cannabinoid receptor 1 CB 1 is

54
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:41,819
mostly expressed in the brain also and

55
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:44,939
this is the fact of cancer tea but you

56
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:48,060
will so find cb1 receptors in liver and

57
00:02:44,938 --> 00:02:50,729
the digestive system in kidneys in

58
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,128
bladder so it is widely expressed

59
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:55,979
throughout the body cb2 receptors are

60
00:02:53,128 --> 00:02:58,739
more expressed in the organs and cells

61
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:01,138
that are related to the immune response

62
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,919
and it is widely distributed throughout

63
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,040
the body

64
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:07,799
the first boost of the endocannabinoids

65
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:11,310
and engagement of endocannabinoid system

66
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:14,069
happens with birth and with suckling it

67
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,530
is something that makes you hungry that

68
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:18,839
makes you eat and only after you eat you

69
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,878
get a boost of dopamine which gives you

70
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,039
the satisfaction for eating but

71
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:25,018
something makes you go eat and it's

72
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,429
probably the endocannabinoids because

73
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,609
this is one of the functions of

74
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:32,759
endocannabinoids they modulate pain and

75
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:34,859
stress immune function appetite memory

76
00:03:32,758 --> 00:03:37,738
inflammation thermal regulation and

77
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:40,590
metabolism and phyto cannabinoids such

78
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:42,959
as THC for example are similar in

79
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:46,469
structure to in and amide and thus they

80
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,889
will bind the same receptors as does an

81
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:52,318
and amide and this interaction here is

82
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:54,900
pretty complex you can think of phyto

83
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:58,258
cannabinoids or cannabinoids binding to

84
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,900
the receptors in a key and a lock like

85
00:03:58,258 --> 00:04:03,718
fashion however it is not that simple

86
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:07,199
and several cannabinoids for example THC

87
00:04:03,718 --> 00:04:09,468
and CBD will bind the same receptor

88
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:12,479
therefore the receptor which can be

89
00:04:09,468 --> 00:04:14,340
represented here by a door and the

90
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,038
function of the doors to be open and

91
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,218
closed appropriately the function of the

92
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:22,560
receptor to be activated or deactivated

93
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:24,560
appropriately and in order to engage the

94
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,910
sender cannabinoid system and receptors

95
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,120
multiple molecules have

96
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:32,580
bind to these receptors and multiple

97
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,980
locks exist on these receptors in order

98
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:39,719
to regulate properly the function of

99
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:41,939
these receptors now if we look at what

100
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,160
happens in the brain and also what

101
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:46,319
happens many places in the body this is

102
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,550
a simplified example with it's still

103
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:53,040
complex but when neurons are active what

104
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,840
happens is neurons produce a lot of

105
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,810
electrical positive charge that is

106
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:59,250
called depolarization that

107
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,319
depolarization allows for calcium to

108
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,269
influx and allows for the

109
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:05,550
neurotransmitter vesicles that are

110
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:07,949
chemicals that signal in our brain and

111
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,569
body to be released in the synapse

112
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:11,639
between two neurons

113
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:13,980
now the release of these

114
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,349
neurotransmitters and increased

115
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,550
excitation and depolarization and in

116
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,060
particular I'm talking here about

117
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:23,189
glutamate excitatory neurotransmitter

118
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:26,129
on-demand will then produce the

119
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:28,139
synthesis of endocannabinoids the

120
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:30,480
central cannabinoids are not stored in

121
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:32,849
the vesicles and they will cross freely

122
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,610
through the plasma membranes will travel

123
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:38,610
retrograde Li and will see B receptors

124
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:41,340
the C B receptor so located on neurons

125
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:44,430
but the cb2 receptors as well as cb1

126
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:45,779
receptors are also located on other type

127
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,790
of brain cells that are called glia

128
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:49,979
they're also very important in

129
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:53,010
information processing and brain

130
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:54,680
function so it's a system where and the

131
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:57,300
cannabinoids are synthesized on-demand

132
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,180
they pass through the membranes and they

133
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,939
activate CB receptors if there is no

134
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,160
control of glutamate you can have

135
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:09,300
glutamate excitotoxicity you can also

136
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:12,750
have calyx C city and cb1 receptor

137
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:15,560
activation turns off the influx of

138
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:18,379
calcium and regulates the release

139
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:21,120
neurotransmitters thereby balancing the

140
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:24,089
excitatory activity not just glutamate

141
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,889
no gamma amino butyric acid or GABA in

142
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:32,819
the neuronal synapses as well now in the

143
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:35,579
brain cb1 and cb2 expressed in many

144
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:37,680
different structures and you can see

145
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:40,019
that this is cb1 receptor that is

146
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,418
abundant in structure

147
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:44,098
such as hippocampus for example which is

148
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:47,310
responsible for learning memory and

149
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:50,219
stress but also the frontal cortex which

150
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:53,639
is responsible for executive functions

151
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:56,840
it is also expressed in the brainstem

152
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:59,728
that controls some of the vital function

153
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:02,189
interestingly the opiate receptors in

154
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:05,430
the brainstem are expressed in the part

155
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:08,069
that controls the breathing therefore it

156
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:10,139
is easy to die from opiates and have an

157
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:12,900
overdose by shutting down the breathing

158
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:15,569
centers and the cannabinoid receptors

159
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:18,418
actually located in the areas nearby in

160
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:20,848
the brainstem that control nausea and

161
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:24,990
vomiting but they are not expressed in

162
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:27,389
the breathing centers other receptor

163
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,668
targets so endocannabinoids do not just

164
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:32,340
bind Seabee receptors they target other

165
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:34,139
receptors and it explains the multitude

166
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:36,168
of functions and the multitude of

167
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:40,288
effects that people are seeing from

168
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:43,168
either one vital cannabinoid or the

169
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:45,538
group of vital cannabinoids in the case

170
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:48,359
of extractions and isolates of cannabis

171
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:50,939
trip v1 receptor is very important this

172
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,098
is your sensory afferents it's the

173
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:56,009
receptor that essentially mediates

174
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:58,079
analgesic functions or pain so

175
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:00,210
endocannabinoids target to be one

176
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,339
receptor they also target P power

177
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:04,288
peroxisome proliferator activated

178
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:06,658
receptor which is involved in

179
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:09,689
tumorigenesis metabolism development

180
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:15,360
self differentiation it also targets GP

181
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:17,459
r55 which is protein-coding receptor but

182
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,830
it's physiological function is not

183
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:22,709
completely known the whole idea is

184
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:25,258
massive and complex regulatory system

185
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:27,149
it's a homeostatic regular satori system

186
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:29,729
that has multiple targets multiple

187
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:32,788
actors and it's expressed throughout the

188
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:35,819
body so to engage them the cannabinoid

189
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:37,769
system you have stress you have trauma

190
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,570
you have hyperexcitability in the

191
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:42,538
tissues or in the brain you have

192
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:46,079
inflammation and the response of the

193
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:49,919
endocannabinoid system is eat make you

194
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:53,489
hungry go eat rest and sleep get drowsy

195
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:55,708
and sleep forget because it's important

196
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,629
forget things forgetting is an important

197
00:08:55,708 --> 00:09:00,419
part of the survival if we remembered

198
00:08:57,629 --> 00:09:03,570
everything we would be overloaded

199
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:06,509
mentally psychologically and also

200
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:09,089
protect the neuroprotection by

201
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:11,429
controlling neurotransmitters and also a

202
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:15,050
significant role in gastric protection

203
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:17,939
and regulation of the digestive system

204
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:20,338
thus and the cannabinoid system is

205
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,500
regulating our body which is teetering

206
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:25,290
constantly between excitation and

207
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,389
inhibition it is a finite system our

208
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:29,849
brains and bodies it's a sensitive

209
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:31,500
system but it is balanced more or less

210
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,970
between the interactions of the

211
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,690
endocannabinoids multitude of

212
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:38,759
neurotransmitters in our bodies the

213
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,800
endocannabinoid system again can be

214
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:42,860
modulated and we can talk about how we

215
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:45,899
can modulate on the cannabinoid system

216
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:48,810
so the first thing that comes to mind of

217
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:52,049
course is synthetic pharmaceuticals such

218
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:55,199
as synthetic THC that has been on the

219
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:57,689
market for any many years interestingly

220
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,528
synthetic THC that's pharmaceutical is

221
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:03,360
on schedule 2 and on schedule 3 and THC

222
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:05,899
that is natural from the plant is a

223
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,899
Schedule one

224
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:11,549
on substance is actually listed on three

225
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,200
schedules the justification is that

226
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:15,359
there are additives added into these

227
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,520
medications however there are no proof

228
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,490
that these additives are working

229
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,909
biological independently or making see

230
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:25,560
THC that is synthetic more effective so

231
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:28,409
we have therapeutic approaches to

232
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:30,838
modulating in the cannabinoid system of

233
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:33,449
course we can modulate the synthesis and

234
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,370
the degradation of endocannabinoids and

235
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:39,750
a lot of the synthesis happens through

236
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:43,649
this molecule H can modulate cb1 and cb2

237
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:46,500
is we can have supplements with

238
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:48,330
exogenous phyto cannabinoids we have to

239
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,070
remember that when we talk about fighter

240
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:52,110
cannabinoids and supplements we're not

241
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:54,209
just talking about smoking cannabis and

242
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,269
rolling joints the fastest-growing

243
00:10:54,208 --> 00:11:01,109
demographic of cannabis users are baby

244
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:02,819
boomers and they are very interested in

245
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,860
many different preparations of how to

246
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:08,180
use cannabis and a lot of times they

247
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:10,379
don't want to necessarily smoke cannabis

248
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:12,019
reports of cannabis positively

249
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:15,509
modulating mental and physiological

250
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:17,519
processes are beyond anecdotal I always

251
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:19,799
tell this industry needs to stop saying

252
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,299
that this is an anecdote as an example

253
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:24,649
because when you go to any medical

254
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:27,208
meeting these anecdotes article studies

255
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:30,240
but when it comes to cannabis or

256
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:32,369
cannabis use they become anecdotes now

257
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,930
there's thousands of anecdotes we'll all

258
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,060
know that the research has been

259
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:38,699
restricted and is still restricted on

260
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:40,588
cannabis not on synthetic cannabinoids

261
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:44,040
but on cannabis and it's very limited

262
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:46,200
and therefore there may be inconclusive

263
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,750
evidence and you can set your own

264
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:52,110
strength and shield stringency level and

265
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,549
factual information that you involve in

266
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,490
this decision to make whether the

267
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:57,328
cannabis is effective medicine for

268
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,629
certain things

269
00:11:57,328 --> 00:12:02,399
now let's deconstruct cannabis so we

270
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:05,129
just talked about the endocannabinoid

271
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,789
system and we deconstructed the system

272
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:10,139
into receptors into the endocannabinoids

273
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:11,129
and the distribution of the system

274
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:13,980
throughout the body

275
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:18,179
now let's deconstruct cannabis because

276
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,560
cannabis as medicine has been reported

277
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:22,528
by Chinese

278
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:25,079
shandong and is written up in the paint

279
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:27,360
our Ching which is the first book of

280
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,820
herbs essentially of herbal healing and

281
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,740
the Emperor was growing cannabis and

282
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,050
using it for medicinal purposes and was

283
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,930
really trying to understand what kind of

284
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:39,809
cannabis is being grown and what it can

285
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:42,329
be used for so all of the action and

286
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:45,000
cannabis in the plant is in the

287
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:48,028
cannabinoids and in the terpenes that

288
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,879
are mostly located in these very

289
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:52,679
beautiful trichomes on the plant there

290
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,539
is approximately three different types

291
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:57,179
of trichomes that are different by size

292
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:59,490
and these trichomes will contain these

293
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:02,370
glands will contain the cannabinoids as

294
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:04,200
well as the aromatic molecules let's

295
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:06,179
talk about something else let's talk

296
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,330
about some basic misconceptions that

297
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:11,250
exist

298
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:14,670
THC cannabis and what distinguishes

299
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:17,100
really hemp or industrial hemp from

300
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:19,588
medical or adult use cannabis or

301
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,960
recreational cannabis and I think that

302
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:24,510
distinguishes the two is THC

303
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:27,570
of course there are differences in the

304
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:29,549
way the plant itself looks but the only

305
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:32,820
real difference is the expression level

306
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:35,338
of THC so if we look at the industrial

307
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:38,670
hemp cannabis sativa cannabis ruderalis

308
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:42,210
by regulators the amount of THC it set

309
00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:47,429
at 0.2% in Europe not in every countries

310
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:53,210
which one has it at 1% why who regulates

311
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:55,859
0.2 0.3 0.5 percent or 1% nature does

312
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:58,019
because you can have a certified seed

313
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:01,200
and you can have a certified plant that

314
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:03,389
is supposed to have 0.2 or below level

315
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,180
of THC but with certain grow condition

316
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:10,529
and maybe more some all of a sudden can

317
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:12,719
jump to 0.4 0.5 percent THC and in fact

318
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:14,429
a lot of farmers that get punished for

319
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,830
that they have no way of controlling it

320
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:18,629
they have done everything right they can

321
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,879
control the nature because the plants

322
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:22,830
are grown outdoors and naturally

323
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:27,929
industrial hemp plants actually like to

324
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:30,780
have 0.5 to 1% THC high THC cannabis is

325
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:33,269
sativa and indica and mostly hybrids now

326
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:35,129
that are in the market the highest

327
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:37,139
percentage of cannabinoids that these

328
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:40,439
plants can express is up into the

329
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:42,210
thirties percent of THC or CBD that's

330
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,580
simply just limited by the genetic

331
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:47,310
material and genetic mechanism of

332
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,889
production of these molecules so there

333
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:53,969
is a finite limit there is no plant that

334
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:57,539
can produce 65% of THC it will all get

335
00:14:53,970 --> 00:15:00,680
cut off around 3035 percent now what I

336
00:14:57,539 --> 00:15:04,709
really don't like is when people call

337
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:08,459
synthetic cannabinoids synthetic

338
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:10,740
marijuana or synthetic cannabis I have a

339
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,960
whole article written on this and I

340
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,870
encourage you to find it my name and if

341
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,879
you look up synthetic cannabinoids

342
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:20,250
synthetic Street cannabinoids or

343
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:25,470
so-called label the synthetic marijuana

344
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:28,019
is not cannabis is not marijuana it is

345
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:30,149
dangerous it should not be used it

346
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:33,059
should not be accessible and it is

347
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:35,549
widely accessible it is designed in the

348
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:37,829
lab it is designed by what I would call

349
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:40,199
evil scientists most of them are in

350
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:42,240
China and Eastern Europe it is

351
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:45,330
essentially putting chemicals together

352
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,909
and mixing them together to get to a

353
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:50,490
powder like form that looks like powder

354
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:53,250
and then sprinkle that powder like form

355
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:55,139
on the plant material which can be

356
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:58,440
tobacco or another material

357
00:15:55,139 --> 00:16:00,330
label it a spice or cush put incense on

358
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,670
it and put it in all of the head shops

359
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:04,830
and the government's cannot keep track

360
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:06,419
of it because new formulations new

361
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,190
variations of these cannabinoids

362
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:10,469
synthetic cannabinoids that are deadly

363
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,970
and dangerous are coming out and they're

364
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,220
being released with different labels

365
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,570
constantly there's probably over 70

366
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,210
different variations of synthetic

367
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:20,280
cannabinoids that are out there they are

368
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,710
addictive they're dangerous and they're

369
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:24,779
deadly and they have nothing to do with

370
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:28,259
cannabis

371
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:30,360
this is hemp it grows tall and most of

372
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:33,299
the high THC cannabis at least it is

373
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,690
bred to be below 3 meters in height or

374
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:35,689
so

375
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:43,209
and I have to tell you that I found this

376
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,830
picture recently this is 1930s in

377
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:47,530
Vilnius which is the capital of

378
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:50,050
Lithuania where Lithuanians and polish

379
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:52,659
it was then under the Polish control the

380
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:55,269
city of Vilnius not only grew this

381
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:57,069
fantastic ham grew this giant hemp that

382
00:16:55,269 --> 00:17:01,059
went all the way up to the four story

383
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:03,790
tall limits essentially but it was also

384
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:06,190
the first botanical and medicinal fiber

385
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:08,889
Institute that was opened in Vilnius in

386
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:11,289
Lithuania in 1930s one of the first ones

387
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:14,080
and it still maintains itself in Poznan

388
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:17,109
and has the second largest seed bank for

389
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:19,929
hemp and cannabis the the largest bank

390
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:22,809
for seeds for cannabis is in Russia so

391
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:26,500
have this in our history in Lithuania

392
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:29,409
it's not just Holland it's not just Bob

393
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,390
Marley before Bob Marley was born we

394
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:34,830
were already experimenting and we had a

395
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:39,040
research facility for cannabis and

396
00:17:34,829 --> 00:17:41,109
textiles for cannabis in Lithuania now

397
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,529
cannabis consists of a diverse set of

398
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:46,779
phyto compounds some people call it and

399
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:51,730
the mere Hamish one of the professors

400
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:52,420
it's my idol pounds 1001 molecules in

401
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:56,519
cannabis

402
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:59,860
there's over 115 phyto cannabinoids a

403
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:02,049
number of terpenes about 120 by the way

404
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:05,049
analytical labs the maximum they test

405
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:08,019
for I think is steep how is about 40

406
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:10,359
plus cannabinoid spectrum or terpene

407
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:13,420
spectrum that they test for so we still

408
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:16,500
don't know a lot about these other 60 to

409
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:19,120
80 terpenes that are found in cannabis

410
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,339
flavonoids as well as amino acids Omega

411
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:23,500
amino acid so it's a very valuable plant

412
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:26,019
after that from many different

413
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,549
perspectives not just from intoxication

414
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:29,519
and the other thing that's interesting

415
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:32,349
about the plant is that this plant

416
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:35,200
doesn't produce THC and doesn't produce

417
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:38,469
the CBD actually produces acidic

418
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,059
cannabinoids 95 percent or so all of the

419
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:43,930
cannabinoids that are expressed in the

420
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:46,329
plant our city cannabinoids such as THC

421
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:48,630
80 HCA's non-intoxicating

422
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:50,599
so cannabis plant is actually non

423
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:53,030
intoxicating

424
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:55,129
it is heating or processing that

425
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:58,490
cannabis plant or decarboxylation

426
00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:04,220
process that turns th scene THCA in t

427
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:08,089
THC CBD a into CBD and so on and th

428
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:10,690
season has the euphoric effect so THC

429
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:12,579
also is known as intoxicating agent

430
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:15,380
anti-inflammatory neuro protective

431
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:17,990
analgesic appetite stimulant antiemetic

432
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,090
anti-cancer is it all just good and

433
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:23,210
dandy does it work for everything and

434
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:23,779
make everybody happy no that's not the

435
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,970
case

436
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:27,980
cannabis is not for everybody cannabis

437
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:30,740
is not for every person it's not for

438
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:33,798
every patient cannabis can cause anxiety

439
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:36,829
can cause panic attacks can increase

440
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:38,990
heart rate there's low rate of addiction

441
00:19:36,829 --> 00:19:41,750
for cannabis or cannabis dependency we

442
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:44,839
can call it as well as this hyperemesis

443
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:48,079
syndrome from high use or constant

444
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:49,788
chronic use of high THC cannabinoids its

445
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:52,369
emerging it's this coughing and vomiting

446
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:55,369
like syndrome in the morning which

447
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:56,029
usually gets fixed by taking a hot

448
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:59,719
shower

449
00:19:56,029 --> 00:20:01,879
or using capsaicin from pepper which

450
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,500
binds to trip v1 receptors because

451
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,740
that's the mechanism that gets impaired

452
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:08,839
and hyperemesis syndrome so CBD is

453
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:12,200
really the therapeutic champion of

454
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:14,240
cannabinoids it actually counteracts

455
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,600
negative effects of THC so it can be

456
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,759
anti-anxiety and anti panic attacks it's

457
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:22,158
anti psychotic neuro protective anti

458
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:24,890
cancer that we can't addictions or lytic

459
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,990
anticonvulsant automatic analgesic it

460
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,030
does have negative effects fatigue and

461
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:31,099
drowsiness we also have to pay attention

462
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:33,798
to some of the latest literature from

463
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:37,189
epilepsy that suggests that both THC and

464
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:40,788
CBD could potentially be pro convulsant

465
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:43,700
in 10% of all of the studies okay so we

466
00:20:40,788 --> 00:20:46,158
have to be cautious of these things so

467
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:49,669
CBD cannabidiol what it does it blocks

468
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:52,370
enzymatic breakdown of the molecule FH

469
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:54,799
which synthesizes endocannabinoids so it

470
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:55,908
increases the production and presence of

471
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:58,029
the endocannabinoids

472
00:20:55,909 --> 00:21:01,220
it rapidly crosses blood-brain barrier

473
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:03,538
it's non psychoactive but I prefer to

474
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,839
use non intoxicating

475
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:08,839
because nicotine a psychoactive coffee

476
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:10,699
psychoactive everything is psychoactive

477
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:13,339
psychotropic is different or

478
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:16,259
intoxicating CBDs non-intoxicating

479
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:18,628
counteracts THC effects there's a lot of

480
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:21,839
evidence in human epilepsy with CBD and

481
00:21:18,628 --> 00:21:24,209
lots of diverse case studies using CBD

482
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:27,449
THC and also combination of THC and CBD

483
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:30,058
and what's emerging at least from

484
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:33,058
unpublished literature is that this

485
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:35,308
ratio of THC CBD and also from existing

486
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:39,058
drugs such as sativex which is one to

487
00:21:35,308 --> 00:21:42,418
one THC and CBD that this ratio of THC

488
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:47,278
CBD is also very important in different

489
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:49,109
applications now I urge you to look at

490
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:51,450
this health effects of cannabis and

491
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:53,668
cannabinoids it was published by the

492
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:56,190
National Academy of Sciences engineering

493
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:58,288
and medicine so we're the brightest

494
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,778
minds got together and reviewed all of

495
00:21:58,288 --> 00:22:03,778
the literature that's available and this

496
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:06,679
is what they decided not me there is

497
00:22:03,778 --> 00:22:13,169
conclusive or substantial evidence that

498
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:15,239
cannabis and cannabinoids cannabis in

499
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:17,038
this case is cannabis cannabinoids in

500
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:20,009
this case are synthetic pharmaceuticals

501
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:22,319
or plant-based pharmaceuticals such as

502
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:23,669
abba dialects or sativex conclusive

503
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:26,939
evidence for the treatment of chronic

504
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:28,769
pain antiemetic improvement of patient

505
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:32,159
reported multiple sclerosis spasticity

506
00:22:28,769 --> 00:22:33,839
simps symptoms oral cannabinoids there

507
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,460
is moderate evidence that cannabis or

508
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:36,988
cannabinoids are effective for improving

509
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,229
short-term sleep outcomes and

510
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:41,759
individuals with sleep disturbances now

511
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:43,739
you will see that there's also a lot of

512
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:46,048
limited evidence that cannabis and

513
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:48,569
cannabinoids are effective for THC for

514
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:50,220
Tourette syndrome limited evidence that

515
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:52,439
it is effective for traumatic brain

516
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,479
injury brain injury intracranial

517
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,950
hemorrhage limited evidence that

518
00:22:54,479 --> 00:23:00,450
cannabis are effective symptoms in a

519
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,848
fact that for improving symptoms

520
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:05,249
associated with dementia and so on so

521
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:08,249
there is definitely proof that it works

522
00:23:05,249 --> 00:23:10,348
there's also inconclusive evidence and I

523
00:23:08,249 --> 00:23:12,538
think again we just need more science

524
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:13,980
and more studies one thing to keep in

525
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:16,648
mind of course when we talk about

526
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:19,019
addiction is addiction is a very complex

527
00:23:16,648 --> 00:23:21,449
process it's a it's intertwined with

528
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:24,690
many different things but if we look

529
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:26,879
cannabis addiction cannabis has the

530
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:29,609
highest scores which is less addictive

531
00:23:26,878 --> 00:23:32,158
than caffeine according to Benowitz

532
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:35,189
ratings here so the higher the score the

533
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,679
less addictive is the substance and you

534
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:39,989
can see that nicotine is a lot more

535
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,450
addictive than marijuana and marijuana

536
00:23:39,989 --> 00:23:44,308
can be less addictive than caffeine

537
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:46,048
so yesterday politician said that

538
00:23:44,308 --> 00:23:50,418
cannabis should not be consumed this

539
00:23:46,048 --> 00:23:52,679
coffee and I just wanted to ask why

540
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:55,080
because it causes a different

541
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:59,129
intoxicating effect but not from the

542
00:23:55,079 --> 00:24:04,168
safety standpoint so from the safety

543
00:23:59,128 --> 00:24:07,829
standpoint marijuana here the lower the

544
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:11,038
number on this side and the lower the

545
00:24:07,829 --> 00:24:14,158
plant or a substance is on there on the

546
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:17,190
y-axis the lower it's on the y-axis the

547
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:20,369
less dependency potential there is the

548
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:22,889
lower the number on the x-axis that

549
00:24:20,368 --> 00:24:26,848
means that those okay so this is the

550
00:24:22,888 --> 00:24:29,069
active dose and lethal dose if it is one

551
00:24:26,848 --> 00:24:31,528
to one that means that active dose

552
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:34,048
something that eliminates your pain also

553
00:24:31,528 --> 00:24:37,710
kills you it's a lethal dose with

554
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:43,618
cannabis it's point zero zero one which

555
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:47,730
is thousand times of the active dose so

556
00:24:43,618 --> 00:24:49,949
if one rolled joint gets you high you

557
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:52,249
need to consume about a thousand in a

558
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:55,859
matter of few minutes which is

559
00:24:52,249 --> 00:24:58,528
impossible it is easier to do it with

560
00:24:55,858 --> 00:25:02,009
caffeine which is only a hundred times

561
00:24:58,528 --> 00:25:05,368
more of the effective dose and it is of

562
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:07,679
course a big problem with other drugs

563
00:25:05,368 --> 00:25:09,778
including opiates and morphine where

564
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,509
only ten times the dose including

565
00:25:09,778 --> 00:25:15,778
alcohol only ten times of the effective

566
00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:18,239
dose is lethal from safety perspective

567
00:25:15,778 --> 00:25:22,528
cannabis could be argued that it is

568
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:24,048
safer than caffeine now we have a lot of

569
00:25:22,528 --> 00:25:27,058
overdoses from

570
00:25:24,048 --> 00:25:30,180
benzodiazepines these are epilepsy drugs

571
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:32,129
mostly and you can see the rise in these

572
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:35,970
and there is thousands of deaths from

573
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:38,000
thousand deaths in 2000 to 2015

574
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:42,390
five to six thousand deaths from

575
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,910
benzodiazepines pharmaceuticals we have

576
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:46,200
very high morbidity and mortality rate

577
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:49,110
from opiates

578
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,210
so seventy three point eight of all

579
00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:54,809
prescription overdose deaths were due to

580
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:58,910
opioid pain relievers opr it's a study

581
00:25:54,809 --> 00:26:03,990
published by CDC OPR sales nonetheless

582
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:06,240
quadrupled between 99 and 2010 and it

583
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:09,509
cost insurance about seventy two point

584
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:13,039
four u.s. dollars in u.s. annually in

585
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:15,329
health care so this is a report 2011

586
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,339
since then I think we had a rise in

587
00:26:15,329 --> 00:26:19,559
opioid epidemic and I think these

588
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:23,309
numbers would probably look even worse

589
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:26,179
at this stage now deaths from cannabis

590
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:28,259
zero reported deaths from cannabis

591
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:31,049
opiates of course are used for the

592
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:32,879
treatment of chronic pains ear pain and

593
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:34,740
I looked at one of the studies a

594
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,280
prominent study a Journal of pain

595
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:41,279
research in 2017 a cross-sectional study

596
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:44,519
of 2,800 approximately individuals and

597
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:47,160
they showed that about 12 48 of these

598
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:49,289
individuals 48% respondents reported

599
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:52,019
using cannabis as a substitute for

600
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:54,680
prescription drugs and the most common

601
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:55,829
cases classes of drugs substituted are

602
00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:01,250
narcotics

603
00:26:55,829 --> 00:27:04,740
about 36% ng Linux or benzyl taxes and

604
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:07,170
depressants this is what the patients

605
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,120
report themselves so it's not a very

606
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:11,640
stringent study but it is something that

607
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:13,889
is being reported self-reported by

608
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,570
patients and it is looking really

609
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:17,670
substantial this is not the only study

610
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:19,559
but I don't have time to go over other

611
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:22,019
pain studies there's another pain study

612
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:24,450
in Canada that showed a similar result

613
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:27,420
of people dropping opiates and switching

614
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:30,059
to cannabinoids now in the plant again

615
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:31,980
we not only have cannabinoids different

616
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:34,259
set of cannabinoids but we also have

617
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,000
terpenes terpenes are the aromatic

618
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:37,859
lipophilic molecules is what gives

619
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,900
cannabis a different smell a different

620
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:42,359
strain of cannabis smells differently

621
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,030
one may smell like lemon because it has

622
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:45,549
lye money

623
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:49,119
another may smell like lavender because

624
00:27:45,549 --> 00:27:52,029
it has wine Elul as the terpene in the

625
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:54,819
plant these aromatic molecules they

626
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:57,069
easily cross blood-brain barrier so when

627
00:27:54,819 --> 00:27:59,559
you inhale terpenes through your nose it

628
00:27:57,069 --> 00:28:00,700
actually goes into your olfactory system

629
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:03,399
and crosses through the blood-brain

630
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,799
barrier it is not just smell it actually

631
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,560
has a logical and physiological effect

632
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:10,359
and if we look here D lineman E is being

633
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:13,329
used as potent anti-cancer anxiolytics

634
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:16,000
and immuno stimulation immunostimulant

635
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:19,509
beta Mersin which is found in hoppin

636
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,549
mango is potent anti-inflammatory alpha

637
00:28:19,509 --> 00:28:24,789
pi9 is at the top cholinesterase

638
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:27,519
inhibitor or sin which acts in the same

639
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:29,649
way as Alzheimer's medications do which

640
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,960
are at sattell cholinesterase inhibitors

641
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:34,900
for the most part except for memantine

642
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:37,200
and line Alou has analgesic anxiolytics

643
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:39,640
and anti-inflammatory anticonvulsant

644
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,789
properties so these molecules are

645
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,259
biological and physiologically active

646
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:45,819
better carrier filling is probably one

647
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:48,670
of my favorites it has anti-inflammatory

648
00:28:45,819 --> 00:28:52,149
and gastric cytoprotective activities as

649
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:54,820
well as it serves a Seabee to selective

650
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:56,560
agonist these terpenes are not just

651
00:28:54,819 --> 00:28:58,750
found in cannabis and beta carrier

652
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,389
filling is very prominent in hops for

653
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:04,509
example it is also very prominent in

654
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:09,040
Lithuanian hemp and the products

655
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:10,779
actually that we we have here made from

656
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,029
Lithuanian hemp I'll tell you about them

657
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:14,889
in a minute they're loaded naturally

658
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:16,539
with better carrier filling so there are

659
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:18,280
certain strains that will have a lot of

660
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:20,859
better cure filling which is CBT

661
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:24,369
receptor agonist again it's involved in

662
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:27,699
mune system modulation and it's very

663
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:30,129
important to keep that in mind so

664
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:32,110
because of these different smells we

665
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:35,080
have what we call the anther artifact so

666
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:37,449
first you smell things and it has a

667
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:39,369
certain Association for you it's a

668
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:41,289
pleasant association it's a good memory

669
00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:42,339
or maybe it's something that you should

670
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:46,839
stay away from

671
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:49,990
so first u.s. tomato of cannabis flower

672
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:51,549
especially by smell and by look but it

673
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:53,319
doesn't mean that that's going either

674
00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:55,240
physiological effect that it causes

675
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:56,710
because it all depends on the components

676
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,919
and molecules that are found in

677
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:02,620
cannabis and their groupings now the

678
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:05,169
names are kind of interesting this has

679
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:07,569
been challenged gorilla glue I think

680
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:10,270
it's out now let's be really glue off

681
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:12,038
the market but you know what I find

682
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:15,339
really interesting and I think it hurts

683
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:18,788
the market is when fun names introduce

684
00:30:15,339 --> 00:30:20,740
like purple monkey balls and I think

685
00:30:18,788 --> 00:30:22,690
that that's kind of a wrong approach and

686
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:25,210
that's what makes gifts cannabis

687
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:27,730
industry a little bit of a bad rap and

688
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:29,558
that's that's a problem I think the

689
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:31,240
strains should indicate something about

690
00:30:29,558 --> 00:30:34,148
the condition something about the field

691
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,919
least in some way associate with the

692
00:30:34,148 --> 00:30:38,469
source with the location where it was

693
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,870
grown but not just some crazy name

694
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:44,710
because a lot of younger people would go

695
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:47,408
for it and I think it just for everybody

696
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:50,259
so cannabis entourage effect comes from

697
00:30:47,409 --> 00:30:52,450
the sum total of synergistic as well as

698
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:55,829
antagonistic effects remember CBD

699
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:59,558
slightly antagonistic to THC effects

700
00:30:55,829 --> 00:31:01,028
multiple targets throughout the body by

701
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:03,308
a collection of terpenes and when

702
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:05,589
terpenes and cannabinoids come together

703
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:07,990
they kind of a work in unison in one

704
00:31:05,589 --> 00:31:10,058
fashion they facilitate absorption or

705
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:12,099
delivery of active ingredients the

706
00:31:10,058 --> 00:31:15,099
counteract or minimize adverse side

707
00:31:12,099 --> 00:31:17,769
effects and whole plant vital

708
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:20,798
cannabinoid extract compared to phyto

709
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:23,019
cannabinoid isolates will have a lot of

710
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:25,058
phyto cannabinoids and the isolate is

711
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:28,148
just a single fighter cannabinoid that

712
00:31:25,058 --> 00:31:29,918
has been isolated now and the

713
00:31:28,148 --> 00:31:32,949
cannabinoids and cannabinoids are not

714
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,140
just found in cannabis so an and amide

715
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:37,360
and all the amide are funded chocolate

716
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:39,159
you should challenge every person that

717
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:41,199
doesn't know about cannabinoids or

718
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:43,778
cannabis by telling them do you know

719
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:47,110
that you eight cannabinoids today or

720
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:49,690
last night I see no I didn't how can I

721
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:51,788
have done that I didn't do it I don't do

722
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:53,470
these things but you eat chocolate right

723
00:31:51,788 --> 00:31:55,629
you love chocolate so you got some

724
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:58,899
cannabinoids in it and people are very

725
00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:00,760
surprised truffles also having the

726
00:31:58,898 --> 00:32:02,500
cannabinoids so we're people are crazy

727
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:04,929
about certain foods people will pay a

728
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,909
lot of money for truffles a lot of money

729
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:09,820
for chocolate and is it all just because

730
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:12,940
of the taste I have to wonder

731
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:15,489
so now we come to the human body in

732
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:17,739
human body processes this information in

733
00:32:15,489 --> 00:32:21,069
different ways and there is a multitude

734
00:32:17,739 --> 00:32:23,288
of products that go through the human

735
00:32:21,069 --> 00:32:25,839
body and so let's talk about different

736
00:32:23,288 --> 00:32:27,849
products and maybe I'm going to jump a

737
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:29,888
couple of slides if you don't mind we

738
00:32:27,849 --> 00:32:31,898
can talk about now that we understand

739
00:32:29,888 --> 00:32:34,538
different components such as isolates

740
00:32:31,898 --> 00:32:39,158
such as extracts we want to reconstruct

741
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:42,638
cannabis into houses into CBD oil into

742
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:45,039
protein powder into food and everything

743
00:32:42,638 --> 00:32:47,048
that cannabis has to offer so let's look

744
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:49,388
at these slides and make sure we

745
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:50,858
understand this that smoking cannabis is

746
00:32:49,388 --> 00:32:53,769
probably not the best thing actually

747
00:32:50,858 --> 00:32:55,598
vaporizing cannabis is better all

748
00:32:53,769 --> 00:32:58,089
ingestion of cannabis you have

749
00:32:55,598 --> 00:33:00,128
sublingually and swallowing you have

750
00:32:58,089 --> 00:33:02,259
topical liniments of cannabis and you

751
00:33:00,128 --> 00:33:04,238
also have suppositories they all have

752
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:06,729
very different effect in the use of

753
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:08,950
these cannabinoids and cannabis products

754
00:33:06,729 --> 00:33:11,379
will have a very different effect on the

755
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:13,598
individual and that's important to keep

756
00:33:11,378 --> 00:33:15,699
in mind another important thing to keep

757
00:33:13,598 --> 00:33:19,058
in mind and warn ourselves about is

758
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:22,598
metabolism so THC gets metabolized and

759
00:33:19,058 --> 00:33:24,398
it gets metabolized into 1108 Delta 9

760
00:33:22,598 --> 00:33:27,249
THC and then through the secondary

761
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:30,428
metabolism it turns into Delta 9 THC 11

762
00:33:27,249 --> 00:33:32,379
oleic acid this 11 Olek acid has nothing

763
00:33:30,429 --> 00:33:35,048
to do with acidic cannabinoids that are

764
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:37,388
found in the plant but this 11 oeq acid

765
00:33:35,048 --> 00:33:39,999
is actually a more stronger and toxicant

766
00:33:37,388 --> 00:33:42,579
than THC and that's why people have

767
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:44,558
problems with edibles when they're used

768
00:33:42,579 --> 00:33:46,509
to inhaling or smoking cannabis and

769
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:49,058
getting the effect from that immediately

770
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:51,788
they expect the same when they try there

771
00:33:49,058 --> 00:33:54,460
first edible side the airport in Denver

772
00:33:51,788 --> 00:33:56,348
and half an hour later they said well

773
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:58,598
I'm not feeling anything so let me pop a

774
00:33:56,348 --> 00:34:01,689
couple more and by the time they pop a

775
00:33:58,598 --> 00:34:04,118
couple more this 11 Olek acid is already

776
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:06,609
built up and it is now acting as a

777
00:34:04,118 --> 00:34:09,068
double or triple intoxicant on top of

778
00:34:06,608 --> 00:34:11,019
the new THC coming into your body with

779
00:34:09,068 --> 00:34:13,509
additional gummy bear candies that you

780
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:15,969
consumed so that's very important to

781
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:19,149
keep in mind that the metabolism of the

782
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:21,189
body is very important so the other way

783
00:34:19,148 --> 00:34:23,529
that we view cannabis is mostly we talk

784
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:25,630
about medicinal cannabis and smoking

785
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:27,630
I believe that cannabis and cannabinoids

786
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:31,750
will find their way into the food chain

787
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:35,409
they'll find their way into the plates

788
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:39,039
and micro dosing of cannabis can be

789
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:40,510
found in the feed animal feed and that

790
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:43,000
animal feed and through the whole

791
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:45,370
process it can find itself on our food

792
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,710
supply chain on our tables

793
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:49,839
therefore to reconstruct cannabis we

794
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,519
have to understand and reconstruct the

795
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,829
products we have to understand the state

796
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:55,300
of the under cannabinoid system

797
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:58,059
metabolic profiles psychological state

798
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:00,910
drug and drug interactions we have to

799
00:34:58,059 --> 00:35:02,980
create products and then know that

800
00:35:00,909 --> 00:35:05,559
recommending these products the doctors

801
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:07,300
go by start low go slow philosophy that

802
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:09,519
you have to know those who just safety

803
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,620
efficacy pollutants that are present

804
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:13,659
there undoubtedly third party test

805
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:15,579
results and clinical studies before

806
00:35:13,659 --> 00:35:17,619
these parties can find their way into

807
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:20,110
doctors nurses health care practitioners

808
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:24,039
and be recommended either's food food

809
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:26,500
supplement or medical cannabis products

810
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:28,110
so all of these are very important now

811
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:31,300
we also have to know that there are

812
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:32,430
contraindications that cannabis again is

813
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,840
not for everybody

814
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:37,419
psychosis use of strains with minimal or

815
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:39,610
no THC content is recommended and

816
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:41,500
bipolar disease there's an association

817
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:44,140
between cannabis misuse and earlier

818
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:47,110
onset of bipolar eight percent of

819
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:49,569
general population is cannabis allergic

820
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:51,070
and there is a multitude of drug and

821
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:53,410
drug interactions that happen through

822
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:54,730
metabolism with cytochrome this is

823
00:35:53,409 --> 00:35:57,129
something very important this is

824
00:35:54,730 --> 00:36:00,070
metabolism antiepileptic drugs that is

825
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:01,840
taken from project CBD and basically

826
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:04,420
what these lines are showing that if you

827
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:07,390
combine any one of these bars any one of

828
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:09,280
these drugs with CBD the amount of that

829
00:36:07,389 --> 00:36:12,069
from a suitable drug in the blood can

830
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,960
mostly increase in some cases it will

831
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:16,390
decrease but in many cases it will

832
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:19,420
increase and that's important to know

833
00:36:16,389 --> 00:36:22,809
because you're essentially by occupying

834
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:27,220
the cytochrome p which metabolizes CBD

835
00:36:22,809 --> 00:36:29,349
and gives CBD priority now does not

836
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:30,879
metabolize the pharmaceutical drugs

837
00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:32,739
therefore there is a buildup of

838
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,530
pharmaceutical substances in the body

839
00:36:32,739 --> 00:36:37,149
that can be twice three times the

840
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:40,510
concentrations can

841
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:45,250
- serious problems liver problems liver

842
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:47,230
compromise as well as other effects now

843
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:49,389
cannabis of course we have different

844
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:51,278
preparations the best way to consume

845
00:36:49,389 --> 00:36:53,429
cannabis is through inhaling is

846
00:36:51,278 --> 00:36:56,079
vaporization it's control temperature

847
00:36:53,429 --> 00:36:59,169
cannabis flower vapor and pan can be

848
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:02,589
used for vaporization concentrate oil or

849
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:04,869
wax wax vaporization is often preferred

850
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:06,429
and that's because trichomes that

851
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:08,019
contain the cannabinoids and the

852
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:10,480
terpenes that I told you they will melt

853
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:14,019
away before the plant matter or the

854
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,750
leaves and the buds will burn there is

855
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:19,088
less carbon monoxide heat and there is

856
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:21,608
no smoke and somebody will say why would

857
00:37:19,088 --> 00:37:23,108
you ever want to inhale cannabis let me

858
00:37:21,608 --> 00:37:25,659
ask you this question where do we have

859
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:30,308
the most surface area to absorb things

860
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:33,429
into our bodies lungs the second place

861
00:37:30,309 --> 00:37:36,309
is suppositories anal vaginal they

862
00:37:33,429 --> 00:37:38,139
bypass the metabolism of the liver they

863
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:40,420
get absorbed directly through the lungs

864
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:42,308
into the bloodstream or into the

865
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:44,139
bloodstream through the suppositories

866
00:37:42,309 --> 00:37:45,940
and there immediately into the blood

867
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:48,400
where they can cross blood-brain barrier

868
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:50,318
therefore inhaling something can be very

869
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,900
helpful for people that suffer from

870
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:55,269
certain conditions we also have to

871
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:57,099
understand that there are isolates that

872
00:37:55,269 --> 00:38:00,489
look like powder and it will almost look

873
00:37:57,099 --> 00:38:02,528
like a synthetic right but it is not it

874
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:05,709
is not a synthetic it is actually an

875
00:38:02,528 --> 00:38:07,298
isolate from the plant that's what a lot

876
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,559
of people ask me wait a second so it's

877
00:38:07,298 --> 00:38:10,659
isolate the same as synthetic

878
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:12,069
cannabinoids where you will you take and

879
00:38:10,659 --> 00:38:14,618
mix things together and then you get

880
00:38:12,068 --> 00:38:19,179
this powder no it's processing of the

881
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:20,680
plant is extracting the plant separating

882
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:24,278
the molecules where you can get an

883
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:27,129
isolate less such a CBD or THC isolate

884
00:38:24,278 --> 00:38:29,289
some of the products are all that means

885
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:31,358
that there is non decarboxylated and

886
00:38:29,289 --> 00:38:33,339
they will contain a Siddha cannabinoids

887
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:35,500
and many products are being

888
00:38:33,338 --> 00:38:37,420
decarboxylated so it's important to pay

889
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,010
attention are these raw products or they

890
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:42,460
have been decarboxylated you're getting

891
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:46,210
a different profile of the cannabinoids

892
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:48,429
in these products there's many oils that

893
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:49,449
are being produced most of the tinctures

894
00:38:48,429 --> 00:38:52,598
though but

895
00:38:49,449 --> 00:38:55,299
refer to tinctures with alcohol but many

896
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:57,970
oils are being used as carriers for

897
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:00,550
either isolates or for the extracts

898
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:04,389
themselves such as olive oil coconut oil

899
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:07,480
hemp seed oil and glycerin and as well

900
00:39:04,389 --> 00:39:09,429
there is form of capsules that can be

901
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,588
found so many different products many

902
00:39:09,429 --> 00:39:13,480
different uses you have to know the test

903
00:39:11,588 --> 00:39:15,909
results you have to know what is inside

904
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,159
the products you have to know where

905
00:39:15,909 --> 00:39:20,379
they're sourced where they came from how

906
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:23,409
they were made and how they found their

907
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:25,690
way on the Shelf so for us to have

908
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:27,429
individualized cannabinoid preparations

909
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:29,800
which i think is really necessary they

910
00:39:27,429 --> 00:39:31,690
have to be individualized for a certain

911
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,430
condition and they have to be

912
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:34,929
individualized for a certain individual

913
00:39:33,429 --> 00:39:36,549
because that individual with a certain

914
00:39:34,929 --> 00:39:39,118
condition may be taking different drugs

915
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:42,220
may be having a different metabolic

916
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:44,740
turnover so we need to standardize the

917
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:46,358
grows and the product to standardize the

918
00:39:44,739 --> 00:39:48,669
grows the biggest challenge is you have

919
00:39:46,358 --> 00:39:50,858
to have complete control of inputs that

920
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:52,869
is going into the plant and complete

921
00:39:50,858 --> 00:39:55,150
control of outputs you have to scan the

922
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:57,970
plant measure the plant so that you can

923
00:39:55,150 --> 00:40:01,030
capture the same output chemical output

924
00:39:57,969 --> 00:40:03,399
of the plant cycle after cycle which is

925
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:06,099
a big challenge to my knowledge nobody

926
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:09,068
has done it if I am wrong please correct

927
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:11,019
me but there is no standardized output

928
00:40:09,068 --> 00:40:13,659
from the the same strain grown by the

929
00:40:11,019 --> 00:40:15,900
same grower the same conditions to

930
00:40:13,659 --> 00:40:15,899
growth

931
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,920
thirty forty percent in the composition

932
00:40:19,009 --> 00:40:24,108
of terpenes especially terpenes are

933
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,028
evolved by stress so it's a natural way

934
00:40:24,108 --> 00:40:28,068
for the plant to protect itself and

935
00:40:26,028 --> 00:40:30,259
terpenes and cannabinoids they fluctuate

936
00:40:28,068 --> 00:40:32,599
during the girl's cycle they go up and

937
00:40:30,259 --> 00:40:35,150
down so it's important to capture the

938
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:38,088
part of the cycle and the part of doubt

939
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:40,068
that is standardized what you saw in

940
00:40:38,088 --> 00:40:41,449
your previous growth cycle so now you

941
00:40:40,068 --> 00:40:43,338
have the standardized grow and

942
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:44,960
standardized plant now you have to

943
00:40:43,338 --> 00:40:46,849
standardize the products make sure that

944
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,539
the products are always the same you

945
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:52,278
have to then analyze databases and here

946
00:40:50,539 --> 00:40:54,019
that you trace the patients that are

947
00:40:52,278 --> 00:40:56,088
using are they getting good effects or

948
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:57,709
not so analyzing databases are going to

949
00:40:56,088 --> 00:41:00,170
be very important gathering that

950
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:02,389
information we have to pay attention to

951
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:05,809
liver metabolism and compromise of liver

952
00:41:02,389 --> 00:41:09,710
for high levels of CBD can compromise

953
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:11,298
liver function milligrams of CBD taken

954
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:14,389
together with some of these anti

955
00:41:11,298 --> 00:41:18,949
epileptic drugs warfarin for example

956
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:22,940
will increase also but a blood thinner

957
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:25,118
and also we have to think about a lot of

958
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:27,349
drugs that we're using essentially so

959
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,630
liberalism is very important and then

960
00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:32,660
drug and drug interactions as the liver

961
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:37,249
metabolizes these is also very important

962
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:38,899
so in my opinion science anything goes

963
00:41:37,248 --> 00:41:40,548
in science and you can really pave the

964
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:43,039
way of the future you can have bright

965
00:41:40,548 --> 00:41:45,288
ideas you can dive in the deepest oceans

966
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:48,019
or look at the highest mountains to find

967
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:49,640
and pave the way and there is a facts

968
00:41:48,018 --> 00:41:52,098
and these facts need to be taken into

969
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:54,679
consideration their industry needs

970
00:41:52,099 --> 00:41:56,119
education industry needs a lot of

971
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:58,788
Education I think that the biggest

972
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:00,289
bottleneck in Germany right now is the

973
00:41:58,789 --> 00:42:02,269
healthcare practitioners and medical

974
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:04,819
doctors because they do not understand

975
00:42:02,268 --> 00:42:07,278
the products that are in the pharmacies

976
00:42:04,818 --> 00:42:08,900
they do understand why certain strains

977
00:42:07,278 --> 00:42:11,469
should be used over another certain

978
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,369
strain why may be low THC should be

979
00:42:11,469 --> 00:42:15,889
recommended with somebody that has

980
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:18,528
inclinations or indications of psychosis

981
00:42:15,889 --> 00:42:20,838
so there has to be a major D Sigma ties

982
00:42:18,528 --> 00:42:24,139
ation of cannabis which can only happen

983
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:26,960
through education and of course in

984
00:42:24,139 --> 00:42:29,719
medicine to reach that medical point to

985
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,269
standardized the can ASSU tickles and

986
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:33,029
chemistry

987
00:42:30,269 --> 00:42:35,880
are different from pharmaceuticals it's

988
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:37,980
a dime change so we all have to get used

989
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,050
to the reality and how to interpret this

990
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:43,199
paradigm change in the existing systems

991
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:45,630
so hemp cannabis saves lives and heals

992
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:48,509
people and animals so what are you

993
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:50,250
waiting for and it's not just for you of

994
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:50,940
course most of you here know what you're

995
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:53,849
waiting for

996
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:56,250
but what are other people waiting for

997
00:42:53,849 --> 00:42:58,710
what are other politicians waiting for

998
00:42:56,250 --> 00:43:02,159
the facts are in front of them the

999
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:03,929
reality is in front of them wanted to

1000
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:06,389
say is meetings like this are really

1001
00:43:03,929 --> 00:43:09,618
great because still when we were at this

1002
00:43:06,389 --> 00:43:12,269
meeting we came together with people

1003
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:15,119
that came from different parts of the

1004
00:43:12,269 --> 00:43:17,460
world we met outside the meeting then we

1005
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,160
met inside the meeting and I'm happy to

1006
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:23,070
tell you that version of this meeting

1007
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:25,109
dear girl is a new brand that our

1008
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:27,150
company that the Taurus is launching its

1009
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:28,950
Florence and if you stop by you can see

1010
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:32,369
the variety of products that we produce

1011
00:43:28,949 --> 00:43:35,669
with hemp a CBD in the United States as

1012
00:43:32,369 --> 00:43:37,858
well as in Lithuania in Europe so these

1013
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:40,170
meetings and Alex organizing these

1014
00:43:37,858 --> 00:43:42,539
meetings and all of the guys and the

1015
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:45,539
ladies promoting the networking is

1016
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:49,170
really valuable I'm very happy to be

1017
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:52,139
here again and I think I here because we

1018
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:54,119
formed the Restonic partnership and it's

1019
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:55,949
also nice when you find the right people

1020
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:57,480
and the right partners where you can

1021
00:43:55,949 --> 00:44:00,480
move things forward in the desired

1022
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:05,608
fashion so these are our partners for

1023
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,929
Florence Mehta tours and thank you very

1024
00:44:05,608 --> 00:44:11,099
much for your attention one more time

1025
00:44:06,929 --> 00:44:19,440
dr. Jay Z yes sir deep we have time

1026
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:23,518
maybe for one one question question

1027
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,519
maybe closer to me

1028
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:40,500
dr. Z Z why does some people not feel

1029
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:40,500
CBD immediately I've come across

1030
00:44:41,909 --> 00:44:47,489
right away what is it people that need

1031
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:53,039
that there are they require different

1032
00:44:47,489 --> 00:44:55,079
dosages so III know you as a person that

1033
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:55,800
asks the toughest questions in the

1034
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:59,509
audience

1035
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,510
and this is

1036
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:05,179
perhaps my answer would be what are you

1037
00:45:01,969 --> 00:45:07,279
supposed to feel with CBD because people

1038
00:45:05,179 --> 00:45:10,608
are used to feeling intoxicating effect

1039
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:13,310
with THC so the first few times they

1040
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:15,259
they take it and there's a certain

1041
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:18,858
feeling maybe I should be feeling

1042
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:22,160
something like high or intoxicated but

1043
00:45:18,858 --> 00:45:26,000
that's not the case and if you have no

1044
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:30,319
problems if you have no anxiety if you

1045
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:34,760
have no pain if you have no nausea acid

1046
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:37,430
reflux or gastric problems you may not

1047
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:39,920
feel that effective CBD interestingly

1048
00:45:37,429 --> 00:45:42,409
enough the doctors in the United States

1049
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:45,200
are now suggested prophylactic use of

1050
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:47,868
CBD every day of about 3 to 5 milligrams

1051
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:51,019
a day again for what reason

1052
00:45:47,869 --> 00:45:53,480
potentially to tame the the increase in

1053
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:55,759
inflammation and the aging that happens

1054
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,380
just normally in our bodies so it's a

1055
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,050
great question I'm sorry I don't have a

1056
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:02,809
definitive answer for you on the other

1057
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:03,950
hand it definitely probably has to do

1058
00:46:02,809 --> 00:46:05,719
with metabolism

1059
00:46:03,949 --> 00:46:07,899
some people might metabolize it much

1060
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:11,000
faster so they need higher doses and

1061
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:13,670
also I had a similar question where

1062
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,519
somebody's me on a smoked THC I can't

1063
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:18,349
get high and I smoke so much of it and I

1064
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:20,690
smoke a concentrated and still can't get

1065
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:22,549
high and then I said well did you ever

1066
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:24,619
get high and said oh yeah I had these

1067
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:26,750
edibles and knocked me out and it

1068
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:31,539
occurred to me that maybe the receptor

1069
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:33,920
that that lady had is not properly

1070
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:36,590
structured to teach see doesn't bind to

1071
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,750
that receptor but 11 all week teetsi

1072
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:42,140
acid the secondary metabolites of liver

1073
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:45,349
now has a huge intoxicating effect on

1074
00:46:42,139 --> 00:46:46,909
the person so thank you thank you thank

1075
00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:48,829
you very much more time dr. Jay Z I'm

1076
00:46:46,909 --> 00:46:52,059
sure they'd be happy to answer more

1077
00:46:48,829 --> 00:46:52,059
questions hallway
