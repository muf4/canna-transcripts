proud to say that in the past year we

have made significant strides towards a

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,120
more modern European cannabis regulation

23
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,920
something that was not possible in the

24
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:08,840
last decade due to various reasons and

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,879
interests of course it is also result of

26
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,600
developments in our country as well as

27
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:16,239
in Europe and in the world after Decades

28
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:19,118
of rejection Europe has fully restored

29
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:22,078
cannabis's legal status as a medicine

30
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:25,239
this year with the historic inclusion of

31
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:26,279
the Cannabis flower and canabidol in the

and medical professionals have

38
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,519
increasingly been calling for the

39
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,520
regulation of cannabis for medical

40
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,438
purposes medical cannabis use is topic

41
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,438
that is

42
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:52,239
gaining uh more attention worldwide as

43
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,519
cannabis represents a real supportive

44
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,158
medicine for many people facing

45
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:59,959
conditions such as chronic pain epilepsy

46
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:01,479
multiple sclerosis and the side sight

47
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:04,359
effects of

48
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:07,039
chemotherapy why would we deny patients

49
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:09,878
and scientific Community Access to

50
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,640
Resource that could improve the lives of

51
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:14,759
many by fully regulating the use of

52
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,399
cannabis for medical purposes we will

53
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:19,919
provide Slovenian patients with easier

54
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,879
safer and more accessible paths to this

55
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:26,799
form of therapy currently due to the ban

56
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:29,399
of cannabis cultivation we are dependent

57
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,080
on importing these products which limits

58
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,680
access treatment and raises

59
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,120
costs however since cannabis is still

60
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,239
highly criminalized here in Slovenia and

61
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,519
the fact that there are numerous often

62
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,480
conflicting expert and non-expert

63
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:47,840
opinions about its use we decided to ask

64
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,639
slovenians about their views on this

65
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,000
issue through the use of

66
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:54,439
referendum as you may know in June of

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,239
this year we voted in referendum on two

68
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:59,878
questions the cultivation and processing

69
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,560
of cannabis for medical purposes and

70
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:05,359
cultivation and possession for personal

71
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,799
use voters approved the cultivation and

72
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,120
proess of cannabis for medical purposes

73
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,080
with

74
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,959
66.5% of the

75
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,640
vote the results of the vote on personal

76
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:19,519
use were closer with

77
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:22,279
51.5% voters voting in

78
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,039
favor based on the will of Voters we

79
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,959
immediately began working with the

80
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:29,798
parliament members and esteemed experts

81
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,680
to draft a modern European outline for

82
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,920
legislation on these two issues we

83
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,560
established a group of experts from the

84
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:40,359
fields of medicine Pharmacy

85
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,519
biotechnology legal Sciences with the

86
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,159
goal for ensuring multi-disciplinary

87
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:48,158
approach to resolving cannabis release

88
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:50,878
related issues and ensuring that the new

89
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:53,280
legislation is professionally prepared

90
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:55,759
consistent and aligned with the latest

91
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,400
findings both domestic and foreign

92
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:01,078
experts in the legisl legislative

93
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,280
approach we will follow the examples of

94
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,680
you member states that have already made

95
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,280
the necessary changes in their

96
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,480
legislation slovenia's current uh

97
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,438
legislation does at least in theory

98
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:15,158
allow the use of cannabis products for

99
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:18,120
medical purposes but this has never

100
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:20,120
truly come to fruition in practice this

101
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,478
is evident through its very limited

102
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,759
scope and numerous obstacles among other

103
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:28,478
things the position of agency for

104
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,600
medicinal products and medical devices

105
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:33,839
also poses a problem as it claims that

106
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,879
the use of cannabis for medical purposes

107
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:41,159
is permitted in accordance with medicine

108
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:44,560
act pH Pharmacy practice act as well as

109
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,880
regulations which is correct however

110
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,519
agency argues that that due to the lack

111
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:52,038
of prescription guidelines except for

112
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:54,359
terminally ill patients the prescription

113
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:57,240
of cannabinoids for other medical

114
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,879
condition is not permissible in our

115
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,879
opinion this tense is incorrect as there

116
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:04,000
are extensive prescription guidelines

117
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:06,399
prepared by countries with comparable

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,038
levels of health care for instance

119
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:12,159
Netherlands United Kingdom Canada

120
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:15,038
Australia and so on here I must also

121
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,280
emphasize the past un just disregard for

122
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,800
professional guidelines prepared by the

123
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:22,959
pioneer of cannabis treatment in

124
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:26,000
Slovenia oncologist Dr yina

125
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,918
Cher with the updated legal regulation

126
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,519
we will also accelerate scientific

127
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:33,279
research in this field Ian research

128
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:35,519
institutes have immense potential which

129
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,679
we are not utilizing enough instead of

130
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,478
straightening domestic science and

131
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,800
developing Innovative medical approaches

132
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:45,478
we are dependent on imported products

133
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,120
which are not only a missed opportunity

134
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:50,279
but also hinders progress in scientific

135
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,319
understanding of the risk and benefits

136
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:53,879
of

137
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:56,000
cannabinoids it is a fact that cannabis

138
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:58,399
use was never sucess successfully

139
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,918
prevented by prohibition rather the

140
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,239
opposite is true therefore we must

141
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:07,159
appropriately adapt our legislation in

142
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,478
more sensible and pragmatic way with

143
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,680
appropriate legal regulation we can

144
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:14,120
better protect patients from the black

145
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,038
market and educate young people about

146
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,160
its

147
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,959
use the new legislation must therefore

148
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,759
comprehensively regul the field of

149
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:25,519
medical cannabis from cultivation

150
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:28,000
processing possession and distribution

151
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:32,079
to prescribing methods as well as Define

152
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,279
the limits of using can for personal use

153
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,198
as far as personal Calibus is concerned

154
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:38,359
the experience of other countries

155
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:41,199
clearly shows that sensible regulation

156
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:44,080
is crucial instead of risking the

157
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,080
consequences of unregulated Market which

158
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,478
is often associated with illegal

159
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,800
activities and dangerous products

160
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,240
legalization would reduce health risk

161
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,680
and most importantly more efficiently

162
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,360
more efficiently protect young people

163
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,478
with full responsibility we are

164
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:04,400
fulfilling our prom and preparing a new

165
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:06,478
modern legislation in light with other

166
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:10,399
developed European countries which will

167
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:12,519
allow our CI to legally access safe and

168
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:15,079
professionally supported cannabis

169
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:17,669
