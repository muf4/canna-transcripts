about medical marijuana reform and adult

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,070
use cannabis legalization what's the

13
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:34,799
sense of where America is at America is

14
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,380
more United around this issue than those

15
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,299
in Washington would have you believe

16
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:42,120
it's an amazing thing and really hope

17
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,439
inspiring actually to see how you know

18
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:44,788
at my town halls I'm here in New

19
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,409
Hampshire right now we're holding town

20
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,270
hall meetings every single day we've

21
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:51,390
held over about a hundred and twenty

22
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,719
town halls here for the last year and at

23
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,500
every single one we have Democrats

24
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,120
Republicans independents and

25
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,500
libertarians coming together talking

26
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:03,259
about the issues of the day in this

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:06,478
upcoming election and this issue around

28
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:08,640
legalizing cannabis is one that has such

29
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,010
incredible cross partisan support and

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,769
that people in some of the most rural

31
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:16,380
conservative towns here in New Hampshire

32
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:19,590
also support the frustration here in New

33
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:23,219
Hampshire is that even as it is the Live

34
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:26,009
Free or Die State it has still the most

35
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:28,798
restrictive laws relating to cannabis

36
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:32,040
even medical cannabis in a neighborhood

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,250
of you know Massachusetts Vermont and

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,200
other states that have have done so much

39
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:41,340
more to legalize and ease people's

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,740
access to cannabis we held a panel here

41
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,140
recently a presidential forum that we

42
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:48,599
hosted and brought in different leaders

43
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,489
here legislative leaders there's a woman

44
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:52,408
who's a nurse who is advocating for the

45
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:55,968
legalization of cannabis with the nurses

46
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:59,759
Network there's a woman who is on a

47
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:02,459
medical board here who herself needed

48
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,319
medical cannabis and whose add the

49
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:06,179
citizens advocate for this so they

50
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,909
brought an incredible treasure trove of

51
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,770
real life experiences and the real

52
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:12,750
challenges that folks in New England are

53
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,830
facing which I think are reflective of a

54
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,050
lot of the challenges

55
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,900
that we're facing across the country but

56
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:22,020
the hopeful thing is that this is not a

57
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,240
right versus left issue this is for most

58
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,900
Americans it's a question of freedom and

59
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:32,340
fairness and choice and for people to be

60
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:34,590
able to access this plant as medicine to

61
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,719
regain their lives to achieve wellness

62
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,539
and in many cases even as we're dealing

63
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:42,270
with the opioid crisis to save people's

64
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:45,419
lives medical medical marijuana is

65
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,219
polling at 91% in America right now I

66
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:51,149
don't even think clean water polls at

67
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:53,699
91% you've been in Congress do you

68
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,010
you've helped push legislation forward

69
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:58,439
what do you tell people when they ask

70
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:01,079
what's the disconnect here do you have

71
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:03,930
any hopes for congressional reform in

72
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,360
2020 or 20 21 with regard to medical

73
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,120
marijuana it's really it's really gonna

74
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,280
require the kind of grassroots driven

75
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,069
pressure on members of Congress to make

76
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,439
this happen I continue to be surprised

77
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:18,120
even as you're talking about the

78
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,609
approval ratings the popularity or the

79
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,950
favorability ratings across the country

80
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:25,590
most states have have legalized some

81
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:28,530
form or another of cannabis but still in

82
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:32,280
Congress there's a lot of unwillingness

83
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,979
to even look at the facts to examine the

84
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,500
data and therefore just rely on the

85
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:39,449
stigma and myths or the things that they

86
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,060
heard growing up saying hey marijuana's

87
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:44,189
bad or they say I don't want my kids to

88
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,920
smoke marijuana so I can't support any

89
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:48,840
kind of legalization others use the

90
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,599
excuse of kind of the cart before the

91
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,129
horse thing saying well you know I serve

92
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,560
on the Financial Services Committee for

93
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:58,459
example and I co-sponsored and supported

94
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,019
pushing through the safe banking act to

95
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:03,030
make sure that banks who are working

96
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,819
with local dispensaries or others within

97
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:09,870
this industry are not living under the

98
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:13,560
federal shadow of potential prosecution

99
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,480
and some of my my colleagues and on the

100
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,879
committee I was surprised they were just

101
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,319
saying well look you know even as they

102
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:21,600
advocate for states rights and

103
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,360
respecting states rights they say well

104
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,790
this is something that is still

105
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,920
federally illegal so we can't pass

106
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,140
this bill because it's federally illegal

107
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,240
even though the states have done there

108
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,370
there's not a whole lot of logic the

109
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,139
arguments that are being made so once

110
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,490
again I really believe in order for us

111
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,579
to bring about the kind of change we

112
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,680
need to pass legislation like the the

113
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:46,259
one I've introduced the only bipartisan

114
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,189
bill in Congress to end the federal

115
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:51,839
cannabis prohibition it's gonna require

116
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:55,199
constituents resident citizens of this

117
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:58,229
country you know Colin Colin endlessly

118
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,479
tweeting emailing dropping by mounting

119
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,129
this pressure that will force leaders in

120
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,310
Congress to catch up with the rest of

121
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:06,810
the countries at given that ninety-one

122
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,490
percent support and we still have

123
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,100
trouble moving forward is there anything

124
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,620
that's incremental and bipartisan and

125
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,840
realistic that we can do in this

126
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,250
Congress or next year's Congress given

127
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,859
everything else that's going on in the

128
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:23,370
country or is it just going to happen at

129
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,960
the state state level I think what we're

130
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,649
seeing is it's already happening at the

131
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:31,259
state level I think that the financial

132
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:34,259
industry is now paying more attention to

133
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,819
the opportunities that exist within the

134
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:38,250
cannabis industry and I think that's

135
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:41,129
another pressure point that can help

136
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,750
influence members of Congress to

137
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:45,089
recognize if nothing else there's a

138
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:48,360
strong economic argument to be made here

139
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:51,539
as far as an incremental approach you

140
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,850
know we have a number of bills in place

141
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:56,129
that try to chip away at this for

142
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:59,160
example you would think as much as our

143
00:05:56,129 --> 00:06:01,500
country supports veterans that that

144
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,230
would be kind of an easy win right a

145
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,970
low-hanging fruit to be able to say our

146
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:08,040
veterans are coming home dealing with

147
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:10,200
chronic pain many of them or traumatic

148
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,870
brain injury post-traumatic stress and

149
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,449
they don't want to just numb that pain

150
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,670
away by taking these highly addictive

151
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:20,699
opioids and they want to be able to have

152
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:23,430
access to medicinal cannabis so let's

153
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:26,610
let our VA Doc's prescribe that or even

154
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:31,170
refer them to someone locally even that

155
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:33,720
is not something that this Congress the

156
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:35,910
the this highly partisan environment in

157
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,340
Congress has been willing to get done

158
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:40,710
and to put on the President's desk I

159
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:42,419
think potentially the strongest

160
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:45,120
that could be made where there could be

161
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:49,470
an incremental approach is is around

162
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,470
medicine it is it is undeniable and

163
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,670
there are so many examples of how

164
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,650
medical cannabis has saved people's

165
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,960
lives we saw a little bit of progress

166
00:06:55,649 --> 00:07:00,509
made around the story of Charlotte and

167
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:03,329
how her parents and those like them

168
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:06,029
found the only relief for their children

169
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:08,639
in their epileptic seizures through the

170
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:11,519
use of cannabis and I think there's a

171
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,349
lot more that we can do on that to say

172
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,990
if nothing else let's begin with a

173
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:20,100
national decriminalization legalization

174
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:21,569
of medical cannabis when we talk about

175
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,030
states leading the charge

176
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:26,819
I see Hawaii is implementing medical

177
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:29,459
marijuana there's continued drive to

178
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:30,899
bring adult use cannabis to Hawaii what

179
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:33,599
do you foresee happening in your home

180
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:35,009
state I think Hawaii and Ford we've been

181
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,960
on the cutting edge of a lot of things

182
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:39,649
that I'm really proud of but in this

183
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,029
area it's it's disheartening I really

184
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:44,370
there's there's a bit of a generational

185
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:45,989
difference I think in some ways even

186
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,569
though we're a strong Democratic state

187
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:50,189
the representatives and Senators are

188
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:53,159
pretty diverse

189
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:55,550
I was really disheartened when even as

190
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,380
both our State House and state Senate

191
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:02,009
passed legislation I think it was last

192
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:04,560
year the year before that said if opioid

193
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:07,349
addiction qualifies under our medical

194
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,540
cannabis access laws it was it had

195
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:13,140
bipartisan support but our governor

196
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:15,360
vetoed it citing two issues number one

197
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:18,889
he says there's just not enough evidence

198
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:22,080
and data to show that medical cannabis

199
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:24,719
will help people who are struggling with

200
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:27,269
opioid addiction which is just crazy

201
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,180
it's crazy because we've seen how in

202
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:31,949
states where people have that option to

203
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,509
use medical cannabis the numbers of

204
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:36,779
opioid addiction and opioid related

205
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:38,700
deaths have decreased dramatically

206
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:40,589
the second reason he cited well you know

207
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,790
if they want to if they want to include

208
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,710
this then they can go through the

209
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:45,000
bureaucracy of the medical review board

210
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,950
and so on and so on

211
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,570
who we already know is opposed to this

212
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,910
and will have a predetermined outcome

213
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:54,660
just shows the work that still needs to

214
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:56,969
be done even in my home state and I I

215
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,860
counting my voice among many to be able

216
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:02,639
to push this forward because it has to

217
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,259
do directly with adult use with opening

218
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,839
up medical cannabis for all the

219
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:09,839
different needs that people have but it

220
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,850
also is impacting the hemp industry that

221
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,649
I think has so much potential especially

222
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:17,360
in my home state of Hawaii where you can

223
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:22,350
farm 365 days a year they had to

224
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:24,360
completely destroy a whole crop of hemp

225
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:27,319
I think it was grown at the University

226
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:31,289
of Hawaii to begin this pilot project

227
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:34,708
because it had some minut fraction of

228
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:36,509
too much THC in that hemp and they had

229
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:39,479
to completely destroy it it just it

230
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:42,659
doesn't make any sense to me citizens

231
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,550
often feel bewildered and powerless when

232
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:47,370
it comes to affecting this national

233
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:50,458
change but I'm sure you've seen how

234
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:52,698
citizens everyday can affect their

235
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:55,169
environment in their local cities and

236
00:09:52,698 --> 00:09:57,419
counties whether it was in the city of

237
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:59,399
Honolulu all the way through their

238
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:03,509
regions and their state legislators

239
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:05,789
office in 2020 what is the the checklist

240
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:07,199
as a citizen for engagement and and

241
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:08,610
pushing on these issues it sounds like

242
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:11,099
it starts with being registered to vote

243
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:13,610
registering others to vote what do you

244
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,000
tell people to make them feel empowered

245
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,100
absolutely

246
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,828
registering to vote and making sure that

247
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,329
your vote your voice is heard through

248
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:24,629
your vote at every level of government

249
00:10:21,328 --> 00:10:26,338
is essential try to do at least a little

250
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:27,809
bit of research before you go in and

251
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:31,500
cast your vote

252
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:34,500
ask your your elected leaders questions

253
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,870
and share information I think I think

254
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,308
the biggest hurdle here is overcoming

255
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:43,230
this gap in lack of understanding and

256
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:46,169
demystifying the myths and stigmas that

257
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:49,889
still surround cannabis and really talk

258
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:52,049
about the real life examples of how this

259
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:54,058
has has created a lot of opportunity or

260
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:57,838
personally impacted someone's health or

261
00:10:54,058 --> 00:11:00,448
really it comes down to the question of

262
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,279
liberty and freedom that every one of us

263
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:06,058
should have the freedom to be able to

264
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:08,429
choose what we put in our body and so

265
00:11:06,058 --> 00:11:10,139
making sure that your voice

266
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:13,379
is heard not only through the ballot box

267
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:15,539
but actively engaging with your elected

268
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:18,570
leaders and others in your community is

269
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:21,088
what I think will have the most the most

270
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:24,680
powerful impact and I think we've got to

271
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:27,000
do it at every level of government you

272
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:29,399
you do get those emails from your

273
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,528
readers you are your constituents do you

274
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,570
get those physical printed letters do

275
00:11:31,528 --> 00:11:34,980
you do you get those meetings have they

276
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,360
moved the needle for you do you have

277
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:40,500
personal stories that have changed your

278
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:44,009
votes I have not not related to cannabis

279
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:48,028
you know we have had other situations

280
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:50,039
where there was a bill that was coming

281
00:11:48,028 --> 00:11:55,289
to the House floor for example that had

282
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:57,419
to do with privacy online it was

283
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:59,009
something that as we were heading

284
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:03,559
quickly to the vote I think the day

285
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:05,939
before it had large bipartisan support

286
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:08,699
there were things though in that bill

287
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,980
that would have had unintended negative

288
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:15,209
consequences on our own civil liberties

289
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:17,820
and privacy and I saw in real time how

290
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,389
in my office phones are ringing off the

291
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,180
hook

292
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:23,240
emails were coming in like crazy twitter

293
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:26,819
was blowing up with people saying don't

294
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,250
support this bill because X Y &amp; Z it

295
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,528
will have a negative impact on our own

296
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:35,220
civil liberties as it pertains to our

297
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:38,129
online engagement and within a span of

298
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,778
hours on that day that the vote was

299
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:42,720
being had on the House floor

300
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:45,208
it went from a bill that had

301
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,889
overwhelming bipartisan support to

302
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:50,369
having overwhelming bipartisan

303
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:53,100
opposition and the bill died so this

304
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:56,070
doesn't happen every single day but I

305
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:59,159
think it illustrates the power of of the

306
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:01,079
people in this country that that that

307
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:02,699
really too often isn't recognized and

308
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:04,019
then people rightly so they feel

309
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,459
frustrated because they feel like their

310
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,278
voices aren't being heard in a lot of

311
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:09,989
cases but this is one of I think a few

312
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:12,870
examples that shows hey when we all

313
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:14,990
stand up and use every platform possible

314
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:18,419
to make sure that our voices are heard

315
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:21,450
they will be heard and depending on how

316
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:22,049
your elected leader responds is how we

317
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,850
as voters

318
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:26,128
can hold them accountable we still have

319
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,600
the power to hire and fire people if

320
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:31,259
they're not doing their job

321
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,028
lastly Leafly the app that I work at our

322
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:34,800
news organization is releasing a jobs

323
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:36,720
count this morning that finds that in

324
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,389
2020 about two hundred and forty

325
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,439
thousand Americans or a ployed in the

326
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:42,269
cannabis industry

327
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:44,219
you know comprising billions and

328
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:47,399
billions of dollars of economic activity

329
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:50,220
it seems like the level of institutional

330
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:52,649
advocacy for cannabis might be higher

331
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,720
than it's ever been in Washington DC but

332
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:56,999
there's a lot of industry leaders in the

333
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,709
audience who been battered by high taxes

334
00:13:56,999 --> 00:14:00,360
and regulations and ongoing prohibition

335
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:02,338
and some of them must be wondering if

336
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,110
the message is getting through to

337
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:06,689
Capitol Hill so my last question is are

338
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:09,269
you seeing that lobbying blitz are you

339
00:14:06,688 --> 00:14:11,730
seeing that advocacy show up like never

340
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:13,589
before on Capitol Hill are these K

341
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,928
Street dollars being well-spent in terms

342
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:19,610
of the cannabis industry trying to you

343
00:14:15,928 --> 00:14:23,249
know participate in get its voice heard

344
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:26,100
I think it's too early to tell to be

345
00:14:23,249 --> 00:14:27,899
honest I think that I'd have to go back

346
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,909
and look at the results but when we

347
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:32,669
passed the safe banking act as one

348
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:35,129
example on the House floor I didn't see

349
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:38,099
anywhere near the kind of bipartisan

350
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:40,678
support that I felt it should have I

351
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,589
think there's there's still a lot more

352
00:14:40,678 --> 00:14:45,178
that needs to be done I don't know how

353
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:49,709
much is being put into this from an

354
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:51,208
industry perspective but bluntly bluntly

355
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:54,558
there are still some high hurdles to

356
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:57,899
cross I think it's so important that we

357
00:14:54,558 --> 00:15:01,139
don't allow this issue to become caught

358
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:03,600
up in the hyper partisan environment in

359
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:06,089
Washington where yeah sure now in the

360
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,100
House Democrats have the majority where

361
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:11,040
we can pass legislation like the safe

362
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:14,490
Banking Act almost with with full

363
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:17,099
Democrat support with no or very few

364
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,448
Republicans on board but now it's going

365
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,028
to the Senate where it's sitting there

366
00:15:18,448 --> 00:15:23,789
like many other bills just waiting for a

367
00:15:21,028 --> 00:15:27,149
vote that may or may not come about I

368
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:30,688
think on a bright note an area where we

369
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:33,208
can look to how this has worked has been

370
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:35,240
around the successful inclusion of hemp

371
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:36,979
in the last farm bill

372
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,778
that was past something that saw a lot

373
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,620
of opposition even for Mitch McConnell

374
00:15:38,778 --> 00:15:44,539
for a long time but we know how powerful

375
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:47,629
the hemp industry that's growing in his

376
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:49,879
home state had a direct impact on him in

377
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:51,740
being the one to make sure that the

378
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:54,620
provision that we work to include in the

379
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,709
house stayed in that Senate version that

380
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,970
was finally signed into law

381
00:15:56,708 --> 00:16:01,519
representative Gabbard thank you so much

382
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,350

383
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,720
and enduring that criticism of doing so

384
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:07,310

385
