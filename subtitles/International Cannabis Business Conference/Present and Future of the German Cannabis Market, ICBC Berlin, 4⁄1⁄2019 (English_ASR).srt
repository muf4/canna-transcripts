1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,349
hello and good afternoon it's lovely to

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,620
see you and it's a great privilege to

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:09,869
host a conversation at ICC I have a lot

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,820
of respect for Alex Rogers and I think

5
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:13,919
this is one of the best cannabis

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,649
conferences that happens which is why we

7
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:21,778
have made an effort to come from Canada

8
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:24,778
to come and be here today so whenever

9
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:26,250
I'm asked to host a panel I find that

10
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:27,989
it's an opportunity for me to learn

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,660
about something that I don't know about

12
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:33,149
and I seek out experts who have the

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,149
knowledge that I don't have to study the

14
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:38,520
subject and then to come and share with

15
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,859
you so I didn't really understand the

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,660
complicated nuances of the German

17
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:44,820
landscape for positive for physicians

18
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:48,359
and patients and I wanted to understand

19
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,789
it also with global lens on what the

20
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,670
experience is for both physicians and

21
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,469
patients and these are the experts that

22
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,149
have been teaching me and now we're

23
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,939
going to share with you what our

24
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,910
conversations have been so I would love

25
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:11,158
to first introduce to you mr. Burkhardt

26
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:15,149
Leonard on the far end here yeah I am

27
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,740
learning that he is a bit of a hero in

28
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,100
these realms in terms of regulatory

29
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:23,579
reform so mr. Bernard was a member of

30
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:25,438
the German parliament until 2017 he's a

31
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:28,739
member of the Social Democratic Party

32
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:30,719
and he was responsible for the budget of

33
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:33,750
the Federal Ministry of Health and the

34
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,819
drug policy spokesperson for the Social

35
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,159
Democratic Party but he played a

36
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:40,769
decisive role in shaping Germany's drug

37
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,990
policy for the past four years during

38
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:44,728
his time in the in the Parliament mr.

39
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:46,679
bleonard was instrumental in the

40
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:49,049
development of Germany's law on medical

41
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,990
cannabis one of the main objectives he

42
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,290
had was to give patients access to

43
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:54,868
cost-free

44
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,820
medical cannabis and he is directly

45
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:59,218
responsible for making germany's medical

46
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:01,228
cannabis legislation more patient

47
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:03,658
friendly and less bureaucratic in

48
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:06,978
several key ways right before it was

49
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,978
passed which we will discuss

111
00:04:56,978 --> 00:05:01,329
changing rapidly in terms of reform

112
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,490
around medical cannabis around the world

113
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:05,050
and in Germany and I always believe that

114
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,300
it's really important to take a look

115
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,490
back and to have an understanding of

116
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,639
where we came from as we're looking

117
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:15,218
forward into our future so we are going

118
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,460
to start with a little bit of a history

119
00:05:15,218 --> 00:05:22,509
lesson about how we got to where we are

120
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:25,149
in Germany so mister bleonard would you

121

cannabis became legal in Germany tell us

123
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:38,258

00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:11,829
you so much and also in the final hours

225
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:14,600
before the proposed law became

226
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:16,250
legislation you fought very hard in the

227
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,389
last hours for a couple of very

228
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:22,899
important changes for patients and thank

229
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:22,899
you for that

230
00:10:25,778 --> 00:10:30,769
Sebastian you have been navigating the

231
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:33,379
medical framework in Germany since it

232
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:35,600
became law two years ago with a

233
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:37,970
particular awareness of the patient

234
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,310
experience and I'm wondering if you can

235
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:43,490
speak to us about some of the unique

236
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:46,909
acts aspects of the German medical

237
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:49,850
cannabis landscape yeah it's very

238
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:52,039
important for me to start with the

239
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:55,639
perspective of the patients because I

240
00:10:52,039 --> 00:11:00,529
agree very much with work our bleonard

241
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:02,509
that this law is a huge leap for this

242
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:04,189
for this country and for a lot of

243
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:08,210
patients we've we are now seeing we're

244
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:11,120
all sitting here so it enabled a lot of

245
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:12,980
patients to get access and it's when I

246
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,549
hear about the details of what you told

247
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:18,409
me it's it's an amazing process and I

248
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:20,359
really can value much more when I hear

249
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:23,089
about the details of how it came to that

250
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,800
law how much you move there for the

251
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:28,149
patients though in the last two years

252
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:31,219
it's been a very painful experience and

253
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:35,059
to get access to cannabis this was

254
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:37,550
because I give you only a few aspects of

255
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:39,619
that process the thousand patients who

256
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:43,509
had managed to get special licenses

257
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:46,039
before the law was came to place it was

258
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:49,309
we had like around a thousand patients

259
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:51,529
who got special permits these were not

260
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:53,089
just renewed so they had to go run

261
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:54,649
through the system again and some of

262
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:56,240
them didn't get their medication and

263
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:59,360
didn't get approved by doctors so that

264
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,060
was that was really painful for them the

265
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,909
other patients who were then able to

266
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:06,889
access a cannabis were bounced back from

267
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:08,839
their doctors many of them were rejected

268
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:12,199
because the doctors of course they

269
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:14,330
didn't know the new law they do know how

270
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,860
to prescribe some of them just wanted to

271
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:18,410
know how do I do this

272
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,060
you know what's the DOE saying what's

273
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:22,039
out there so in the beginning it was

274
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:26,209
really hard for them to get to their

275
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:27,740
medication the prices went up for

276
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,590
cannabis we're going to talk about the

277
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:33,730
reasons later a lot of the patient's

278
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:36,500
only received private prescriptions so

279
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,330
you could say a price is why would that

280
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,429
matter to the German patients they get

281
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:42,590
reimbursed no they didn't in the

282
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:44,539
beginning only thirty percent of the

283
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:46,759
applications went through the insurances

284
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:48,860
were slow to understand the new law

285
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:53,149
probably and they rejected a lot of the

286
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:54,740
applications so for for many patients

287
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:57,620
that was very frustrating and then of

288
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:01,850
course we heard it before supply was a

289
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:04,039
big deal we all the LPS coming in here

290
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:07,070
everybody who'd distributed cannabis had

291
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:12,110
we all had supply issues the market

292
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:13,500
exploded and so is some really we were

293
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:15,600
able to give

294
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,210
medication to a lot of people to give

295
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,129
medical cannabis to a lot more patients

296
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:22,740
but it was not easy to give give it to

297
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:24,720
them consistently and having having it

298
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,460
all avaible everybody available so I

299
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,050
think it's really important to have that

300
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,000
patient perspective and to understand

301
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:32,009
the German market because it also it

302
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,450
shows you how much frustration was there

303
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:38,549
how much criticism was there and there

304
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:42,210
there definitely need to be some

305
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:43,879
improvements can you tell me about two

306
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:47,879
things I would love to hear more about

307
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:50,370
regress and also your ability to

308
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:55,230
communicate with and educate and support

309
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:57,539
patients in Germany yeah I would like to

310
00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:00,720
talk generally a little bit more about

311
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:03,809
the regulations so in Germany and then I

312
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,810
will pick up the requesting yeah so in

313
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:08,639
Germany every doctor except for dentists

314
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:12,929
and veterinarians is allowed to

315
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:16,259
prescribe cannabis it's effectively a no

316
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:17,879
label substance so it is classified as

317
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:21,480
an ingredient to a medication which

318
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:24,000
gives it that status a problem with that

319
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,480
is that pharmacists then have to make an

320
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,799
identity test and put a hundred percent

321
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,080
price margin on the product which makes

322
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:32,939
cannabis exceedingly expensive in the

323
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,460
international comparison here so it's

324
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:38,250
like 22 euros a gram or something around

325
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:43,259
that approximately depending on how it's

326
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:45,600
handled the other thing with so it's

327
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:50,250
it's a no label drug it can be

328
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:52,290
reimbursed and basically the law states

329
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,240
that it has to be reimbursed except for

330
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:57,449
exceptional cases where the medical

331
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,970
services of the insurance say no that's

332
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:02,580
not a case where we reimburse so that is

333
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:04,529
a very special situation the regressed

334
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,200
situation that you were talking about is

335
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:09,689
one where doctors we heard that a lot

336
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,580
from doctors they were afraid to

337
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:14,850
prescribe I mean many doctors didn't

338
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:16,620
want to prescribe for reimbursement

339
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:18,450
because they were like ooh we have to go

340
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:23,100
through they also have to go through a

341
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:24,720
non interventional forum where they have

342
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,830
to make observations about patients so

343
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,690
they have paperwork to do

344
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,240
and it's a difficult process to go

345
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,649
through the application and they were

346
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,180
afraid then also we heard that a lot

347
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:35,980
from doctors that they would get a

348
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:38,139
regress problem that would mean that the

349
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:42,100
doctors actually for their patients they

350
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:45,458
get the applications to for them to get

351
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:48,250
reimbursed but later the insurances

352
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:50,229
would have the ability to come back to

353
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:52,208
them after a year or so and to evaluate

354
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,709
the prescription patterns and say hey

355
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:55,629
you're prescribing a very expensive

356
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:58,000
medicine so maybe we're taking away the

357
00:15:55,629 --> 00:16:00,070
money from you that you've that you've

358
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,600
taken out of the health system so a lot

359
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,278
of doctors we haven't seen that

360
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,899
happening yet but in the beginning that

361
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,490
was a big factor for doctors where they

362
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:08,259
were like whoops we are not gonna do

363
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:10,959
that so that blew me away when I learned

364
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:13,240
that that if if the insurance agencies

365
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:16,000
assess that a doctor is over prescribing

366
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,980
cannabis and is taxing the insurance

367
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,110
system too much they can go back and

368
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,940
personally take that money out of a

369
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,740

370

that these are extremely valuable points

420
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:35,539
and I now seeing the German mark how it

421

unfolded I can see how much of an effect

422

of a positive effect those last changes

you made you just mentioned had I just

424
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,750
don't want to mention two things so what

425
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:49,490
I said the no label situation is of

426
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,869

rothman shuang's talk it's great because

429
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:57,920
a doctor here is not bound to

430
00:18:55,099 --> 00:19:02,269
indications so and we know that there's

431
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:05,200
such a huge wide spectrum of illnesses

432
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:07,609
and indications where cannabis can help

433
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,490
but if you want to understand the

434
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:12,439
dynamics of the German market then you

435
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,779
have to see this there is this wide

436
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,519
range where you can prescribe the

437
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:18,349
insurances have to cover and now the

438
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:20,539
insurances came back in the last year's

439
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:22,129
to say oh wait the evidence situation

440
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:24,680
for some of those indications is not

441
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:26,720
really really there so that this is you

442
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,820
you understand the dynamics of the

443
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,420
German market really well if you see

444
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:34,250
that no label situation and

445
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,690
reimbursement and and we will circle

446
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,240
back around to talking more about

447
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:42,920
evidence thank you both of you

448
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,750
doctor where you have been teaching

449
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,539
about the use of medical cannabis in

450
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,859
clinical practice for decades and I know

451
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:51,039
that you have been working in many

452
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:53,388
regions around the world recently as

453
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,368
countries are evolving there

454
00:19:53,388 --> 00:19:57,408
framework around medical cannabis and

455
00:19:55,368 --> 00:20:00,348
I'm wondering if you can speak a little

456
00:19:57,409 --> 00:20:02,149
bit about the physician experience sort

457
00:20:00,348 --> 00:20:04,519
of the worldwide physician experience

458
00:20:02,148 --> 00:20:08,268
and how it may differ from what's

459
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:10,729
happening in Germany Thank You Hillary

460
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:12,319
I think probably instead of contrasting

461
00:20:10,729 --> 00:20:14,959
it with what's happening in Germany it's

462
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:18,078
important to say that around the world

463
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:20,058
the one of the single biggest challenges

464
00:20:18,078 --> 00:20:22,548
to the adoption of medical cannabis as a

465
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:23,838
therapy is the fact that physicians are

466
00:20:22,548 --> 00:20:26,509
the ones who have to write the

467
00:20:23,838 --> 00:20:28,219
prescription or the authorization they

468
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:30,229
are the gatekeepers to this therapy

469
00:20:28,219 --> 00:20:32,538
rightly or wrongly in some jurisdictions

470
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,469
nurse practitioners have this ability in

471
00:20:32,538 --> 00:20:35,269
others there are other health

472
00:20:33,469 --> 00:20:37,729
professionals who can do this but by and

473
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:40,159
large around the world it is a health is

474
00:20:37,729 --> 00:20:42,229
health care professional or physician

475
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,209
who has the responsibility to decide

476
00:20:42,229 --> 00:20:46,369
whether this is an appropriate therapy

477
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:47,959
for their patient based on the guidance

478
00:20:46,368 --> 00:20:49,908
that they receive from their government

479
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:52,940
based on their regulations but the vast

480
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:56,028
majority of physicians have no idea

481
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,798
what cannabis is how it works what the

482
00:20:56,028 --> 00:21:00,169
endocannabinoid system is they are

483
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:02,929
remarkably uneducated and that's a

484
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:05,229
phenomenal barrier the challenge to

485
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:07,820
educating physicians to putting

486
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:10,459
endocannabinoid physiology in medical

487
00:21:07,819 --> 00:21:12,408
schools in teaching practitioners about

488
00:21:10,459 --> 00:21:14,749
using cannabis is there's no government

489
00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:16,249
incentive for government to do this the

490
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:18,588
medical schools aren't stepping up and

491
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:20,899
putting this into their curricula it's

492
00:21:18,588 --> 00:21:22,759
falling on the industry to provide this

493
00:21:20,898 --> 00:21:25,038
education and that creates another

494
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:26,778
problem because the industry is the

495
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:29,628
cannabis industry is coming on the back

496
00:21:26,778 --> 00:21:31,940
of a long history of pharmaceutical

497
00:21:29,628 --> 00:21:33,888
companies having behaved rather badly

498
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:36,139
when it comes to teaching physicians

499
00:21:33,888 --> 00:21:38,148
about their medicines taking them for

500
00:21:36,138 --> 00:21:40,038
expensive holidays and paying their

501
00:21:38,148 --> 00:21:42,048
wives to come on their trips with them

502
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:43,669
and taking them for fancy dinners and

503
00:21:42,048 --> 00:21:46,069
spending money on these physicians

504
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:47,749
knowing full well that that kind of

505
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:50,178
behavior would influence their

506
00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:51,618
prescribing practices this is now being

507
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:53,509
regulated against and we're hearing

508
00:21:51,618 --> 00:21:56,808
stories of big pharma companies being

509
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:59,118
punished and being being fined and in

510
00:21:56,808 --> 00:22:00,979
some cases even being taken to court for

511
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:03,288
some of the practices they've done with

512
00:22:00,979 --> 00:22:04,940
respect to physician education so how is

513
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:06,950
the industry supposed to respond to

514
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,450
educating the people who are supposed to

515
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,809
beep riding as medicine that's a

516
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:13,250
phenomenal problem its global and I

517
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:15,529
think it requires a really interesting

518
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,700
the role of the nonprofit networks the

519
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:19,039
role of the patient advocacy

520
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,930
organizations somehow building an arm's

521
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,359
length between the industry and the

522
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:24,200
doctor so that the education gets where

523
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:26,779
it needs to go

524
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,640
but isn't seen as an incentive or a

525
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:30,410
payment to the physician to prescribe

526
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,370
there's some really dodgy practices

527
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:33,110
happening out there

528
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:35,000
and I think we have to be very careful

529
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:37,250
that in the name of educating physicians

530
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,890
we aren't committing the same crimes

531
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:48,950
that our predecessors than the pharma

532
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:52,460
industry have have committed thank you

533
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:55,340
so Sebastian is talking about the hunger

534
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:57,049
for more clinical research I mean that's

535
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:58,579
true in Germany and I think it's true

536
00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:02,299
you know in many places around the world

537
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:05,149
in Canada we have approximately 1% of

538
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:07,220
our population is registered legal

539
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:10,070
medical cannabis users and if that was

540
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,569
the ratio was the same in Germany that

541
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:13,639
would mean that we would have almost

542
00:23:11,569 --> 00:23:16,220
800,000 people in Germany and we're

543
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,530
currently at 40,000 people in Germany

544
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:20,779
approximately that are using the legal

545
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:24,019
system so I'm wondering if you can talk

546
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:25,549
a little bit about the acceleration of

547
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:28,519
research that's happening around the

548
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:30,980
world and what you see that's coming on

549
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:33,589
the horizon that is going to fill some

550
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,210
of these needs sure so it's coupled with

551
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:36,769
the physician education because when you

552
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:38,809
speak to and I speak to roomfuls like

553
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:40,759
this but they're all physicians I mean I

554
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:42,200
think there are two doctors in here we

555
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:43,759
need a lot more meetings where the room

556
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,430
is filled with physicians and not as

557
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:48,259
much business guys I no disrespect

558
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:50,120
intended but those are the people we

559
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:51,410
have to be speaking to but they will

560
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:53,119
always stand up and say well there isn't

561
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:54,440
enough evidence where's the data where

562
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,599
are the clinical trials where is the

563
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,370
proof that it works I heard a panelist

564
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:00,230
earlier just saying you know it works we

565
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:01,849
know it works you know it works okay but

566
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,470
the doctors don't think it works they

567
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:05,719
aren't being given the data in the same

568
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:07,910
way so we need to design ways to get

569
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,650
evidence to them which will then help

570
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:11,240
them make these decisions so the

571
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:13,130
education is one part but supplying the

572
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,930
evidence is the other there are sort of

573
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,640
two main ways of doing this one is

574
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:18,980
through the standard randomized control

575
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,930
trial and that's a double-blind

576
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,819
an experiment where people are put on

577
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:24,590
either the drug or placebo and it really

578
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:27,019
is considered as the gold standard of

579
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:28,819
therapy but these studies require very

580
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:31,519
very tightly controlled products for one

581
00:24:28,819 --> 00:24:33,529
thing and they require a lot of time and

582
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,839
a lot of expertise and to invest in the

583
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:37,789
kind of data to get drugs into the

584
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,230
clinical trial and into the pipeline

585
00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:41,690
where they're approved as medicines

586
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:43,640
costs tens if not hundreds of millions

587
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:45,410
of dollars to get there so there has to

588
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,900
be an investment in that and I think I

589
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:50,720
predict that in 1020 years we will see

590
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:52,370
far more cannabinoid medicines approved

591
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,079
as therapies and that's going to change

592
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:55,459
the story completely but it's going to

593
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:57,460
take a long time to get there

594
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:00,079
the other thing we can do is actually

595
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,539
provide patients with access to cannabis

596
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:04,909
products and track their real world

597
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:07,190
experience and this idea of real world

598
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:09,980
evidence is actually being now reviewed

599
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:12,799
by regulators as a significant way of

600
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:15,140
evaluating the effectiveness of drugs

601
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:17,480
and and while other medicine not just

602
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:19,100
cannabis but other drugs as well and

603
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,319
there's - and make concepts here one is

604
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:23,240
efficacy the clinical trial will tell

605
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:25,069
you if the drug is efficacious or not

606
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,559
but doesn't tell you if it's effective

607
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:29,689
effective is a real-world situation is

608
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:31,819
it working for patients at large and

609
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:33,950
vast majority people using cannabis are

610
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:35,569
not clinical trial subjects they are

611
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,400
people with other problems other

612
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:38,750
diseases taking other medications who

613
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,850
party wouldn't fit into the standard

614
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:43,039
clinical trial so following these

615
00:25:40,849 --> 00:25:45,529
patients as real-world evidence studies

616
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,420
open-label studies this is the second

617
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:49,879
arm of research that I think we can do

618
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,830
and this satisfies two major problems

619
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,710
one is getting patients access to the

620
00:25:51,829 --> 00:25:57,409
products and getting data to help inform

621
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:59,779
physicians in future educational

622
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:01,610
programs so I think that's the approach

623
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:03,950
we need to take in terms of developing

624
00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:06,709
evidence thank you

625
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:08,420
canopy has undertaken supporting quite a

626
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:10,220
lot of research and there's two

627
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:13,340
particular projects that I'm wondering

628
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:14,779
if you would share with us about one is

629
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:17,059
I'm wondering if you can talk about the

630
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:19,460
professorship at the University of

631
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:20,929
British Columbia and the clinical

632
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,670
science that's happening there and

633
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:24,740
second I'm wondering if you can talk a

634
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:27,620
little bit about the research in the

635
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:29,480
long-term care facilities Thank You

636
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:31,759
Hilary so sure I'll touch quickly on

637
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,500
these two major issues

638
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:34,730
Canada and they're not the only ones but

639
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,619
they're they're very sort of front and

640
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:39,589
center in the discussion one is the use

641
00:26:36,619 --> 00:26:41,750
of cannabis to help reduce the the

642
00:26:39,589 --> 00:26:43,429
opioid abuse epidemic the opioid

643
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:45,589
overdose crisis whatever you choose to

644
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:47,269
call it it's a massive problem in North

645
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:50,089
America thousands of people are dying

646
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:52,609
every month and it's really a crisis of

647
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:54,349
epic proportions there's a potential

648
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:57,709
that cannot cannabis and cannabinoid

649
00:26:54,349 --> 00:26:59,299
medicines may assist in in changing the

650
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:01,610
direction of this epidemic

651
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:02,480
professor MJ Molloy and his colleagues

652
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:05,629
at the University of British Columbia

653
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,099
received a grant from canopy from the

654
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:09,380
University of British Columbian from the

655
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:11,899
government of BC very much led by

656
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:16,430
Hilary's leadership I should add that

657
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:18,320
this this gift to dr. Miller's team is

658
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:20,330
enabling him to spend two and a half

659
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:22,159
million dollars on evaluating whether

660
00:27:20,329 --> 00:27:24,740
cannabis can be helpful in helping

661
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:27,050
people wean off intravenous street drugs

662
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:29,180
crack cocaine methamphetamines opioids

663
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:30,529
you name it there's a potential there

664
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,910
and this is happening at the street

665
00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:33,889
level where they're going into the

666
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:35,930
communities most affected and helping

667
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:38,540
administer this needs support this kind

668
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:40,190
of humanitarian crisis needs this kind

669
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:42,559
of intervention so we're very proud to

670
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:45,410
support that the other big issue is the

671
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:47,599
nursing homes where people with agitated

672
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:49,910
dementia as people in elderly care

673
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:52,339
long-term care facilities are being

674
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:54,560
asked or their loved ones are

675
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:56,799
approaching the this the units the

676
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:59,089
centers if they can put their

677
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:01,279
grandparents their parents their loved

678
00:27:59,089 --> 00:28:03,409
ones on cannabis because they think it

679
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,299
helps them reduce the dementia and the

680
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:07,009
agitation help them sleep and these are

681
00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:09,619
also people who are taking pretty strong

682
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:11,240
antipsychotics at benzos opioids to

683
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:13,129
control them and help them sleep at

684
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,930
night there's good anecdotal evidence

685
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:17,480
that this is helping but we're proposing

686
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:19,850
to follow these people by administering

687
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,680
properly cannabinoid therapies and then

688
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:23,629
tracking over time in a real-world

689
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,490
manner what is the experience what are

690
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:27,500
the medication use patterns profiles

691
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:28,970
changing and this study is ongoing at

692
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,130
the moment so two very different

693
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:33,529
populations but by taking compassionate

694
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:35,330
approaches we can provide medicines to

695
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:37,759
people but also track what happens in

696
00:28:35,329 --> 00:28:40,149
the real world thank you can't be

697
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,150
actually

698
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:46,069
canapé actually developed a new

699
00:28:44,058 --> 00:28:47,720
administration form in order to be able

700
00:28:46,069 --> 00:28:49,428
to work with long-term care facilities

701
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,100
we created soft gels which is

702
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:54,409
essentially little capsules because the

703
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:56,269
folks administering medicines in

704
00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:58,970
long-term care facilities didn't want to

705
00:28:56,269 --> 00:29:01,009
deal with inhalation or oil the medicine

706
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,538
needed to be stored and administered in

707
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:04,640
the same way as all of their other

708
00:29:02,538 --> 00:29:06,470
medications where which drove some

709
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,850
innovation on our end which is very

710
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:14,210
exciting thank you so we hope that there

711
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:16,609
we can see that there is evidence on the

712
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:19,429
horizon that's coming to continue to

713
00:29:16,609 --> 00:29:20,778
give clinicians the you know what they

714
00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:23,028
need to lean on to feel more comfortable

715
00:29:20,778 --> 00:29:24,769
using cannabis in their practice but

716
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:27,380
there are some other factors that are

717
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:29,480
potentially going to be accelerants in

718
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:32,720
the landscape in Germany that are coming

719
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,490
up can you speak to that please yeah for

720
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,220
sure

721
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:39,339
first of all of course we're expecting

722
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:43,339
the supply situation to get a lot better

723
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:45,470
in the near future of course because we

724
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:48,349
have to deliver GMP products it's not

725
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:50,750
and I see that a lot from patients we

726
00:29:48,349 --> 00:29:52,819
have very limited abilities to talk to

727
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:54,788
patients because of the German

728
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:57,798
advertising laws we basically are

729
00:29:54,788 --> 00:30:01,220
restricted to talking to pharmacists and

730
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:03,980
to doctors healthcare practitioners but

731
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:06,860
it's what what they don't see is that

732
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:08,450
GMP facilities have to build up first

733
00:30:06,859 --> 00:30:10,490
that we have to construct them that is a

734
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:13,308
very complicated super high-tech process

735
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:16,909
we have a facility now in Odense and

736
00:30:13,308 --> 00:30:18,918
Denmark that's gonna deliver a lot to

737
00:30:16,909 --> 00:30:21,889
the market and others are building up so

738
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:24,230
so the supply situation not only in in

739
00:30:21,888 --> 00:30:28,148
terms of quantity but also in terms of

740
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:31,399
having various firmly having various

741
00:30:28,148 --> 00:30:33,709
varieties of cannabis internet flowers

742
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:35,928
but also extracts and other products and

743
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:40,669
that will completely change the market

744
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:43,130
of course a second thing is that we see

745
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:47,179
the insurances approval rates going up

746
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:50,240
and I think I would like to add

747
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:53,490
something to what Mark said real-world

748
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,880
evidence what in a situation were the

749
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:58,890
insurances have to cover no label

750
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,050
substance so to say and they are like

751
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,820
well we're covering now costs for

752
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:05,480
somebody who has fibromyalgia and we

753
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:07,879
don't see really the evidence out there

754
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,558
we will have to introduce also

755
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:14,400
socio-economic data I mean showing in

756
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:16,109
the country that cannabis can save costs

757
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,790
and we see that already from the

758
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:20,369
Canadian market and from the US market

759
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:22,230
that in many places for years and years

760
00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:24,000
the Co medication went down we have

761
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:27,299
Studies on that and so we can show for

762
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,210
those places that yes patients who are

763
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:32,308
using cannabis are using less other

764
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:34,230
substances and are less costly for the

765
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:37,079
system so that's gonna be very important

766
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:39,990
for the German system what we have done

767
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:41,609
also if we compare the Canadian and the

768
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:43,589
German market we have to always remember

769
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:45,419
and this is one of the most important

770
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:47,639
point points and I keep on telling

771
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:51,420
people like a mantra the Canadian market

772
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:55,470
started 15 years ago or longer in 2001

773
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:58,289
and so we can use all the experience and

774
00:31:55,470 --> 00:32:00,140
the world so the recognition of cannabis

775
00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:03,599
as a medicine is a completely different

776
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:06,720
stage now worldwide and we profit from

777
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:09,240
that we brought in dark Canadian doctors

778
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,420
here to teach German doctors about their

779
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:15,000
experience really on a very how to do

780
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:17,130
level and that helped us a lot and

781
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,170
there's gonna be other not only clinical

782
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:20,910
and other evidence coming in but a

783
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:23,820
socio-economic data will be generated

784
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:26,250
here so there are a lot of factors that

785
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:28,349
will even accelerate a market where we

786
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:31,410
already have seen an explosion of

787
00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:33,839
patient numbers just let me add one last

788
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:37,080
comment about the number of 40,000 that

789
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:42,359
was published by the handles blood last

790
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:45,539
year data health related data in Germany

791
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:47,969
are very sensitive so these are really

792
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:51,109
rough estimates we really can't extract

793
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:54,140
exact numbers from those data because

794
00:32:51,109 --> 00:32:56,879
mainly also because many a doctor's

795
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,530
private prescriptions and we can't

796
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,230
really track them so we don't know if

797
00:32:58,529 --> 00:33:05,069
like 50 60 80 % of the prescriptions

798
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:06,740
that are being done here are private and

799
00:33:05,069 --> 00:33:09,918
we cannot really track those

800
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:12,288
thank you so mark some of the growing

801
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,970
pains that Germany is going through

802
00:33:12,288 --> 00:33:15,710
around the medical cannabis landscape

803
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:19,069
seem to echo some of the things that we

804
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:22,340
experienced in Canada and now in you

805
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:24,408
know Canada with almost 400,000 licensed

806
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:26,629
legal patients we've seen an incredible

807
00:33:24,409 --> 00:33:28,730
increase in the past couple of years and

808
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:32,450
I'm wondering if you can speak to the

809
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:35,450
factors that you think really stabilized

810
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:37,399
and encouraged more physicians to start

811
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:39,200
using cannabis in their practice why did

812
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:42,408
we see such a big uptake in the last few

813
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,298
years I think a couple of things

814
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:46,340
probably happened there was there's if

815
00:33:44,298 --> 00:33:49,970
you look at the trajectory of Canadian

816
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:51,980
cannabis patients over 20 years it began

817
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:54,110
very very slowly and the trajectory

818
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:57,079
really only began to pick up in the last

819
00:33:54,109 --> 00:33:59,058
five to ten years and it happened at the

820
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:00,829
same time as there were changes in the

821
00:33:59,058 --> 00:34:02,928
regulatory framework which allowed for

822
00:34:00,829 --> 00:34:05,148
there was a time in Canada when you only

823
00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:06,409
had one producer there was only one type

824
00:34:05,148 --> 00:34:08,569
of cannabis for a while it was

825
00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:11,539
restricted to 5% John Connor a party

826
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:13,309
remembers these days very well one kind

827
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:15,800
of cannabis grown in underground mines

828
00:34:13,309 --> 00:34:18,440
in Flin Flon Manitoba I mean this was a

829
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,119
limiting factor to just adoption

830
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,280
patients didn't like it they needed more

831
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:23,720
access so over the last five to ten

832
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,269
years we saw increasing numbers of

833
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:28,428
suppliers we saw ranges of products and

834
00:34:26,269 --> 00:34:30,440
I think that ability for patients to

835
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:33,168
have access to a wider range made them

836
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:37,220
more engaged in the process the second

837
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:39,259
thing was that the government began to

838
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:42,108
allow the companies that were licensed

839
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:44,869
to produce cannabis to make oils extract

840
00:34:42,108 --> 00:34:46,668
soft gels and alternative forms of of

841
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:48,829
cannabis products that weren't just

842
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:50,690
cannabis flour which of course was

843
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:53,348
associated with smoking even though

844
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:56,389
there are medical devices approved as

845
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:58,280
devices for delivering vapor to patients

846
00:34:56,389 --> 00:35:00,108
in Canada but this have built this

847
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,430
availability of other form factors I

848
00:35:00,108 --> 00:35:04,608
think was another thing for many

849
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:06,618
physicians a soft gel or an oil that

850
00:35:04,608 --> 00:35:10,369
contains so many milligrams of product

851
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:13,309
per milliliter is a much more easy thing

852
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:17,930
to think about as a medicine than a gram

853
00:35:13,309 --> 00:35:19,880
of dried flower at 18% THC and 1% CBD

854
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:20,719
for most physicians this doesn't really

855
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,119
mean much

856
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,139
they don't get what many doctors

857
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,740
probably don't know what a gram of

858
00:35:24,139 --> 00:35:29,659
cannabis looks like but this idea that

859
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:31,459
they could have gel caps and oils and

860
00:35:29,659 --> 00:35:33,589
bottles and syringes where they could

861
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:35,389
administered more titrated doses I think

862
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:37,670
this was a big factor then certainly

863
00:35:35,389 --> 00:35:39,409
surprised many of us that the patient's

864
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:41,630
also responded to this and it was around

865
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:45,589
the end of last year for the first time

866
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:48,260
that we saw the sale of oils and soft

867
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:51,289
gels actually exceeding the sale of

868
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:52,640
dried flower in Canada and the sale of

869
00:35:51,289 --> 00:35:54,980
dried flower tea started with dropping

870
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:57,980
off so patients were responding to this

871
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:59,329
it appears to be working for them but of

872
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,039
course it's a relatively new thing

873
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:02,779
stabilizing it and making them

874
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:04,509
reproducible is another challenge as

875
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:07,369
anyone who does this work will realize

876
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:09,920
making it into a pharmaceutical capsule

877
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:11,900
is still a little bit of a ways away but

878
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,849
under the Canadian regulations it was

879
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:18,710
allowed it's possible and I think that

880
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:20,930
was a big change thank you ok one toward

881
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:23,539
another accelerating factor that I see

882
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:28,629
in Germany is now the dot the first

883
00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:35,029
adopters here using using full-spectrum

884
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:36,680
cannabis flowers and extracts or first

885
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,940
they looked at the meta data and they

886
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:39,559
look at the situation now they are

887
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:41,210
seeing patients coming back to them and

888
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:42,440
saying oh this helped me with this and

889
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:44,358
this and this and this and this and that

890
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,730
so they are actually seeing the cases

891
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:49,848
and we had we talked to many of them and

892
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:51,320
so for doctors and they have a lot of

893
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:53,240
weight on their shoulders in Germany

894
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,609
because and that I forgot to mention

895
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:57,439
that before they really prescribed the

896
00:36:55,608 --> 00:36:58,759
product in Germany it's not like they

897
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,858
give you a prescription for medical

898
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,510
cannabis they actually put down the

899
00:37:00,858 --> 00:37:05,239
product that you're gonna get in the

900
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:06,589
pharmacy and so for them it's a lot of

901
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:08,809
weight on their shoulders and now they

902
00:37:06,588 --> 00:37:10,789
hear it from German doctors they hear it

903
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:13,309
from German doctors that this works they

904
00:37:10,789 --> 00:37:15,320
are seeing the cases and this is gonna

905
00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:16,699
accelerate I think in this year this is

906
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:19,070
gonna accelerate because it's it's

907
00:37:16,699 --> 00:37:21,469
becoming tangible now it's not just like

908
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:24,099
Canadian experience and the meta-data

909
00:37:21,469 --> 00:37:26,480
situation it's really there it's coming

910
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:28,550
yeah I just want to support that because

911
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,519
I think word-of-mouth is tremendously

912
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:33,050
popular or turn tremendously powerful in

913
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:34,639
this approach doctors talking to each

914
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:36,200
other they're not getting this interim

915
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:38,539
from their medical schools from their

916
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:39,919
associations from their their various

917
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:41,929
syndicates there they're hearing it from

918
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,700
each other and when they try it and they

919
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:45,319
see a few patients that benefit and if

920
00:37:43,699 --> 00:37:46,939
they know how to do it properly they

921
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,320
then see these differences they talk to

922
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,539
each other and I think a lot of the

923
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,460
growth arabs something like 17,000

924
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:54,739
physicians in canada now who have

925
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:57,889
written at least one authorization and

926
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:59,329
that's about 12 15 % of the canadian

927
00:37:57,889 --> 00:38:02,449
physicians not because they're being

928
00:37:59,329 --> 00:38:03,769
taught about it by the industry or by

929
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:05,419
their medical schools but because

930
00:38:03,769 --> 00:38:07,099
they're learning and telling each other

931
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:09,079
about this and their patients are coming

932
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:11,119
and telling them so that's a kind of a

933
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:12,679
groundswell of education that's

934
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,239
happening just from pure experience and

935
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:16,279
many patients are learning the same way

936
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:22,309
right patient service supporting each

937

much mister bleonard

1050
00:43:03,849 --> 00:43:08,860
I think it's an incredible thing that as

1051
00:43:06,969 --> 00:43:10,539
a part of the German law that health

1052
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:11,769
care insurance has been covered it's one

1053
00:43:10,539 --> 00:43:14,529
of the things that we're still fighting

1054
00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:16,840
for in Canada for patients to be able to

1055
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:18,610
afford their cannabis and I think that

1056
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,410
that particular aspect of the

1057
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:22,510
legislation that you're responsible for

1058
00:43:20,409 --> 00:43:24,730
um you've shown tremendous global

1059
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:26,620
leadership and you have set the standard

1060
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:27,969
for hopefully the rest of Europe and the

1061
00:43:26,619 --> 00:43:32,250
rest of the country that I hope will

1062
00:43:27,969 --> 00:43:32,250
catch up with your vision so thank you

1063
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,429
is all of the time that we have I want

1064
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:42,579
to really acknowledge and thank my

1065
00:43:39,429 --> 00:43:45,279
fellow panelists who are incredibly busy

1066
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:46,599
creating medical cannabis access around

1067
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,550
the world who have been working on it

1068
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:52,239
for a very long time thank you very much

1069
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:54,250
for joining me today and thank you we

1070
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:56,289
maybe have time for one do you have time

1071
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:58,090
for one question he looks very excited

1072
00:43:56,289 --> 00:44:00,389
maybe two questions you guys both look

1073
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:05,470
excited two questions hold on

1074
00:44:00,389 --> 00:44:06,940
thanks very much and so at the MIT PR X

1075
00:44:05,469 --> 00:44:08,559
I that workshops were bringing in

1076
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,650
doctors are bringing in pharmacists

1077
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:12,699
manufacturers

1078
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:16,039
Uber's etc etc and I'm often thinking

1079
00:44:12,699 --> 00:44:17,480
you're talking about how to advocate but

1080
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:19,369
there's a company like yours do you

1081
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,260
actually have a blueprint that we can

1082
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:23,890
actually follow here in Germany how to

1083
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:26,180
take the steps to actually go about

1084
00:44:23,889 --> 00:44:28,548
organizing the doctors and educating

1085
00:44:26,179 --> 00:44:31,250
them is there a blueprint that already

1086
00:44:28,548 --> 00:44:34,309
exists that we can follow I'll go back

1087
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:35,929
pre canopy to my McGill days and we

1088
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:37,819
published a paper in a journal called

1089
00:44:35,929 --> 00:44:39,469
the clinic clinical pharmacology and

1090
00:44:37,818 --> 00:44:41,630
therapeutics we actually published what

1091
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:43,639
we call the cannabis curriculum which

1092
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:45,380
was a kind of a step-by-step guide of

1093
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:47,568
what doctors should know about the plant

1094
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:49,670
and biology and the endocannabinoid

1095
00:44:47,568 --> 00:44:52,250
safety efficacy Beauvoir so there's

1096
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:54,200
there do exist these templates the way

1097
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:56,059
in which you deliver that to physicians

1098
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:57,949
depends on the jurisdiction a lot of

1099
00:44:56,059 --> 00:44:59,750
doctors like to learn in small groups so

1100
00:44:57,949 --> 00:45:01,669
they can talk to each other and exchange

1101
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:03,730
information and ideas some like to learn

1102
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:06,920
online so the idea of having online

1103
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:09,139
webinars or modules that they can go and

1104
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,990
check in it's really important that

1105
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:13,940
these programs be accredited by their by

1106
00:45:11,989 --> 00:45:16,189
their governing agency so they get

1107
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:18,829
credit for doing the courses this is

1108
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:20,240
often a huge currency for them and this

1109
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:22,640
actually speaks to the government's

1110
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:25,068
willingness to inform them because if

1111
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:26,358
they can get you know twelve CME credits

1112
00:45:25,068 --> 00:45:28,699
for having done in to medical education

1113
00:45:26,358 --> 00:45:30,980
they can tick a box that says yes I did

1114
00:45:28,699 --> 00:45:32,929
some training I got some CME credits

1115
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:34,608
which is good for my medical board that

1116
00:45:32,929 --> 00:45:37,098
shows that I'm getting my C Emmys and

1117
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:38,778
I'm learning something cool and new and

1118
00:45:37,099 --> 00:45:40,519
for a lot of doctors this is a totally

1119
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:42,798
new and exciting area so when they get

1120
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:45,440
into it they start going holy I had

1121
00:45:42,798 --> 00:45:47,298
no idea this stuff was doing what it

1122
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:50,210
does and then you get you've got another

1123
00:45:47,298 --> 00:45:54,048
excited person to lead the discussion so

1124
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:56,119
just creating the focus anyway that they

1125
00:45:54,048 --> 00:46:02,538
like it so that it's accredited and

1126
00:45:56,119 --> 00:46:05,450
comprehensive should do it oh the

1127
00:46:02,539 --> 00:46:07,150
troublemaker I was going to say this

1128
00:46:05,449 --> 00:46:09,949
isn't intended as a cross-examination

1129
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:13,970
question if it was I would say isn't it

1130
00:46:09,949 --> 00:46:16,460
true that mark I'm used to you defending

1131
00:46:13,969 --> 00:46:19,038
me and having my back not being not I

1132
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:21,949
just wanted to comment on dr. wares

1133
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:23,450
remarks about research and so on I've

1134
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:25,369
learned as a lawyer

1135
00:46:23,449 --> 00:46:27,319
that there were but some 10 royal

1136
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:31,159
Commission's of inquiry going back to

1137
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:34,550
1893 the Indian hemp spec Commission up

1138
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:38,750
to our least our Senate what in 2003

1139
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:41,590
there's 20,000 pubmed studies up there

1140
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:43,550
that you can access online and

1141
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:46,039
significantly I think in terms of the

1142
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:47,480
opiate crisis the national academy of

1143
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:50,059
science engineering and medicine

1144
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,860
surveyed all of the existing studies

1145
00:46:50,059 --> 00:46:53,389
commented on how difficult it has been

1146
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:57,019
to do the research but said

1147
00:46:53,389 --> 00:46:59,449
notwithstanding that there is conclusive

1148
00:46:57,019 --> 00:47:03,019
evidence that it is effective for

1149
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:07,039
chronic pain so what is the problem

1150
00:47:03,019 --> 00:47:09,500
doctors in terms of you know there is

1151
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:13,150
the evidence sure we can always do more

1152
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:16,039
studies but as you pointed out the

1153
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:18,380
doctor Malloy and the group at st. well

1154
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:21,409
at UBC and st. Paul's is doing a

1155
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:24,559
tremendous job and have reduced opiate

1156
00:47:21,409 --> 00:47:28,789
deaths so far so come on medical

1157
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:30,590
profession get on board the medical

1158
00:47:28,789 --> 00:47:33,050
profession you're expecting politicians

1159
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:35,809
to have common sense which is hard to

1160
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:37,210
find all over the world it's got nothing

1161
00:47:35,809 --> 00:47:39,650
to do sorry I didn't mean to interrupt

1162
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:40,940
but you know it's very frustrating for

1163
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,500
everyone throughout the world I think

1164
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:44,179
there was a question in there which I'll

1165
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:46,579
try and respond to and I always do is

1166
00:47:44,179 --> 00:47:48,019
reflect the fact that yes the National

1167
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:50,239
Academy of Sciences engineering medicine

1168
00:47:48,019 --> 00:47:52,750
conclusive evidence I'm fully aware of

1169
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:54,949
that but I can point to five other

1170
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:56,869
meta-analysis systematic reviews that

1171
00:47:54,949 --> 00:47:59,419
concluded that there is no evidence the

1172
00:47:56,869 --> 00:48:02,029
cannabis treats pain so doctors will

1173
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:03,950
choose the story that they think sits

1174
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:06,019
there narrative and this is the problem

1175
00:48:03,949 --> 00:48:08,299
they're looking at the same studies it's

1176
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:10,130
the same body of data it astonishes me

1177
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:11,870
that you can have groups and some of

1178
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:13,610
them came out of out of Germany some of

1179
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:16,099
them are the European pain Federation's

1180
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:17,780
they've come come out Australian groups

1181
00:48:16,099 --> 00:48:19,909
have come up with these conclusions that

1182
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:22,340
suggests that the evidence is not that

1183
00:48:19,909 --> 00:48:25,250
strong so you have this conflicting

1184
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:27,740
opinion out there and doctors are still

1185
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:30,500
polarized I hear you the evidence

1186
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:32,299
appears you know quite comprehensive but

1187
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,530
it's not the clinical trial stuff and

1188
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,630
they will always point to the lack of

1189
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:37,400
randomized control trials that's still

1190
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:38,990
the currency that they need to speak

1191
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,570
that's the lack of evidence that they're

1192
00:48:38,989 --> 00:48:44,029
talking about in Sebastian what's the

1193
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:47,059
last word I just want to say two

1194
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:49,130
sentences to both of you basically in

1195
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:52,759
Germany I think it's really important

1196
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:55,280
also because of what Mark said before

1197
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:57,500
that we give balanced information that

1198
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:00,680
we are very careful not to seem to

1199
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:03,380
advertise not to exaggerated claims so

1200
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:05,449
that's as a general recommendation to

1201
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:09,590
everybody out there here there's people

1202
00:49:05,449 --> 00:49:12,049
are specifically skeptic about the whole

1203
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:14,000
Pharma system and pharma companies doing

1204
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:17,450
damage and I think that's what we are we

1205
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,789
stand for to give out balanced detailed

1206
00:49:17,449 --> 00:49:21,769
and well to be well informed and that's

1207
00:49:19,789 --> 00:49:23,769
that's something that you should always

1208
00:49:21,769 --> 00:49:30,619
consider doing here in Germany I think

1209
00:49:23,769 --> 00:49:32,539
and that there is Eliza from cannabis at

1210
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:35,449
Columbia this is a question for mr.

1211
00:49:32,539 --> 00:49:38,659
Schultz why is it Jacana is so expensive

1212
00:49:35,449 --> 00:49:41,029
in Germany you said that pharmacists

1213
00:49:38,659 --> 00:49:44,480
they have to add double the price why is

1214
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:47,000
that well that comes because of the

1215
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,740
classification of cannabis as an

1216
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,449
ingredient so it goes to the pharmacy

1217
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:54,139
and the pharmacists have to do an

1218
00:49:50,449 --> 00:49:56,869
identity test and so according to their

1219
00:49:54,139 --> 00:49:59,389
statues they they put a hundred percent

1220
00:49:56,869 --> 00:50:02,509
price up charge the new law is supposed

1221
00:49:59,389 --> 00:50:04,129
to bring that price down also we don't

1222
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:07,610
know how that's going to happen because

1223
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:09,530
there's no specific thing that's written

1224
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:13,010
in the draft of the new law but I think

1225
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:15,320
there's a big political will now to to

1226
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:17,120
get the price down off of cannabis in

1227
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:19,730
Germany because like I said it's it's a

1228
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:23,089
gram of medical cannabis flowers now

1229
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:26,240
cost in Germany around 22 euros or so so

1230
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:29,690
that's that's a lot listen you can call

1231
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:33,529
me I know a guy did it for you like 12

1232
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:37,070
euros I mean no you don't call me like

1233
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:39,800
you know just send me a message I'll

1234
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:41,240
relay it that's it thank you all very

1235
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:44,530
much let's hear it again for this

1236
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:44,529
wonderful fabulous panel
