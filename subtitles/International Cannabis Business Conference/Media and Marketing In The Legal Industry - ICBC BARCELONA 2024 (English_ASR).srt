heard of uh we've been on many shows

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,080
here and uh we choose a bit different

52
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,840
approach on how we want to sell our

53
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,319
products how we want to present our

54

started this uh six and a half years ago

57
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:30,479
s years ago and um my background comes

58
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:34,598
from architecture so I uh

59
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:37,039
chose similar architectural approach to

60
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:41,039
building a brand and building uh and

61
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:42,959
making products producing products so uh

62
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,959
I don't deal with electricians and

63
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:50,199
Carpenters anymore so uh and I started

64
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,959
doing this uh with chemists and

65
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:56,119
cosmetologists and medical PhD doctors

66
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:59,878
so it's kind of a same thing with

67
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:02,680
different packaging so happy to be here

humor as a tool to um make our content

80
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,519
approachable by a community that has an

81
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,199
urgent need of tech technical

82
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:49,360
information educational information both

83
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:51,719
in B2B and b2c uh and we are one of the

84
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,200
largest uh digital communities in the

85
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:56,519
world for cannabis yes thank you s and

86
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,639
you've just come stra from the airport

87
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,599
right so if you start to fall asleep

88
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:04,158
I'll I'll punch you

89
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:05,798
um so I think in in in the first place

90
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,438
I'd like to go to again a more general

91
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:08,799
question I think we heard this morning

92
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:10,199
already that you know it's an

93
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,200
interesting time for the industry I

94
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,280
think some people would say a

95
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,798
challenging time you know regulations

96
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,478
are not moving perhaps as quickly um as

97
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:20,239
some had hoped revenues again that

98
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,839
Revenue growth is moderating to some

99
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,039
extent across different markets

100
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:27,679
categories Etc so the first question I

101
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,960
guess is in terms of what that means for

102
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,240
marketing how does Marketing address add

103
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:34,239
that issue what has changed in the last

104
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,680
sort of 12 to 18 months around the way

105
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,120
you you address or approach media and

106
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,680
marketing and and maybe patri if I can

107
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,800
start with you from a brand perspective

108
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,038
um how are you kind of approaching it

109
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,960
currently in terms of the current

110
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:50,560
atmosphere and context in the

111
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:53,000
industry um from Brand perspective we

112
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,240
started uh when we started it was a lot

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,120
of thinking of how we should do it

114
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:01,000
because there were so many

115
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:05,399
limitations and um we were

116
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,120
definitely not wanting to address the

117
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:10,560
influencers with only one reason because

118
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,280
we didn't want our products to be second

119
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:18,360
best the next time when other people

120
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:21,439
come and pay more or or uh pay different

121
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:25,600
amounts of money that we did so that was

122
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:28,199
a big no no for us so how do it then and

123
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,360
uh it was really interesting step

124
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:34,038
because social media bursted so much and

125
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,120
there was no other way to to do it and

126
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:40,360
the covid was in all this time so there

127
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:44,280
were no shows and nothing like this so

128
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:47,479
we choose uh a different uh approach and

129
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:50,959
the for local for I would say local for

130
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:54,918
Slovenia we used approach to go to mass

131
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:58,198
Market MH so we were in selling in

132
00:05:54,918 --> 00:06:00,680
hundreds of hundreds of shops in

133
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:04,478
Slovenia in every village you could buy

134
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:08,120
Nabi products and that was the biggest

135
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:13,758
way to uh for us it was a really nice

136
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:17,680
way to be presented somewhere and to to

137
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,038
um to show ourselves to to get noticed

138
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,439
so brand awareness is something that

139
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:25,439
people should get and it's hard for to

140
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:27,478
to to be noticed if you're not there so

141
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:30,959
for Slovenia this was a really crucial

142
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:34,038
thing and we have a shop in lublana also

143
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:38,159
which is a really we we we got the shop

144
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:40,519
for marketing reasons um it turned out

145
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,800
that it was also a good selling point

146
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:48,680
because of all the tourists and every

147
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:52,000
people there um and regarding uh abroad

148
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:54,000
we choose shows so for example shows

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,199
like this AC uh

150
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,399
IBC we we're here always we just had a

151
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:03,639
joke back there when hi you're still

152
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:05,878
here and

153
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,560
congratulations which is kind of a big

154
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:11,199
thing in cannabis business when you

155
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,319
survive from year to year we managed to

156
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:18,240
survive and we developed really well in

157
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:21,080
these times um and also thankfully with

158
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,319
this kind of events we are able to

159
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:30,359
present ourselves as a partner that is

160
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:32,360
um worth doing business with and that we

161
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,879
show ourselves in different perspective

162
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:38,800
that people see uh that we differ and

163
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:41,560
stand out standing out as I mention now

164
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,560
uh is something that is really important

165
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:48,560
uh in this kind of business um we try to

166
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,319
stand out with packaging that we use we

167
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,959
try to stand out with ingredients that

168
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,439
we use with the approach that we have so

169
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:59,560
it's kind of finding a way to differ I'm

170
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:03,038
sure that everybody here knows what I'm

171
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:06,439
talking about and everybody there um

172
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:09,240
that is really important to um put a

173
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:11,079
point on yourself and say okay this is

174
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,240
something that we do and it's different

175
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:15,839
from everything else you have this is

176
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,280
the most challenging thing to do in this

177
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,839
kind of business but um I think we did

178
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:22,198
pretty good job till now yes and I guess

179
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:23,878
the more challenging the industry in

180
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,000
general becomes the more important it is

181
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,080
to be distinctive Etc I think we can

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,478
maybe come back to that uh Simon from an

183
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:33,360
agency perspective and again in in terms

184
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,038
of a more constrained environment and

185
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,959
and challenges that the industry face

186
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:38,598
how does that play out for you from an

187
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,559
agency perspective how can you

188
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,560
contribute uh and what kind of problems

189
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,199
are you solving for your for your

190
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:47,159
partners

191
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,720
um yeah um I think it's it's a great

192
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:52,120
question we've been talking about this

193
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:55,080
for for a bit now and I'm sure many of

194
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,600
us if we are company owners in the

195
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,320
Cannabis industry wherever you're from

196
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,040
you've suffer quite a bit chances are

197
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,480
these past years have not been the best

198
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:07,639
for our industry so exclusively talking

199
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,759
about a marketing perspective in this

200
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:14,278
area we've seen um marketing budgets

201
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:17,078
shrinking many people aren't able to

202
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:19,720
allocate as much money or assets or

203
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:22,239
resources on marketing which means also

204
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,720
that they are letting go of some

205
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,320
specific markets that require that

206
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,920
marketing campaign set in place for them

207
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,399
to be able to capitalize over those

208
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:36,240
efforts on over the immense effort which

209
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,919
is building a brand in this space and in

210
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,560
addition to that we've seen all the

211
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,719
restrictions that come from everywhere

212
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,639
now I think Michael have a really good

213
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,079
point on on a really good pers

214
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,559
perspective on what's happening in

215
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:52,278
Germany but we've also we all known or

216
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:54,319
we've all have our accounts taken down

217
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:57,039
in social media I'm sure like you've

218
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,720
seen that going it's hard to get any

219
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,039
kind of cannabis content out there

220
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:05,560
without being highly restriced Shadow

221
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:08,679
bun or uh just taking down so we've

222
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:12,159
found some things in this in this very

223
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:14,479
intricated uh maze they're not stable

224
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:17,000
though it changes because like the

225
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,839
guidelines for social media change so it

226
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,958
is challenging and it requires for us to

227
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,880
be updated and it requires for us to be

228
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:27,759
you know uh flexible also to be

229
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:31,399
everywhere to understand how different

230
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:34,958
platforms work so so but we what is also

231
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:39,120
very interesting for me in this um

232
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:41,159
crisis I would presume it could be like

233
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't know if that's such a dramatic

234
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:45,919
word but it is it is it's been hard so I

235
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,839
know like we all seen it and we all have

236
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:50,719
friends in the space so we know how it

237
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,399
is um but it's also a really good

238
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,759
opportunity for companies that are

239
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:58,320
looking into the marketing space

240
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:01,078
understanding that many other many

241
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,760
companies that had in house marketing uh

242
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:06,679
branches are not going to be able to

243
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:09,439
continue with that so uh a lot of uh the

244
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:12,239
resources are moving to Outsourcing this

245
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,920
marketing resources so it's h an

246
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,240
interesting opportunity for companies

247
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:19,240
that are moving there to have high

248
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,560
margin assets to provide for our

249
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:25,680
industry so I would say those are the

250
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:27,759
two main areas in which we've been

251
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,638
developing and investigating these past

252
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:33,759
few years trying to be a better asset

253
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,759
for our fellow colleagues MH very

254
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,319
interesting so M I know you have

255
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,120
particular experience with social media

256
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,959
and so on and I want to get to that uh

257
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,360
in a few moments but just before we get

258
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,919
to that and sticking with kind of the

259
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,240
theme of challenges um there may be

260
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:48,799
people in the audience uh who don't know

261
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,799
exactly what will be possible or not

262
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,599
possible in the German context moving

263
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:56,679
forward um once we have kji and so on so

264
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,680
can you just talk a little bit about um

265
00:11:56,679 --> 00:12:00,359
I think largely what won't be possible

266
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:02,439
in the German context but just so we're

267
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,320
all clear on on that from a marketing

268
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,720
perspective it's I can say it in quite

269
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,879
easy words uh we used to Canabis used to

270
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,959
be a part of the narcotic act which

271
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:15,958
meant that you were not allowed to

272
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:18,439
advertise for cannabis but which in

273
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:21,919
reality meant you were not allowed to

274
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:25,519
advertise strains but companies were

275
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:28,799
allowed to advertise the brand which is

276
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:31,000
a a smart marketing uh approach uh had

277
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:35,039
uh was needed

278
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,839
to let me say Focus certain straints but

279
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:40,240
it's it's possible it was possible and

280
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,680
now that cannabis is out of the narcotic

281
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,879
act and into the new cannabis act it's

282
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:47,198
not unregulated but it's out of the

283
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:50,360
narcotic act and into the new cannabis

284
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:52,599
act but when it comes to advertising

285
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:56,360
it's actually the same like before like

286
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:59,720
it was in the narcotic act but the new

287
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:03,039
law mentions for example influen which

288
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:06,000
was not mentioned before in the which

289
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,639
which we call pharmaceutical uh uh

290
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,078
advertisement law we have a

291
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:13,440
pharmaceutical advertisement uh uh

292
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:15,479
Prohibition in Germany it's not allowed

293
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,160
and but pharmaceutical companies are

294
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,519
allowed to advertise for their company

295
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,319
for their brand and actually now for

296
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,839
cannabis for recreational Cannabis it's

297
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:28,120
all the same but influencing is included

298
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:31,079
so uh we have to find uh of course nice

299
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,320
uh smart worker rounds in my eyes uh

300
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:37,078
which means brand should focus on their

301
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:39,639
brand uh I have a nice example for the

302
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:42,599
alcohol brand for alcohol branding for

303
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:45,278
example uh all the big beer companies

304
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,800
they sponsor spots event spot uh spot

305
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:50,320
events but it's not allowed to advertise

306
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:52,679
for alcohol on sport events of course so

307
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,399
what are they doing they bring out the

308
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:57,559
alcohol free brand which has the same

309
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:00,320
logo like the alcohol brand or it's red

310
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:02,799
instead of blue and then it's uh allowed

311
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,399
to work to advertise for alcohol-free

312
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:08,799
beer on a sports event and uh I must

313
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,320
just come come back to Petra and I have

314
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:16,120
to contradict a little

315
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:18,519
because um drama if if any company does

316
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:22,639
their marketing themselves we wouldn't

317
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:26,278
sit here so in my eyes also on a small

318
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,959
level in nowadays a smart influencer

319
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:30,159
marketing a smart social media it

320
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:32,919
doesn't have to be done by influencers

321
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:35,958
but the smart smart social media

322
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:38,198
marketing has a very big impact what I

323
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:40,399
must agree on that in a small country

324
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:43,120
like Slovenia you have a lot of other

325
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,519
marketing strategies which you can use

326
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,078
because it's a small country but

327
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,839
compared to Spain or to Germany it

328
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:51,919
wouldn't be possible to do this kind of

329
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,519
marketing what would would it direct

330
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:55,159
trade marketing is different difficult

331
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,120
scale yeah so I want to give Patra right

332
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:58,439
of reply on on that so Petra can you

333
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,600
just talk a little bit about how you use

334
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,440
social media and maybe some kind of key

335
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,159
tips for for anyone in the audience

336
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,240
about approaching social media as a

337
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:09,879
cannabis brand I would agree uh with

338
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:14,360
what you had to say Michael um

339
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:17,360
because maybe I said influencers um a

340
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:20,079
bit hard it's a bit harsh to to to get

341
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,879
it to all influencers because I was

342
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:26,319
addressing to the paid ones that are

343
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:29,519
selling one product today and the other

344
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,079
product tomorrow so this is the only

345
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:35,399
uh thing that I was addressing um but

346
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:39,399
there are many ways to use influencers

347
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:43,120
in a smart way like you said and

348
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:47,240
uh combining your I don't know ideas

349
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,078
with a really known person or or doing

350
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:53,799
something with that it's completely

351
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:55,838
different thing so um for us our um uh

352
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:59,559
social media approach was a bit

353
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:02,959
different and uh also marketing approach

354
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:07,278
uh regarding how we will present that

355
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:11,359
our products are really good um so we

356
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:13,639
choose the approach to to tell people

357
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,600
about the feel that they get from our

358
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:19,159
product not what this product does but

359
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,759
you you you you you you try it and you

360
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:24,679
feel it and you will feel it and um it

361
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:28,000
it was a bit different because everybody

362
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:30,359
was saying about anti- wrinkle this does

363
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,839
this and this does do that and every

364
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,159
product has claims on what it does we

365
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:38,040
couldn't say anything about CBD so how

366
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:41,240
to do it if you cannot say anything and

367
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:45,399
we choose to talk about the Feld and

368
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:47,879
it's showing off that we are um gaining

369
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:50,039
a lot of followers just because we are

370
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:53,799
talking about the fields different kind

371
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:56,000
of fields so how could you sleep um how

372
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:59,679
how do you dream if you can sleep for

373
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,559
example is one of our um things with and

374
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:04,720
you get a product for that and uh it

375
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:08,519
doesn't say that it will help you sleep

376
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:13,199
but it says it in a in a different way

377
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:17,318
so uh this was kind of a um way that we

378
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:20,038
tried to to get through all the the the

379
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:24,038
Banning that happens and so on and

380
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:26,838
people actually share our content that's

381
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:30,558
I think uh Simon will have a lot to say

382
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:33,038
I follow Simon and his every where and

383
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:35,558
everybody's um sharing your content

384
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:39,119
which is really interesting and he has

385
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:42,279
so special approach so it's kind of

386
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:44,479
again to differ and to stand out that's

387
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:46,079
all the magic it's almost like patri if

388
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,919
it sounds like you're using poetry or

389
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:49,839
something to to to be distinctive and

390
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,360
and ask people see on you use humor a

391
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,918
lot in in the work that you and your

392
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,959
agency does and the the point of that I

393
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:58,840
guess is not just to be funny it's

394
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,360
because that enhances the quality of the

395
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:03,359
interactions you're getting on on the

396
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:04,519
social media sites and and prevents or

397
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:05,918
protects you a little bit from things

398
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:08,759
like Shadow Banning and all that sort of

399
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,840
stuff is that is that correct yeah uh it

400
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:15,480
it has many layers I would say uh and

401
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:18,000
thank you for your words um what we use

402
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,319
actually what we're based on is science

403
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,519
it's all fully educational content and

404
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:26,279
that's something that can Transit and

405
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,879
and move through social media without as

406
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:31,678
many restrictions as like other

407
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,600
marketing content for cannabis products

408
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,320
this should be very well known by this

409
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:40,038
point educational content if it's uh

410
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:42,480
marked and tagged as educational content

411
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:46,359
have like way more chances to not be

412
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:50,880
Shadow Bann or deleted from at any given

413
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:54,119
platform that being said humor has also

414
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,799
like a different perspective and and and

415
00:18:54,119 --> 00:19:01,439
some many other layers for starters um

416
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:05,639
we know that we cannot uh paid for

417
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,798
promotion so chances are that if we have

418
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,960
a cannabis account a Canabis social

419
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:13,319
media account we're going to need

420
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,960
organic following and organic engage

421
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:17,798
engagement this is something that's also

422
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,440
basic and should be very well known at

423
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:23,519
this point that all your resources need

424
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:26,080
to be allocated in this form of uh

425
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,200
distribution for social media content or

426
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:31,720
Audi visual content for that matter and

427
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,000
then this is something that that it's a

428
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,960
little bit more hard to measure but I

429
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,519
think it our experience can tell us that

430
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,960
there's something else in our community

431
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:46,319
that is uh something a little bit more

432
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:50,880
untangle but not less real uh which is

433
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:54,279
our own culture and our own culture has

434
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:58,080
a comedy background that has been lying

435
00:19:54,279 --> 00:20:01,399
there forever it was comedians who were

436
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:04,119
among the first activist for cannabis

437
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:07,038
just as much as like the hipop urban

438
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:10,279
culture as well but they're they've been

439
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:12,679
there and we have and I I would I I

440
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:16,119
would uh say this for for all of us I

441
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:18,600
hope I'm right I'm not trying to uh put

442
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:22,678
words in anybody's mouth but um I think

443
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:27,798
we have uh predilection for for uh

444
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:31,038
laughter and we look uh for um health

445
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:32,798
and for for for a medical experience

446
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:35,558
also in laughter because it has helped

447
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:38,639
us uh deal with a lot of what

448
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:41,639
prohibition and stigma has done in us

449
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,200
and and comedy and humor it's a

450
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,960
therapeutical form of culture as well

451
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:49,558
and I think that like that's not

452
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,720
necessarily explained uh but it's

453
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:55,480
something that is also like lying there

454
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,720
and is inherent to our culture and we

455
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:01,880
tapped into that and we noticed that

456
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,720
when you laugh you share and that's

457
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,960
something that you cannot pay for in

458
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,720
like advertisement so that's an

459
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,200
interesting tool that we've been using

460
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,679
and we' we try to make science funny uh

461
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,480
we try to make it approachable we try to

462
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:21,440
talk to our community in a very genuine

463
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:23,319
way the way we are uh and this is also

464
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,320
very important and should be very well

465
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:29,000
known by now after we've seen what

466
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:32,158
happened with uh celebrity brands in our

467
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,880
industry we all we've all seen it right

468
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,039
there are exceptions of course but we

469
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:41,720
all know what happens there so being

470
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:44,400
like legit I would say or or genuine and

471
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,880
coherent to the community something that

472
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,038
that humor does very well for us and I I

473
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,640
guess it might also be the case that

474
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:51,798
cannabis users have a very high

475
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,200
detection level for inauthenticity as

476
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:56,639
well so I mean speaking of being

477
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,120
authentically yourself M can I ask you

478
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,960
to just talk a little bit about your

479
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:01,599
experience with social media some of the

480
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,038
challenges you've had and how you kind

481
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:05,879
of it's an ongoing process I guess in

482
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:09,038
terms of of continuing to try and get

483
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,320
your message across and be heard Etc uh

484
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:11,798
when it comes to cannabis there are a

485
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:15,798
lot of challenges there are legal

486
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:19,440
challenges uh there stigma there's

487
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:21,440
stigmatizing challenges so all in all

488
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,919
and I would say you have to be a

489
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,640
Storyteller influencers or they have to

490
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,559
be a Storyteller you have to build a

491
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,278
story around your brand around your

492
00:22:27,558 --> 00:22:32,399
product the people people want to listen

493
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:34,919
to and uh not the product has to be

494
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,679
really in Focus you know it has doesn't

495
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:38,600
have to be in Focus the the most

496
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:40,080
important thing is your story you know

497
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:42,119
and of course the product has to be

498
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,639
mentioned and everybody has to know what

499
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:46,558
it's about your story but the story is

500
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,159
much more important than the rest and

501
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:49,798
this is also what I say we are good

502
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,679
storytellers as influencers you know

503
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:53,679
you're comedian so we we are

504
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,720
professional storytellers so if anybody

505
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,679
of your companies has a good Storyteller

506
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,038
who can act in front of the camera make

507
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,798
him your your social media influencer if

508
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:04,319
your company doesn't have one you should

509
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,319
really think about social media

510
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:08,918
marketing because social media marketing

511
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,720
is the most most U um attractive

512
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:12,640
marketing uh the most successful

513
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,720
marketing at the moment and it will this

514
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,120
will not change anymore I used to be an

515
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,400
author I used to uh publish a hemp

516
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:22,599
cannabis magazine in 2004 we started and

517
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,278
that was a very s successful model

518
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:27,199
meanwhile all cannabis magazines are

519
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:30,240
fighting to survive you know and uh even

520
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,000
micro influ influ ERS have an income

521
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,839
while the big magazines struggle to

522
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,599
survive so there is there is no way back

523
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:39,759
and because cannabis is so limited uh we

524
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:43,000
have to tell stories and in the stories

525
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:45,240
we have to avoid everything why cannabis

526
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,278
is stigmatized so and and influencers

527
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,599
now to do that they are Professionals in

528
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:53,319
that so if you need a product to be uh

529
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:55,839
promoted legally and with a nice story

530
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:58,599
asking professional influencer to do

531
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:01,278
that direct question I guess how often

532
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:03,480
do you find yourself Shadow ban and when

533
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:05,038
that happens how do you deal with it how

534
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,480
do you make sure it doesn't happen in

535
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:09,919
the first place meanwhile I have more

536
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,880
problems that a lot of my customers are

537
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,080
Shadow

538
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:17,360
banned I'm kind of experienced I I I I

539
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:19,359
know what what I can do in social media

540
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:21,959
and what not but my customers they are

541
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:25,000
not as experienced as I am and for

542
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,000
example on Instagram I had three

543
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,519
customers being shadowbanned within the

544
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,960
last three month then I can of course

545
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:35,038
not fulfill my contract I have with them

546
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:37,120
so I also say if you are my customer you

547
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,038
also have to care about your own shadow

548
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:42,158
bands and how you act on social media as

549
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:43,839
a company because if you spend money on

550
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,720
influencing and your own account is

551
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:49,319
Shadow band The influencer cannot do

552
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,720
anything and this is very tricky so uh

553
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:53,200
this is not uh a lot of people think

554
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,600
because they have a private Instagram

555
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,000
which is running quite well okay I I do

556
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:00,719
my I do my business Instagram myself and

557
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,960
uh no you have to this is a real

558
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,120
professional job and even I employ

559
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,759
people for my Instagram account and for

560
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:09,038
my Facebook account and for my YouTube

561
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:11,319
account because it's a very very uh

562
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:13,278
complicated and and and it takes it's

563
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:15,158
complicated and takes a lot of time to

564
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:16,640
run it and you don't see it if if if if

565
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:18,600
you click on my account you don't see

566
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,919
that but there's a lot of work and money

567
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:23,519
behind it and uh this is why uh

568
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:25,559
influencing is not so cheap as uh a lot

569
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,679
of people expect that not as easy as it

570
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:29,000
looks obviously so we've got just less

571
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,679
than 10 minutes left so I just want to

572
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,240
make sure that we we get some questions

573
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:34,600
from the audience if there are so if you

574
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,599
can put your hands up uh anyone wants to

575
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:37,599
ask so there's one

576
00:25:41,558 --> 00:25:45,798
here it'll happen there you go let's

577
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:49,200
hear it for the

578
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:49,200
panel you had a

579
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:57,200
question uh hello um I'm coming from a

580
00:25:52,880 --> 00:26:00,320
legal background here when you plan or

581
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:03,240
brainstorm on advertis ing on social

582
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:05,759
media do you usually look at terms and

583
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:09,240
condition of Facebook Instagram and what

584
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:10,919
do they say on cannabis or CBD or

585
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,278
because that's that's something you

586
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:15,440
always need to look

587
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:19,038
at as an influencer for me it's hard to

588
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:21,600
communicate with them there are also no

589
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:24,119
uh strict rules or no real rules about

590
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:26,839
cannabis marketing because every country

591
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:30,000
country has its own law so Facebook

592
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:32,759
YouTube uh m and you Google they decided

593
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,319
to make their own cannabis uh uh rules

594
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:38,079
which they do not really communicate

595
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:39,759
it's only about soft drugs you and I

596
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:41,678
know what I'm allowed to do and what I'm

597
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:44,319
not allowed to do but I cannot look it

598
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:48,000
look it up in a book so I have to find a

599
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:51,200
trial and error and uh meanwhile I I I'm

600
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,440
I'm expert in the trial and error

601
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,399
principle and I don't get I I didn't get

602
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,360
a strike for I think one and a half

603
00:26:56,398 --> 00:27:02,678
years and I didn't get a shadow ban for

604
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:04,759
I think on Instagram for a year so but

605
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:06,399
only because I'm experienced and there

606
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:10,960
are even words here are not allowed to

607
00:27:06,398 --> 00:27:13,558
use now it's It's Tricky so uh TR and

608
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,880
error because uh the big companies don't

609
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:17,519
do not commun communicate about this

610
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,240
topic with the influencers they just

611
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,000
don't communicate I even tried it with

612
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:24,200
the manager who's really good well

613
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
connected to YouTube and even they

614
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,440
didn't they didn't talk they didn't

615
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,798
answer his uh his requests uh from I'm a

616
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,679
professional YouTube uh uh manager so I

617
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:34,440
have no idea there's a uh a dispensary

618
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,919
in

619
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,880
Colorado that you're not allowed to do

620
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:40,840
TV ads of your dispensary so they made

621
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,440
tv ads of the businesses next door to

622
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:44,359
them everyone around them yeah right

623
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:47,080
like come and get a pedicure it's right

624
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:47,079
next door to the

625
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,159
dispensary right come and buy a sandwich

626
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:52,278
from this place it's right next door to

627
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:55,278
the

628
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:56,720
dispensary so that that actually worked

629
00:27:55,278 --> 00:28:00,519
uh we have a question over

630
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:05,120
here hi again I am graa the founder of

631
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:06,720
can Portugal and uh I just want to uh to

632
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,599
remind that when it comes to the

633
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:13,159
marketing in the legal industry we need

634
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:17,000
to think that where we are has one of

635
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:20,720
the biggest ways to promote cannabis in

636
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,398
the legal um uh industry because we tend

637
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,798
to forget that

638
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:30,639
forums um uh conferences Expos fairs and

639
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:33,720
so on uh and this is not fair because we

640
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:37,120
are all together and we are sharing our

641
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:41,159
histories and we are doing such a good

642
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:43,599

00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:18,319
constantly challenged with the shifting

656

rules on Instagram and things and so we

657
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:22,639
think uh adding you know stars in

658
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:24,519
between Cana not spelling it correctly

659
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,480
might help us I'm just wondering if you

660
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:30,038
could grace us with maybe your top three

661
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,038
tips to avoid getting shadow baned

662
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:37,360
do you want to disclose that information

663
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:39,679
M try try to avoid the the ver cannabis

664
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:43,479
try to avoid consumption in front of

665
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:47,440
camera and try to avoid anything that

666
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:50,759
might be seen as that it's uh addressed

667
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:53,840
to minors or children anything even the

668
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:56,200
pet or or or something in the picture so

669
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:58,240
those three things I noticed on my

670
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,919
account that if I post a a silly

671
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,399
cannabis meme right Instagram doesn't

672
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,679
care they'll they'll send it out to

673
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:08,158
everybody but if I post a picture of

674
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,559
cannabis and say I got this from these

675
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,039
people then they're like hey hey hey hey

676
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:16,319
you can't do that so you have to find a

677
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:18,558
way to be roundabout you can't just be

678
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:22,599
like come buy the [ __ ] over here and

679
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:26,440
humor as you say humor humor humor's big

680
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:28,519
hum so we we reach over like 2 million

681
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,080
people every month and we have

682
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:33,919
consumption camera and we use the word

683
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:35,038
cannabis and um what was the other thing

684
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,919
you

685
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:40,640
mentioned we do all those three I'm sure

686
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,559
children children children too yeah but

687
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,679
but yeah what what we do also is we T

688
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:48,398
our content as educational cannabis

689
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:52,278
content and we ensure that it is

690
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:55,038
educational we also um uh like Target

691
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:57,038
for over 18 before it's published we

692
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:59,679
don't let YouTube to do the work for us

693
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:01,240
because then you get like uh revised

694
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,759
which is I'm I don't know who I'm

695
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:09,399
looking who was who made the question

696
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:13,398
like and then um we also ensure that as

697
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:16,879
Michael noticed also is not focused on

698
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:19,239
the product or the Cannabis specifically

699
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,639
so that the content is not like a

700
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,159
promotional content for that but it's a

701
00:31:21,638 --> 00:31:26,479
story or it's around something that

702
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,240
congregates you and this is also very

703
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,038
important because it generates creates

704
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,480
way more engagement with your community

705
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:38,119
when you're actually giv something that

706
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,319
uh helps whether it's a tip for how to

707
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:44,518
grow your cannabis or a tutorial on how

708
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:47,359
to uh use a vaporizer or how to uh roll

709
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:50,038
a joint or any of those things something

710
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:52,678
that provides a useful tool for our

711
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:55,240
community it's going to go a long way

712
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:57,559
because we don't have any tools we don't

713
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,519
have any resources that's what's some

714
00:31:57,558 --> 00:32:01,398
what's common in our communi that we

715
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:04,480
don't have the information education

716
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:06,239
there is no universities there's no um a

717
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,440
lot of authorized sources to get

718
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,679
information so every oh nice someone

719
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,759
brought a

720
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:17,639
dog good for you though um I'll take the

721
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:19,398
dog question what you're saying though

722
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:23,839
that question is kind of

723
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:25,839
rough I will answer in barking no um but

724
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:28,798
yeah using these elements providing

725
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:31,278
useful tools providing education assets

726
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:33,918
for the community would generate a

727
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:37,000
deeper engagement and you will know and

728
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:40,320
find out by yourselves that the the how

729
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
deep is this gap of knowledge that we

730
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:44,918
are we're missing and we're eering as a

731
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,159
community all right one last one right

732
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:50,200
here can can I add some yes please um

733
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,440
you didn't like my answer I loved your

734
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,720
answer and I agree totally with that but

735
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:58,840
I would like to add something and that

736
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,360
would be right poetry like you said

737
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:04,480
um poetry I think it's something and let

738
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:07,879
people feel feel what you have to say I

739
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:10,440
think that's one of the things to do on

740
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,080
Instagram or Facebook poetry is good

741
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:16,200
okay what one last question right here

742
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:18,798
I'm sorry poetry is good Chicago um are

743
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:22,679
you guys talking to chat Bots AI chat

744
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:25,200
Bots right now number one and number two

745
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:27,840
what is going to happen with their AI

746
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,360
influence on your work in terms of

747
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:33,038
marketing of cannabis let's say the next

748
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:35,439
two to 5 years someone that sounds like

749
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:36,879
one for you correct me if I'm wrong

750
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,320
that's a really good question we we

751
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,799
didn't speak about AI but it's it's a

752
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:45,359
major thing of course I'm sure we've all

753
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:47,839
aware of what it can do for us in so

754
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:52,759
many aspects there's an AI for

755
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:55,240
everything now uh generating SEO uh

756
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:57,798
what's the word optimize sorry SEO

757
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,839
optimized text for cannabis without

758
00:33:57,798 --> 00:34:04,079
using the word cannabis could be one

759
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:06,959
thing uh but I can speak about our

760
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:11,639
experience as company so as soon as like

761
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:16,320
the first uh GPT came out I I hired

762
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:19,079
someone to to actually um train our

763
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,159
stuff in AI so we're using it on daily

764
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:24,919
basis we actually use uh to create video

765
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:28,039
that has cannabis backgrounds

766
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:31,039
self-generated or so so we are using it

767
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:34,358
now and it can be very helpful to uh

768
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:36,119
avoid mistakes when creating content for

769
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:37,639
for starters I don't know if that

770
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:39,480
answers the question that you did will

771
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:42,280
it ever write poetry though is the

772
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,480
question what will it ever write poetry

773
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,320
I I've asked like I'm I'm a writer

774
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,480
myself so I I I try to do some poetry in

775
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,519
GPT and still sucks I'm sure it's going

776
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:56,199
to get better but it's it's really bad

777
00:34:51,519 --> 00:35:00,079
poetry so far so I you're safe me not so

778
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:03,559
much no but as long as we use it in in

779
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:06,000
in a creative way I think it can be can

780
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:07,880
be a lot of help we are using it right

781
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,719
now and we have a few shows that you can

782
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:14,640
see how we use it it's not the the

783
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:14,639
content it's it's a tool

784
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:28,199
right check high as hell in Spain

785
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,519
