8
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,480
watching Berlin grow to what it is today

9
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,339
and uh I've been doing this now for

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,379
almost 10 years in the legal industry

11
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:24,118
now I have an Edibles contract

12
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:26,640
manufacturer in Canada and a pharmacy

13
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:28,079
called hybrid farm and I'm gonna let my

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,099
awesome panelists introduce themselves

15
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,618
go ahead Phil

16
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:34,679
hi guys my name is Philip I work for

17
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:36,359
carterage it's not my first rodeo in

18
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,219
cannabis I started in the Cannabis

19
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:40,259
industry in 2017.

20
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,000
I joined pedanus which was the first

21
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:44,280
cannabis Wholesale in Europe which was

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,558
later acquired by Aurora and I became

23
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,200
the managing director for Aurora Europe

24
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:52,019
and built a European platform for Aurora

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,940
as we all know Aurora had a quite unique

26
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,280
operating model vertically integrated

27
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:58,500
from sea to sale

28
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,198
and then with kantaraj we came up with a

29
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,140
new operating model which is at least to

30
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:07,200
me quite unique it allows us to partner

31
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,478
with any legal grower worldwide bring

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,180
their cannabis to Germany manufactured

33
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:13,640
here according to EU GMP and then sell

34
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,439
it all over Europe

35
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,780
as of today we've signed long-term

36
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:20,459
agreements with more than 50 cultivators

37
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,560
from 18 countries

38
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:25,739
and brought cannabis flowers from

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,519
Jamaica Uganda Uruguay Portugal Spain

40
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:32,339
into German and UK pharmacies so that's

41
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,679
quite unique it definitely improved at

42
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,359
least from our perspective the quality

43
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,259
of flour currently available in Europe

44
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:44,340
and it also shows in our development we

45
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:46,859
went public last year in November and so

46
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,140
far we've been growing steadily and

47
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,759
we're one of the few companies I think

48
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,859
in Europe but also worldwide that's

49
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,079
actually already profitable

50
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:56,938
so very happy to talk about counter rash

51
00:01:55,078 --> 00:02:00,019
today but also any types of questions

52
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:00,019
you'll throw at me

53
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,899
Kiora everyone my name is Carmen Darren

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,060
I'm the CEO of Helios Therapeutics which

55
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,818
is New Zealand's largest producer of

56
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,580
medicinal cannabis so Helios is a

57
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:16,859
medicines company we exist to improve

58
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,800
the quality of life of those underserved

59
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:23,400
by conventional Pharmaceuticals we are

60
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:27,060
vertically integrated EU GMP end to end

61
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,760
as well as gacp a little bit about our

62
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:33,300
journey so hillius was first founded in

63
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:36,840
2018. uh we entered the New Zealand

64
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,819
Market back in 2021 and last year we

65
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,120
brought new zealand-grown New Zealand

66
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:43,799
made medicines to our kiwi patients for

67
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,180
us now the next step is bringing those

68
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,420
new zealand-grown New Zealand made

69
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,040
medicines to the rest of the world and

70
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:52,259
happy to be here and talking to people

71
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:55,259
about that today

72
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:57,659
from an investment story perspective we

73
00:02:55,259 --> 00:03:00,419
are 100 New Zealand owned currently

74
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:03,120
we've had 60 million dollars invested

75
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:06,059
into Helios 60 million New Zealand

76
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,420
Dollars which is around 40 million euros

77
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,640
all through private investment so

78
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:12,839
individuals who are very passionate

79
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:15,958
about

80
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,819
the health journey of our patients in

81
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,219
New Zealand they have high expectations

82
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:23,518
but they also understand the long game

83
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:25,800
around making medicines and I think that

84
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,900
that's a really interesting point that I

85
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,360
can bring to the panel today

86
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,800
um I brought 20 IMS with me today

87
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,599
they're all sitting out in the table

88
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,519
there's two left so that means there's

89
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,818
18 people out there thinking about

90
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,500
investing in New Zealand we are at the

91
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:42,598
moment taking expressions of interest

92
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,139
for a capital raise later in the year

93
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:48,298
for 5 million New Zealand Dollars the

94
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:50,098
interesting thing if anyone really loves

95
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,080
New Zealand and wants to come and live

96
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:54,119
there is if you invest five million

97
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,099
dollars into Helios the New Zealand

98
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,719
government will give you a Visa and you

99
00:03:56,098 --> 00:03:59,518
can come and live in New Zealand so

100

00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,780
what we can do come see Carmen

106
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:15,179
um well first of all it's an absolute

107
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,298
pleasure to be on stage with you a

108
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,918
gentleman lady Luke richner it's my name

109
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:22,739
I'm from Switzerland

110
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:25,019
um I'm the co-founder and CEO of a tech

111
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,780
company in this space called canavigia

112
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:30,959
where we looked at the global supply

113
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:32,819
chain we identified a couple of issues

114
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,579
that are lack of harmonization

115
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:36,719
standardization and all the the sexy

116
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:38,459
things in the back end that everybody

117
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,860
loves thinking about and putting in the

118
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:43,560
center and found kind of a common

119
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,360
denominator there understanding that not

120
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,240
everything the US does works on a global

121
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,479
scale and created a software from

122
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,478
scratch fast forward today we by

123
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:56,579
coincidence 18 countries as of next week

124
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,800
actually 19 they are not the same

125
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:00,659
countries yet maybe we'll talk about

126
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,520
that later

127
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,919
um I think our main

128
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,299
hate the term clade to fame but we have

129
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:09,839
a 10-year contract with the Swiss Health

130
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:12,478
Ministry for all the pilot projects so

131
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,099
which is the exemption status towards

132
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,319
the single convention in the U.N that

133
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,180
allows for a slow approach towards

134
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,279
legalization the same way Germany is

135
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,879
going with model projects and and

136
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:25,559
Holland is going that direction too and

137
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:27,060
um fun fact we're also doing around

138
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,220
right now so if anybody has any

139
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,339
questions afterwards no Brokers please

140
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,800

yeah we're um you know we're going to

145
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,119
start with talking about the exit part

146
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:47,879
of this uh there is one panelist here

147
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,399
that quote unquote exited but you know

148
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:51,779
people don't understand exiting is not

149
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,038
like okay hey thank you very much

150
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:54,719
there's a bunch of money and I can just

151
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,819
go hang out on a beach and just sip

152
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,860
Margaritas uh that gentleman is right

153
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:00,599
here to my left Phillip went Pub they

154
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,060
went public recently A lot of people

155
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,280
look at that as an exit can you quickly

156
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,079
talk about the uh kind of the process

157
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,418
there and does it feel like an exit

158
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:12,139
because I I'm gonna guess it doesn't and

159
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:12,139
talk about tomorrow

160
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,740
um yeah it doesn't feel like it actually

161
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:18,899
but it was never meant to be at the end

162
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,400
of the day um I just mentioned the first

163
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:22,739
company I worked for was acquired by

164
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,359
Aurora there was a proper exit and then

165
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,199
you had lots and lots of cooks in the

166
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,840
kitchen

167
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,000
uh this time around we wanted to stay in

168
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,439
the driver's seat so the the founders

169
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,199
and the management team we still own

170
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,000
more than 75 of the company

171
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,000
which is also a testament of what we did

172
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,759
before as we raised less than 5 million

173
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
in order to come to a market cap as of

174
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,280
today of roughly 130 uh so we believe in

175
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,220
being a bootstrap company we believe in

176
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,318
profitable growth and we thought being

177
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,060
at the Capital Market gives us ample

178
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,220
opportunity to raise money quickly if

179
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,478
it's needed so if there is an exciting

180
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,699
opportunity

181
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:01,978
and nothing against you guys but talking

182
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:04,080
to investors for three to six months

183
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:07,079
doing due diligence after the other

184
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,579
maybe the opportunity is gone given it's

185
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:10,318
a highly Dynamic it's a really

186
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:12,538
Innovative market and if a New Market

187
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,360
opens up I want to be in there and make

188
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:16,860
some money and we thought it's it's good

189
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,319
to have that additional opportunity to

190
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,120
also raise money by the capital markets

191
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,080
that's for sure

192
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,300
um yeah

193
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,818
and we also wanted to give retail

194
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,740
investors especially in Germany the

195
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:32,460
chance to invest into a company rather

196
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,139
early so we also tap in Internet retail

197
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:36,180
investor potential here

198
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:39,538
there's lots and lots of pent-up demand

199
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,759
we sold it so after our listing the

200
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:44,038
price went up and it stayed up there so

201
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,479
it's not like in the US and Canada so

202
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:48,240
there's definitely a high demand by

203
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:50,279
investors in Germany or maybe maybe all

204
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,780
over Europe to invest in an internal

205
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:54,119
company quite early on

206
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:56,159
we're the ones giving them also the

207
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,019
opportunity right and and that's a key

208
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,520
thing to bring up is that when you're

209
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,079
investing in these types of businesses

210
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,180
you're investing in a business I mean

211
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:05,459
coming from Canada people were investing

212
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,720
in dreams and stories and hopes and

213
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:08,159
we're raising hundreds of millions of

214
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,960
dollars with companies that didn't even

215
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,880
have a dollar all three of these people

216
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:14,219
up here have revenues have market share

217
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,319
and now talking about getting some money

218
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,580
it makes perfect sense I know Carmen you

219
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,860
were saying people ask you all the time

220
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:21,120
like what's your exit plan like what's

221
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,740
it like getting asked that all the time

222
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,038
and what do you tell them

223
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,879
so the answer to that is we don't have a

224
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,878
short-term Exit Plan

225
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,899
right now our investors that came on

226
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,700
from the beginning came on for the

227
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:38,519
journey and actually and really

228
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,379
challenging Capital markets last year we

229
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:43,679
made the decision to go out and

230
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:46,799
diversify our shareholder base and so we

231
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,719
added 18 new investors into our

232
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,399
portfolio last year knowing that we're

233
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,639
going to keep on this journey for a bit

234
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,799
longer and that really is because we are

235
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:58,199
a medicines company and to build value

236
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:00,899
and IP in a medicines company does take

237
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,360
time we're a medicines company that

238
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:06,179
grows things from plants that also takes

239
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,820
time so really to give us time to build

240
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:10,739
that value for our shareholders who have

241
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,260
backed us all the way you know that's

242
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,180
why we look at a longer term plan uh

243
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:17,278
before we start talking about exits yeah

244
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:19,079
that makes perfect sense and and Luke we

245
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:20,519
were talking backstage about kind of

246
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,040
some of these things what are some

247
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,240
thoughts you have on exit uh because I

248
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:25,259
really like to please share with the

249
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,899
audience

250
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:30,179
well in general I think the overall

251
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:32,458
landscape has has changed dramatically

252
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:34,559
and while the early days of this

253
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:36,239
industry was built on dreams and you

254
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,119
know storylines and I would say press

255
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,039
releases and events where people scratch

256
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,759
their backs and kind of you know built

257
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,860
uh let's call the US dream uh or

258
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:48,659
Canadian whatever you want to call it

259
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:52,440
um in general Capital markets have dried

260
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:57,299
up there is a different kind of uh

261
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:59,580
uh appetite from investors and our

262
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:01,979
strategy went from two years ago well

263
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,240
let's you know just Europe Africa and

264
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,980
Asia is where we're focused on that's

265
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,399
where my Network's at that is where you

266
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,080
know we we we're very strong uh uh and

267
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,879
then sell to whoever makes the race in

268
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,720
the US once they go Federal blah blah

269
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:18,778
blah blah blah now we pivot it to a

270
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:23,040
quick focus on on break even we've been

271
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:24,838
self-funded so far we did see a need for

272
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,579
quick Capital as you said before when

273
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,019
Germany went model projects suddenly we

274
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,820
were the only software provider in the

275
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:32,580
world that actually has done this before

276
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,100
our reporting goes to the Swiss Health

277
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,440
Ministry to the UN so so we know what

278
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,360
they want and and then overnight we're

279
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,180
like okay oh [ __ ] this is now and we

280
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,800
need cash and it's been three months of

281
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:46,439
the most beautiful times of my life

282
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:48,479
great Foods great drinks amazing people

283
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,459
but I could have definitely done a lot

284
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,639
of more value for my company in that

285
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:57,479
time so pivot from you know sell the

286
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:59,039
dream to make it happen and once you

287
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,899
have that trajectory to making it happen

288
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:05,699
there's a lot to be done and really be

289
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:07,500
picked if you have the luxury pick and

290
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,540
choose who you bring on board ideally

291
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,480
somebody that can throw in cash again

292
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:15,480
and again when it's needed and fast and

293
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:19,259
stay close with whoever you get behind

294
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,139
you and in general it's it's a constant

295
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:24,838
shift with a lot of different

296
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:27,299
factors that determine an exit strategy

297
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,920
yeah and it's very important you know we

298
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:30,000
started talking about it with exit and

299
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:31,799
we're going to get into some other stuff

300
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,539
but uh one piece of advice I remember

301
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:35,099
someone asked me what's the number one

302
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:37,379
piece of advice and it's so hard to say

303
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,879
number one but really who you take money

304
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:41,100
from and I think all three of these

305
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,078
people here are talking about how

306
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,820
important the right exit and if you're

307
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:46,379
not in the right exit situation make

308
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,660
sure you're taking money from the right

309
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:50,700
situation but enough about exiting you

310
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:51,899
know let's talk about entering uh we're

311
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,459
going to talk about the entering the

312
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:55,620
market kicks and shovels and we're going

313
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,819
to open up to some questions now when

314
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,679
you're talking about entering the market

315
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,180
uh one thing that we were talking about

316
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:02,699
is how do we build value in the business

317
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:04,559
through brand reputation and IP so

318
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,300
before we're exiting let's talk about

319
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,439
entering and Carmen maybe you want to

320
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:09,000
kind of start us off with that and we

321
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,040
can just talk about you know how do you

322
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,799
build value in this business so we can

323
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:16,199
one day exit yeah so I think one of the

324
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:18,899
key things around building value in the

325
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,220
business is going out there and doing it

326
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,320
um you know you were mentioning Luke

327
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,240
about all the press releases and all of

328
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,940
the big Fanfare about things and we've

329
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,399
all seen that we've all seen a lot of

330
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,440
public publicity and big Fanfare around

331
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,360
the Cannabis industry

332
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,579
um for us I think it's really key to be

333
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,039
going out and delivering so getting

334
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:40,278
product to Market we always chose for us

335
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:43,139
to deliver for kiwi Patients First

336
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:46,439
delivering our home Market first we're

337
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:48,180
very careful on what we promise we want

338
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,459
to make sure that what we promise we do

339
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:52,679
deliver and sometimes those things are

340
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:54,778
outside of our control and so we you

341
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:55,559
have some very honest conversations with

342
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:57,419
our

343
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:59,578
Partners you know our distribution

344
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:02,278
partners with our patients with our

345
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:03,719
shareholders and I think that you know

346
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:06,299
rather than trying to sell the story

347
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,120
building the relationship is really

348
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:11,219
important in how you build value in the

349
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,360
business you know the other part really

350
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,980
around brand and IP are in a medicines

351
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,620
Market that does take time the next

352
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,500
steps for us are moving into a clinical

353
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,179
evidence base and clinical trials the

354
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,159
great thing about a medicinal cannabis

355
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:28,799
scheme is you can put products into

356
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:31,019
market and get feedback and that's

357
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:33,539
different from other medicines where you

358
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:36,179
come up with an idea you develop a

359
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:38,039
product and 10 years later once you've

360
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:39,838
done clinical trials and invested all

361
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:42,120
the money you can put it into market so

362
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,700
we're actually using that opportunity to

363
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,039
build value by learning about the

364
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,860
markets and learning about the clinical

365
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:51,480
results of our products in Market which

366
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:55,079
we can then feed back into our

367
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,759
Innovation and IP pipeline

368
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:59,219
sense

369
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,799
I think in

370
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,839
no just real quick in terms of entering

371
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,519
a market is also how how do you

372
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,560
differentiate yourself

373
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,600
and also I mentioned it's it's not our

374
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:11,278
first rodeo with counter rash as we

375
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,778
firmly looked at the supply chain and

376
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,120
asked so where is actually our core

377
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:17,159
Advantage it can't be cultivation

378
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,200
because there's so many excellent

379
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:20,939
Growers out there it's bad about

380
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,200
manufacturing or knowing the regulatory

381
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,399
framework in Europe

382
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,440
um that's why we came up with the model

383
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,139
let's partner with the best Growers out

384
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,519
there get their product to Germany and

385
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:31,500
then we take care of the rest which is

386
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,480
actually quite challenging because the

387
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,578
framework differs from Germany to Poland

388
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,100
to the UK but that's what we've been

389
00:14:35,578 --> 00:14:39,838
doing for the last six seven years we

390
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,278
didn't cultivate but we did the rest and

391
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,620
that's why we came up with the new model

392
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:46,320
which was very unique when we launched

393
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,360
it in 2021 and that's part of a success

394
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,459
story at the end of the day there needs

395
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,079
to be a differentiator

396
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:54,000
yeah so that's a good point and you're

397
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,620
investing in people and their experience

398
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,659
and their ability to differentiate

399
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,860
that's a really good point Luke that's

400
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:00,480
why you should never let somebody else

401
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,800
take a question when you actually had a

402
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,659
great answer for it but actually the

403
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:05,219
differentiating factor also goes for

404
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:06,778
investors

405
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,180
um what is your Niche what do you what's

406
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:11,039
your added value what can you bring to

407
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:13,379
the table for a company looking at

408
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,179
everybody right now no in the end of the

409
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,439
day it goes yes from from our side from

410
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:18,838
the industry and we have to find our

411
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,540
Niche we also have to then be agile

412
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:22,920
lovely word and kind of like pivot a

413
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:24,360
little bit I wanted to do Global Supply

414
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:26,159
Chain management and now I have a

415
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,000
software company

416
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:30,539
um

417
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,940
which works luckily for us but don't be

418
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:34,198
too agile kind of try to stick within a

419
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,899
bit of the boundaries of what you know

420
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:38,399
and I think the same goes for investors

421
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:39,958
uh it's not just here is a million or

422
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,339
ten or whatever by the way a million or

423
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:44,399
ten is a lot of money in Europe it's not

424
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:46,160
a lot of money in in the US but uh find

425
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,559
someone that can spend this sensefully

426
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,879
uh uh first and uh and really what is

427
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:52,138
your added value or can you bring them

428
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:53,879
can you bring them Network can you bring

429
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:55,320
them more Capital down the line can you

430
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:57,360
bring them advisory in which direction

431
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,879
and and this is something that I think

432
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,680
gets lost on both sides and then we're

433
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:03,600
here one inside yes we're taking the

434
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,939
side of of the industry here but but for

435
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,259
me what I'm looking for in an investor I

436
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,240
want him to tell me look I'll bring you

437
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:11,278
this this and this because just to get

438
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,639
cash yes of course cash is King and it's

439
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:17,698
very important but from the side from

440
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,100
our side is this USP as you call it goes

441
00:16:17,698 --> 00:16:21,778
both ways and and this is what I'm I've

442
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,220
been missing in the last three months of

443
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:24,720
talking to people it's like what do you

444
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,459
need more than money and I'm like yeah

445
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,320
absolutely it's called smart money and

446
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:29,939
and stick talking with with you Luke you

447
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,620
know we had a conversation recently and

448
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,600
and I know Luke doesn't take it the

449
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,679
wrong way we talk about the not sexy

450
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,600
part of this business you know everyone

451
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:38,458
wants to talk about all this genetics

452
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,620
and growing and the flower and all this

453
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:42,599
fun stuff but actually the important

454
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,940
part about investing is making sure that

455
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,339
the not sexy stuff is really taken care

456
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,800
of and Luke sorry to talk about software

457
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:52,199
is maybe not the sexiest thing but it's

458
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:53,758
so critical to all this and and you're

459
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:56,639
you're the first person if you can touch

460
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,740
on certification and how software helps

461
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,180
with it is so critical like we were

462
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,039
talking about backstage that you can't

463
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:04,019
even get insurance if you're not

464
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:05,938
compliant and the software which helps

465
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:08,759
you with it so you might not realize how

466
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:10,319
important something not so popular is

467
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:11,939
and you might not even know about but

468
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,438
it's critical and don't invest in

469
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:15,179
businesses that don't understand that so

470
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,640
maybe Luke if you can kind of start us

471
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:19,740
off with uh maybe not the sexiest topic

472
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,520
from such a sexy gentleman like yourself

473
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:25,019
but please go ahead thank you thank you

474
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:26,578
sexy is always relative

475
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:28,619
um in the end of the day it lays in the

476
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:31,139
eyes of no I'm just kidding

477
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:32,819
um look yes exactly because everybody

478
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,200
loves those you know everybody wants to

479
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:35,399
be the Superstar but in the end of the

480
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,840
day it's not the superstar that makes

481
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,640
the most money in the end of the day

482
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:40,459
maybe in sports it is more or less but

483
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,220
then in industries that are developing

484
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:46,200
if you uh let's go back to to the

485
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,720
non-sexy part that I found which is

486
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,279
which is compliance and transparency and

487
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,259
standards and Regulatory framework

488
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:55,440
harmonization and all those

489
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:57,599
lovely subjects in the back end

490
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,279
um what what if I do a little detour

491
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,139
there with the insurance thing that you

492
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,700
threw in it's really nice to get 20

493
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,559
million to make a facility and grow

494
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,819
cannabis without anybody buying it at

495
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:07,019
some point you have to sell it at some

496
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:08,460
point you have to ship it somewhere at

497
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:11,099
some point you want it to be shipped

498
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,380
with insurance because otherwise uh you

499
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:15,659
know something happens and by chance

500
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,539
cannabis is proud to things happening

501
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,700
that are not planned

502
00:18:17,538 --> 00:18:23,819
so you need to really you know factor in

503
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:26,038
everything and the amount of money that

504
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:28,678
or the amount of companies that I spoke

505
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:31,619
to on four continents in 18 countries

506
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:35,400
and so forth that have raised and I

507
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:37,439
almost said tons you know lots of money

508
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,298
um and then go like yeah but why should

509
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,679
I pay for compliance and like you do one

510
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:42,599
wrong batch and you lose your license

511
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,940
and everything is gone and you want to

512
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:46,678
really skimp out like that fraction of

513
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,080
your investment on that one important

514
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,059
part that if you do it right you go into

515
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:53,279
a bank with a de-risking kind of like

516
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:56,220
reporting and say look here give me you

517
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:58,500
know Finance bits and pieces of my of my

518
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:01,679
beard letter credits and you know in the

519
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,058
supply chain and so forth and uh or you

520
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,220
can just go and raise money again for

521
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:08,038
that but that's uh it's in everybody's

522
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,600
else's owns interest to be see what they

523
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:11,339
want to do and insurance in the end of

524
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:12,899
the day which industry do you have

525
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:15,359
shipments worth a couple of million

526
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:18,360
dollars depending on the volume and that

527
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:21,119
you ship from you said before Jamaica

528
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:22,500
Uganda uh let's throw Zimbabwe in there

529
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,899
and then go to insurance and say I want

530
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,940
to ship cannabis from these countries to

531
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,280
where we're at so it really helps if you

532
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,320
have a Swiss software with a Swiss

533
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,359
de-risking aspect that is accepted by

534
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:36,178
the Swiss Health Ministry for

535
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:38,699
recreational numbers adult use pilot

536
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:41,660
projects no but but really put put some

537
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:45,419
thought into it what can you bring into

538
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:49,380
your uh production flow whatever supply

539
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:51,600
chain and to really uh let it flow

540
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,780
afterwards and it's usually the unsexy

541
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,779
things

542
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:58,679
no very good point uh any other kind of

543
00:19:57,058 --> 00:20:00,000
picks and shovels or auxiliary

544
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:01,798
businesses that you want to just touch

545
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,779
on that you think maybe is not as

546
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:05,519
popular or you know people are excited

547
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:07,558
about but are still so critical to your

548
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,900
businesses uh you know anything that you

549
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:12,899
can think of yeah so I can add an

550
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:15,538
example there around banking so we

551
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,640
changed our bank last year to one that

552
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:20,339
was going to better suit our needs as we

553
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,200
go into the next phase of growth

554
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:24,538
um to work with our new bank the Bank of

555
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,580
New Zealand they had to change all of

556
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:28,919
their policies to be able to work with

557
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:31,259
medicinal cannabis but they chose to do

558
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,820
it because it is a new industry that

559
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:35,819
they really support and they have high

560
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:37,798
growth and and we work with them as a

561
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:41,700
really strong partner so they support us

562
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:43,980
with our uh FX hedging for example but

563
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,500
they also support us with capital

564
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,779
raising and introducing us to some of

565
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,579
their High net worth individuals they

566
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:53,099
support us with their connections which

567
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:54,899
then help with things like insurance and

568
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:57,538
so I think you know there's a lot of

569
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,759
things to set behind from a partnership

570
00:20:57,538 --> 00:21:01,558
model and when we talk Partnerships in

571
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,679
this industry we're often talking about

572
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:06,960
the physical Partnerships the movement

573
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:10,620
of goods and materials but the

574
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,120
Partnerships on the services side can

575
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:16,199
really

576
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:18,659
help move your business forward or make

577
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,400
your life really really hard as a CEO if

578
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,620
you have to spend a lot of time managing

579
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,538
that partnership it's something that

580
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:26,699
your customers don't see it's something

581
00:21:24,538 --> 00:21:28,200
that your investors don't see but

582
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,360
actually you can't run a business

583
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,600
without some of those service providers

584
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:36,899
whether it is software banking Insurance

585
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:39,480
Logistics all of those pieces have to

586
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,860
work to be able to deliver and I'm

587
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,140
really happy you actually touched on it

588
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:45,000
because we are want to talk about the

589
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,320
elephant in the room that you know this

590
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,880
morning I heard a lot of kind of

591
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,500
frustration around a lot of different

592
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,299
stuff but the elephant of the room is

593
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,038
the challenges of actually getting the

594
00:21:51,298 --> 00:21:54,359
money right now I mean it's we were

595
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,640
talking backstage about the importance

596
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:58,079
of being even Keel and profitable rather

597
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,120
than being at the mercy of investors

598
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:02,339
there's a lot of importance about being

599
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:04,259
Nimble and the ability to Pivot is so

600
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:06,658
critical in an Emerging Market while

601
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:07,798
we're pioneering this thing so uh the

602
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,900
question that we have is what are the

603
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:12,000
key Focus areas and challenging economic

604
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,559
conditions when capital is scarce what

605
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,720
you know it would be nice if we just

606
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:18,418
raised money like we did in the past but

607
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,798
what what can you all maybe suggest uh

608
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:21,720
until all the money's being thrown at

609
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:23,339
you how do you survive long enough until

610
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,220
you can make some money and potentially

611
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:28,619
exit you look eager to jump in on this

612
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,019
one yeah yeah we just I guess we're in

613
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:32,879
the in the end of the or tail end of the

614
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:34,440
first bus yeah the second one it's

615
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,200
called the bell curve then you have m a

616
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,940
uh which is all lovely lovely people

617
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,980
coming in telling you what you can't do

618
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,298
and and then they tell you you know

619
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,798
drive you into the ground and bring

620
00:22:42,298 --> 00:22:45,960
three companies together with for

621
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:48,119
getting uh the company cultures and then

622
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,179
m a blah blah so from an industry

623
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:53,459
standpoint uh in those moments

624
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:55,679
Partnerships go a long way and maybe try

625
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,298
to understand how can I add value there

626
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,919
how can I what am I really good at I

627
00:22:57,298 --> 00:23:00,418
don't have to do it all and this is a

628
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,600
big problem about the Cannabis industry

629
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:06,538
everybody wants to do it all and this

630
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:07,740
vertically integrated uh um you know

631
00:23:06,538 --> 00:23:10,019
model

632
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,419
worked wonders in New Zealand and and

633
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:14,279
worked wonders in in Canada and the U.S

634
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:16,980
but it's not really how the world works

635
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:19,200
so so really find your Niche what is

636
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,058
your actual USP are you you know do you

637
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,000
do clones best do you contract

638
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:27,058
manufacturing contract Farm whatever I

639
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,019
find strong alliances and capital is not

640
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:32,700
going to be uh flowing uh in bulk over

641
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:34,440
the next couple of years or at least

642
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,058
that's what every Economist out there

643
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,259
will tell you every investor will tell

644
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:39,899
you no no next year next year

645
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:41,400
everything's gonna be fine but there's a

646
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:44,100
strategy behind that

647
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,980
um so so really Partnerships is is my

648
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:49,139
answer there and maybe you know got the

649
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:52,019
ego bit back here and find long-term

650
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,880
alliances and survival mode is at the

651
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:55,500
moment what I think is key for for many

652
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,179
industry players survival mode that's

653
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,798
that's definitely good advice uh Carmen

654
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:00,360
and Philip is basically that's our

655
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:01,619
operating model so we believe in

656
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:04,019
Partnerships

657
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:05,519
um so our cultivators they are Partners

658
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:07,500
they're not suppliers

659
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,720
um so we basically work together to get

660
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:12,058
the best product available into any

661
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,640
medical market so that goes a long way

662
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:16,200
though so if something doesn't go

663
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,419
according to plan it's still it's still

664
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,220
a partnership we can work it out at the

665
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:22,140
end of the day uh if you talk about

666
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,779
Supply agreements supplies it's it's

667
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,340
difficult to if you're if you're in a

668
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:28,918
challenging situation

669
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:30,538
um and also um again so back in my

670
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:32,880
Aurora days we had to do it all

671
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:36,000
ourselves uh so nobody is an expert

672
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,460
along the the full supply chain focus on

673
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,839
what you do best provide a value-add for

674
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,279
your partners and then I think you're in

675
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:43,439
a pretty good position

676
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,538
um and at the end of the day everybody

677
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,759
wants to grow but try to be profitable

678
00:24:45,538 --> 00:24:49,679
as quickly as possible so because you're

679
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,839
not in at the mercy of investors and

680
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,120
then you're again in difficult situation

681
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,918
trying to raise money quick we never

682
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:58,500
wanted to be in that position so that's

683
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,480
why we're adamant on growing profitably

684
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,619
at the end of the day and uh and Carmen

685
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,360
it was awesome what you said about the

686
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:04,918
support from the bank and it was awesome

687
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:07,379
hearing your story of how the government

688
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:09,000
is supporting you I mean in Canada I can

689
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,340
tell you that the banks were very

690
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,900
difficult even were federally legal and

691
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:15,000
they give a hard time for cannabis

692
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,440
companies to come and uh when I was

693
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,058
executive director of our trade

694
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,798
Association we met with the banking

695
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:21,178
Association and they said the number one

696
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:22,619
concern from the banks is they don't

697
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:24,360
know who's legal and who's not and I

698
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:26,579
said oh really because here's a link to

699
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:28,379
a website that has a full list of who's

700
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:30,538
legal and they can send you a copy of

701
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,980
their license so you know we're not

702
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:33,058
buying that so but that's awesome that

703
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,099
you're getting the support of the bank

704
00:25:33,058 --> 00:25:36,960
is there any other kind of thoughts of

705
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:39,000
what people can do when the banks are

706
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,860
maybe not so supportive uh not everyone

707
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,419
is as lucky to to have the support like

708
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:43,379
in New Zealand but any kind of thoughts

709
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:45,720
on that and then we'll take questions

710
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:47,940
from the audience yeah so back to the

711
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,740
support from that we get from the

712
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,058
government so a big shout out to New

713
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,740
Zealand trade and Enterprise shout out

714
00:25:51,058 --> 00:25:55,798
to New Zealand are they back there Shout

715
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:57,538
Out New Zealand man over there where to

716
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:58,579
support your industry can we come and

717
00:25:57,538 --> 00:26:00,960
raise money

718
00:25:58,579 --> 00:26:03,599
so New Zealand trading Enterprise do

719
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,940
have an investment arm and Helios has

720
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,558
been certified under the active investor

721
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,080
program which is where I say you can get

722
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:12,599
a Visa if you come and invest in Helios

723
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:15,480
or in the other companies in in New

724
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:18,599
Zealand but I think our New Zealand Eco

725
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,579
structure around supporting the industry

726
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:23,759
we get a lot of support from the

727
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:26,038
government nzte is one of those Callahan

728
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:28,798
Innovation also support a lot of our

729
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:30,599
research and development Frameworks and

730
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:33,179
Helios has just been named in the top

731
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:35,519
100 high growth companies for Callahan

732
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:37,559
Innovation so that's supporting things

733
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,720
for us like our breeding and genetics

734
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:42,418
program it supports some of our

735
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,640
purification new technologies that are

736
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:48,299
coming online it also supports our

737
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,100
talent so we have three PhD students who

738
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:52,679
are developing products who are funded

739
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:54,480
mainly funded by the the government in

740
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:56,278
New Zealand and that means that it's

741
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,140
bringing our next wave of products but

742
00:26:56,278 --> 00:27:01,859
at the same time as bringing our next

743
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:04,500
wave of talent into the organization so

744
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:08,038
I do have to give a big shout out to the

745
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,659
ecosystem that we we live in Back to the

746
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:11,879
point around

747
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:14,460
you know what do you do in these really

748
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,860
challenging times then whether it's

749
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,419
support from Partners like government or

750
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:20,339
from your existing shareholders that's

751
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:23,100
really important but I would absolutely

752
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:25,678
agree get to break even as fast as you

753
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:27,240
can focus on what gets you there so that

754
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,778
you're self-funding and you can invest

755
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,700
then in the sexy and Fun Stuff yourself

756
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:35,099
and then you also get the rewards as you

757
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,600
get to being investing in that sexy and

758
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:38,939
fun stuff as well

759
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:40,500
I think it's a very very good point I'm

760
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,058
happy here in New Zealand is that

761
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,460
forward thinking actually Germany is

762
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:47,759
also I know two people in the room here

763
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:50,220
who got 20 percent uh grants for their

764
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,960
facilities uh r d is usually something

765
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,759
that is always also very much supported

766
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,900
you can get tax breaks but you've got to

767
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:56,278
go there and talk to them they don't

768
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:59,278
come to you and just throw it in your

769
00:27:56,278 --> 00:28:02,400
face so uh and there are a lot of

770
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:03,960
approach programs Switzerland is where

771
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,600
I'm from there's nice programs Europe

772
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,538
has Horizon 2020 so there's there's a

773
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:12,599
lot of different kind of approaches for

774
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:15,058
let's call it alternative financing

775
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:16,379
um and it's the government's job that

776
00:28:15,058 --> 00:28:18,359
when they have a business that is

777
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,460
functioning and giving jobs to make sure

778
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:22,740
that it kind of doesn't not go bust so

779
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,840
don't underestimate how much you can do

780
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,700
in that last stretch before you get

781
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:29,099
completely desperate but again you have

782
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,659
to do it in proactively find someone

783
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:32,639
that supports you either internally or

784
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:34,679
externally for them yeah and and really

785
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,080
important point is uh you know sometimes

786
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:39,120
you need the experts like Consulting is

787
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:40,379
to help you apply for these grants like

788
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:41,639
it's you know no they're not going to

789
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,140
knock on your door and say hey can we

790
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,400
give you some money sometimes you have

791
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,840
to call them but you have to know what

792
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,880
to say there's people who that's their

793
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,558
job is to know how to push those buttons

794
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,539
to get those type of Grants and they

795
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:52,859
work with all other Industries and you

796
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:54,179
know maybe they're not calling on you as

797
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:55,859
a cannabis company so you might have to

798
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:57,600
seek them out and I like something that

799
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:59,879
Carmen also said we here we're talking

800
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:01,980
more about investment and money but it's

801
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,778
also investing in people and education

802
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,700
and all these other Investments That

803
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:06,960
might not turn into money the way that

804
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,759
oh we're going to build a million square

805
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,200
foot facility it's going to cost 50

806
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:11,519
million dollars we're going to invest in

807
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,319
it but you know what if you take a

808
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,240
fraction of that invest in people invest

809
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:16,558
in research invest in things that you

810
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,359
know you're planting the seeds now for

811
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:19,859
an industry down the road you can really

812
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:21,298
reap those rewards so that's a really

813
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:23,219
good point and again shout out to New

814
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:25,619
Zealand for for realizing that and hope

815
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,058
more governments kind of realize uh that

816
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:29,158
these things take time and they're going

817
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:31,980
to reap the benefits if they actually do

818
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:34,260
some Investments now so excellent and uh

819
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,880
yeah opening up to questions uh from the

820
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:39,019
audience all right let's hear it from

821
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,020
the panel one more time

822
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,360
questions anyone ah okay why do you

823
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:50,460
always wait until I'm on this side of

824
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:52,740
the room don't be shy do it on purpose

825
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:56,298
you prepare one over there after please

826
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,298
they want to keep you exercised

827
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:06,839
often when private investors are

828
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:08,579
considering an entry into new into new

829
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:09,898
business or a growing business

830
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:12,599
the first question that they ask

831
00:30:09,898 --> 00:30:15,178
themselves at entry is how we're going

832
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:17,278
to exit right so in your experience uh

833
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:19,259
when you speak to private investors uh

834
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:21,599
what type of exit options are they

835
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:24,240
discussing and what type of exit options

836
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:26,879
are you seeing for yourselves and for

837
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,000
them is it trade sales trade sales to

838
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,980
home is it IPOs and then you know how do

839
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,259
you think in terms of you know how big

840
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:37,079
you need to grow

841
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:41,419
to be IPO ready within sort of some

842
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:41,418
foreseeable future timeline

843
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:49,380
it is uh rather than a question that

844
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:51,860
we get asked by our investors it's a

845
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:54,419
question we ask our potential investors

846
00:30:51,859 --> 00:30:56,519
what their goals are around the

847
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:58,679
investment so that we start off on that

848
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:00,119
same page and

849
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:01,860
um that really helps us to understand

850
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:04,199
what they're looking for in terms of

851
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:06,898
value in the business and those very

852
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,538
early conversations rather than getting

853
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:11,339
all the way down you know the courting

854
00:31:09,538 --> 00:31:13,980
process and then realizing that you have

855
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:16,439
different expectations around timing and

856
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:18,419
exits for us at Helios we've gone

857
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,940
through probably all of the different

858
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:22,740
options we haven't landed on which one

859
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,600
is the right one for us because I think

860
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:27,298
it'll depend on the conditions at the

861
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:28,939
time as to whether it could be a a trade

862
00:31:27,298 --> 00:31:31,740
sale or an IPO

863
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:33,298
so it really will depend on the value

864
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:36,538
that we build in the business over the

865
00:31:33,298 --> 00:31:39,119
next three to five years and also what

866
00:31:36,538 --> 00:31:41,940
the international market looks like New

867
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:44,099
Zealand is quite a small place so we

868
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:46,558
have five million people we have three

869
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:48,000
publicly listed cannabis companies in

870
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:49,980
New Zealand

871
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,419
um I think two of the three are here

872
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:55,140
you'll get to meet them over the next

873
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:57,120
few days and we are privately owned so

874
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,360
we see both those business models

875
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:01,918
playing out in the New Zealand market

876
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:04,678
and we'll see how that progresses and

877
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,538
what we can learn from that as we go

878
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:08,278
okay excellent point

879
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:10,619
another question for Carmen great

880
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:12,720
conversation so far by the way

881
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:13,859
um so Carmen I had the pleasure of

882
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,360
getting to connect with you before the

883
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:17,099
conference and one of the things that I

884
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:19,740
was really impressed with was your true

885
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:21,240
patient-centric approach and you told me

886
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,278
that the market is growing really

887
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,960
quickly in New Zealand because stigma is

888
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:27,298
dissolving more quickly than you

889
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,278
expected it to and I was wondering if

890
00:32:27,298 --> 00:32:31,200
you could talk a little bit about why

891
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,359
you think stigma is dissolving and

892
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,798
perception is changing and what you and

893
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,359
your other companies have done to help

894
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:39,298
support that work

895
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:41,699
yeah absolutely so my favorite thing

896
00:32:39,298 --> 00:32:44,278
about being CEO of a medicinal cannabis

897
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:46,380
company is the emails I get back from

898
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:49,500
patients so I've worked in medicines

899
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:51,778
most of my life but I've never actually

900
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,819
had those emails from patients to tell

901
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:55,440
me good news stories normally you just

902
00:32:53,819 --> 00:32:57,658
hear from patients when something has

903
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,720
gone wrong and I think that's a really

904
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:02,940
powerful thing that when patients are

905
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,819
able to access medicinal cannabis and

906
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:08,220
get life-changing experiences they

907
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:10,379
actually go and seek out they seek out

908
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:13,019
my email to tell me that and to say

909
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:15,179
thank you but they also tell their

910
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:18,000
friends whether it's over coffee or over

911
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:20,580
the back garden fence so a lot of our

912
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,159
demand in New Zealand is patient driven

913
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:25,439
in New Zealand any doctor can prescribe

914
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:29,220
medicinal cannabis for any condition and

915
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,620
that's for CBD and for THC and our

916
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:34,500
doctors are learning about medicinal

917
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:36,418
cannabis in some cases they're referring

918
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:39,240
people to specialist clinics which are

919
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:41,399
also growing but I think that the key

920
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,919
thing is the openness to learn and

921
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:45,418
myself plus the other medicinal cannabis

922
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,000
companies that are here from New Zealand

923
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:50,519
we've all just come from a GP conference

924
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,898
there's two each year and we all have a

925
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:54,058
presence there

926
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:56,339
this year there was a two-hour plenary

927
00:33:54,058 --> 00:33:58,798
session at that GP conference around

928
00:33:56,339 --> 00:34:01,199
education around medicinal cannabis so

929
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:03,839
those environments and being there and

930
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,640
working with doctors learning from

931
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:07,678
doctors what other tools they want in

932
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,320
their toolkit what other dosage forms

933
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,599
they want to be able to deliver for

934
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,059
their patients is a very very big part

935
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:18,899
of our ethos and being able to deliver

936
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:22,619
for our patients just in terms of how

937
00:34:18,898 --> 00:34:25,440
quickly things are growing in 2022 there

938
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:27,419
was 60 000 patients in New Zealand that

939
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,940
doubled from the previous year where we

940
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:31,618
had thirty thousand and we thought it

941
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:35,099
was going to double again this year in

942
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:37,320
2023 but it's growing way faster than we

943
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:38,820
thought and so I think that that's a

944
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,159
really exciting thing

945
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,000
for companies that are setting up in New

946
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,579
Zealand

947
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,159
if I go back two years I thought the

948
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:48,779
only way that Helios or other medicinal

949
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:51,780
cannabis companies in New Zealand could

950
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:53,820
survive was all about exports our New

951
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:56,639
Zealand Market has grown quickly and

952
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:58,580
that's really supporting us to be able

953
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,019
to get to the point where we can export

954
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:02,639
and being able to deliver in our local

955
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:04,440
market is really helping the

956
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,179
relationships we have with our export

957
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,858
and distribution partners because they

958
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:09,960
know that we're able to consistently

959
00:35:07,858 --> 00:35:12,659
deliver so there's lots of great things

960
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,400
around this story for our patients that

961
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:16,078
we're delivering for but also for our

962
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,519
shareholders and it sounds like you

963
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,099
almost have as many patients as Canada

964
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:21,480
you're going to Awards and actually very

965
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:23,220
important point and I've mentioned this

966
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,099
to some of the people in the room have a

967
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:27,899
domestic Market first I'm so tired of

968
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:30,180
all these industries that oh we're going

969
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,920
to grow but only for you guys we don't

970
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:33,899
want it for our people I think it's so

971
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,599
important to have cannabis for your

972
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:38,160
people and then worry about export and

973
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:39,420
not make the mistake of like Denmark or

974
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:41,039
others but yeah you have another thing

975
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,900
if you're lucky and you do have a

976
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:45,719
domestic market so talking about our

977
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,519
partners in Uganda for example there is

978
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:49,919
no local and domestic Market still they

979
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,179
grow very good cannabis and you should

980
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,500
partner with us you can bring it into

981
00:35:51,179 --> 00:35:54,299
Europe and start building your business

982
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:57,119
and waiting for the domestic Market to

983
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,500
actually open up so they're excellent

984
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,059
grows out there but they don't have a

985
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,400
domestic market then they need to

986
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:04,259
venture out and go International but

987
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,180
