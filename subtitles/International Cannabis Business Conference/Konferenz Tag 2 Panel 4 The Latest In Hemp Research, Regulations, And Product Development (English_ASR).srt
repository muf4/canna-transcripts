so welcome on this panel on the latest

2
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:14,339
in ham research regulations and product

development

4
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:18,740

so um let's just jump straight in maybe

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,980
start with you Patrick you have

17
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:51,899
extensive experience in advocating for

18
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:53,759
the hemp industry in particular can you

19
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,679
share some insights on the challenges

20
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,079
faced by the industry in navigating the

21
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,859
patchwork of regulations that apply an

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,239
industrial hemp and how the

23
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:05,760
nihc is working to address these

24
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:08,640
challenges yeah absolutely and I think

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,600
Eric set the stage you know perfectly

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,340
for this discussion and one is the plan

27
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:17,759
uh the national Industrial Hemp Council

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,520
was founded in March of 2019. we have a

29
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,939
10-year plan we've been executing that

30
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:26,519
and have hit our benchmarks in spite of

31
00:01:22,938 --> 00:01:29,099
covet in spite of the downturn because

32
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:31,019
we're very focused on two things one is

33
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:33,658
consumer safety so if you come to our

34
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:36,618
booth and meet Lakshmi Mahan we're

35
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,299
working on the niac plus verify program

36
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:41,819
for product for testing and third-party

37
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,979
certification and that's the first half

38
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,258
of what Nic does is consumer safety

39
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:48,478
making sure the consumer is safe I used

40
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,579
to work for the American chemistry

41
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,099
Council and my clients were Dao Dupont

42
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:56,158
PPG

43
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:59,339
Etc and oxychemical and that was during

44
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,859
the time of BPA Biz final a and that's

45
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,920
where the consumer lost confidence and a

46
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:08,098
perfectly good chemical that was used to

47
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,759
make shatterproof bottles water bottles

48
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,738
Etc

49
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,598
so that's the first of what Nic does and

50
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:16,219
that's what the Nic verify program is

51
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:19,560
the second part is regulatory certainty

52
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:21,959
and working with the government so we

53
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,560
did that so the reason I'm here is the

54
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,598
US Department of Agriculture uh funds us

55
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,580
for the market Access program so we are

56
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,459
the only uh

57
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,620
us Association that receives Federal

58
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,080
funding and that's because the

59
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,580
government picks one entity and we

60
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,560
support others so Global hemp

61
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,840
Association and hemp industry

62
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,360
Association we have mousse with them yes

63
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,560
you know we're in the same space but

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,560
we're very different but the government

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,120
has said to us saying you are the ones

66
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,620
that we want to work with but we bring

67
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,000
them along too so we're the single

68
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,459
funding source

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,378
you know I know my other panelists but

70
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,640
you know just really quickly so what

71
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,899
does that mean

72
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:02,518
um so we get Market Access program

73
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,099
funding that was a first that was being

74
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:08,280
able to use federal funds to promote him

75
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:10,018
not cannabis but him so we're very we're

76
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,719
very targeted and that's why this

77
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:14,580
discussion is hemp and nothing else

78
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,840
so that took two years to do we went

79
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,000
through the office of general counsel to

80
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,378
the USDA explain to them the difference

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,300
you would think you know lawyers would

82
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:24,179
know but you know these are a lot of

83
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,640
nuances so we achieved that we receive

84
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,540
roughly a quarter of a million dollars

85
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,479
there

86
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:32,340
next step is uh getting all the

87
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,859
technical assistance especially crops so

88
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,360
we have four grants through the usdn we

89
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,400
can talk to folks later about those and

90
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,360
those are uh

91
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,860
life cycle analysis of

92
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,379
fiber is one one is a regulatory

93
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,120
analysis of the European market and what

94
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:50,878
are the hurdles and you know for getting

95
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:54,180
U.S companies into the us but it's also

96
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:56,399
I serve on a committee appointed by the

97
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,739
secretary of agriculture and the U.S

98
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,239
trade representative

99
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:03,120
Ambassador Tai and under and secretary

100
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,640
vilsack appointed by both of those

101
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,000
agencies and I serve on the tobacco

102
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:11,518
cotton peanut and now historically and

103
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,280
Monumental is now him so as a federal

104
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,399
agency two of them the U.S trade

105
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,639
representative's office and the USDA and

106
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:23,399
is now the for our efforts it's tobacco

107
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:27,000
cotton peanuts and hemp committee we

108
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:28,679
also serve on the on the um the products

109
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,019
committee on tasks also when we're also

110
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,360
trying to get another one so yeah

111
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:35,219
there's ups and downs but the bottom

112
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,560
line is and in government you know the

113
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,940
FDA we all know that but you know

114
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,100
government is changing and moving

115
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:43,560
forward and funding and actually funding

116
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,660
uh hemp you know with that all stop is

117
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,160
we're very limited on time but I want to

118
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,139
focus on the positive that you know

119
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,639
things are happening and it is it's a

120
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,620
long term you know as Eric said it's a

121
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,418
10-year plan it's not a three months six

122
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,060
months and that's what we're doing very

123
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:58,740
slow and steady and moving forward and

124
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,379
moving him forward

125
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,019
and also with the farm bill that just

126
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:05,699
changed can you maybe explain a little

127
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:07,500
bit more about that to the audience how

128
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:10,259
this affected like this regulation

129
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,660
affected everything yeah framework yeah

130
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:15,660
absolutely thank you and um it's the

131
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,100
2018 Farm Bill legalized him that was

132
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,720
Senator Mish McConnell who was the

133
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,340
majority leader at the time from

134
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,320
Kentucky

135
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:24,299
um you know another Association us hemp

136
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,339
Roundtable was you know had a very close

137
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,079
relationship with him and we've been

138
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:30,239
pushing it I was on Capitol Hill I used

139
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,698
to work for a senator in the in the late

140
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,560
1990s and I would see this legislation

141
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,538
come through it was from North Dakota

142
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,519
our farmers and I think this is

143
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:41,038
perfectly good but you know again as

144
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:44,219
people know to the evil we the you know

145
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:46,319
the the the bad you know MJ you know

146
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,979
Mary Jane and those type of things but

147
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,418
they saw the positives of him uh and

148
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:53,219
that's where I think it will end up at

149
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:55,198
the end of the day and my colleagues on

150
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,180
the panel we'll talk about that you know

151
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,639
it's an F1 racing it's you know

152
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,220
Automotive was mentioned at 20 in BMW

153
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,519
and it's because why

154
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:08,100
bottom line is money right it's cheap

155
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,758
it's cheaper than carbon fiber uh

156
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,919
lighter weight better fuel efficiency

157
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,600
so I think the long term yes hemp is

158
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,099
here to stay it's been here for

159
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,560
thousands of years and only in the

160
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,439
United States has been a short time of

161
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,819
about 40 years and I'll just put this in

162
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:27,060
really quickly since this is a business

163
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:31,160
to business so the opportunity that we

164
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:35,819
see is in Asia with Thailand opening up

165
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:37,500
uh their Marketplace to legalize hemp

166
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:38,400
marijuana cannabis I think they did it

167
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,199
right

168
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,758
and you'll see

169
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,580
you know the opportunities you can't

170
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,160
import hemp you can't you know

171
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:48,300
that's different but it's the IP so

172
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:53,280
that's where we're involved the National

173
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:56,759
Council we funded the 2022 Asian hemp

174
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:58,500
Expo there's a 2023 Asian hemp Expo if

175
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,500
you want to see excitement that's where

176
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,079
you need to go Japan Japan is changing

177
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,939
its laws on him right now there's really

178
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,918
only one farmer who can grow it and it's

179
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:09,478
used for ceremonial use for the

180
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,519
emperor's clothing but we've been in

181
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:14,099
contact with the U.S embassy but with

182
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,538
the Japanese government and you're going

183
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,520
to see that changing that goes to

184
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:19,680
discussion of the 0.2.3 percent of those

185
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,299
questions they were asking but we've

186
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,360
partnered with for those who are

187
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,098
interested in funding awr Lloyd they're

188
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,000
about the size of the Canadians about a

189
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:33,180
McKinsey or Bane but bringing companies

190
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,978
into Asia so this is B2B so we're going

191
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,699
to have that conversation there you know

192
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:40,379
PE private equity and but also just

193
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:43,560
the regulatory getting into those

194
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:45,060
countries so I want to be positive and I

195
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,860
want to provide people that opportunity

196
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,598
so I hope that answered your question

197
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,060
but the farm bill is happening so it

198
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:52,139
legalizes in 2018

199
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,699
to the answer the question hopefully

200
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:56,280
it's one percent that what we're pushing

201
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:58,500
for 31 organizations were getting

202
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:00,179
together in the United States first time

203
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,478
that's ever happened and it's just

204
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,939
working together works is our slogan and

205
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:08,219
when we do work together things happen

206
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:10,259
that's very true

207
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,360
um David having advice cannabis

208
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:14,580
companies for several years what are

209
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,759
some of the key regulatory challenges

210
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:19,378
that you see um that the companies are

211
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,960
facing in terms of research and product

212
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:24,840
development maybe particular with regard

213
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:29,519
to hemp or as you call it THC minus

214
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:32,519
cannabis yeah uh thanks uh Lisa

215
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:35,519
um yeah so when we're saying cannabis uh

216
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:37,199
as Lisa said if you saw me put we are a

217
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:41,038
global investor Forum we put together

218
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,959
cannabis as a Genus so we consider you

219
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,000
know marijuana people don't like that

220
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:48,239
term so we're calling it THC plus THC

221
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,179
minus but frankly the regulatory hurdles

222
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,860
are a problem a couple of things one the

223
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:55,319
The Regulators frankly don't know what

224
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,300
they're doing uh and I can speak for

225
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,320
that because

226
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:00,240
um

227
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,399
for example you know we had the interim

228
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,799
final rule which in itself speaks to

229
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,299
kind of the what government is about and

230
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,179
I can kind of say that because both my

231
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:11,579
parents were politicians but uh as far

232
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:14,939
as one one thing you can say is like for

233
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,278
example the FDA well maybe let me step

234
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,740
back and talk about the uh to the farm

235
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:22,139
bill that went through

236
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,299
before I get to talking about the

237
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:26,819
authorities one of the problems is the

238
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:29,639
fact that not everybody gets the memo

239
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,700
right so for example we had the 2018

240
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:36,439
farm bill passed in December 2018 right

241
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:39,180
so I had a hemp client based in Colorado

242
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,279
uh that ordered a shipment from Kentucky

243
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:44,338
and if you're from the state you might

244
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:46,919
remember this December 20 uh January

245
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,660
2019 it's going through Oklahoma the

246
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,860
truck runs the stop light and the cops

247
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:50,939
pull it over and they look in the back

248
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,360
and they think it's the biggest drug

249
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:57,540
bust in history right and so it turns

250
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,240
out uh the truck drivers got thrown in

251
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:02,039
jail then they end up testing so it

252
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,459
gives you an idea of the arbitrariness

253
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:07,199
of all this stuff they go ahead and test

254
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:09,719
uh the truckload and probably I think

255
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,278
half of it wasn't hot right because it's

256
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,160
supposed to be him but then they test

257
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,838
you know certain buds or parts of it and

258
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,778
it's hot because it's over 0.3 percent

259
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,120
so they consider it hot it turns out our

260
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:22,620
client didn't get that truckload for

261
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,100
another 18 months and they ended up

262
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,360
suing the state of Oklahoma but the

263
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,700
other thing as far as the regulatory

264
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,440
authorities go it is just it's it's

265
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,060
tough because if you know the

266
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,160
therapeutic Goods Administration in

267
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:37,199
Australia they recently had a

268
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:40,019
proclamation in late 2020 that said okay

269
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,120
we're done with you know this mess with

270
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:43,799
CBD and medicinal cannabis down under so

271
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,360
what we're going to allow is you can

272
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:50,819
produce a drug with 150 milligram CBD or

273
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,800
less and as most people know that

274
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,800
usually is probably not going to deliver

275
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,419
the effect so that they allow this but

276
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:58,500
then they kind of pull it back and if

277
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:00,000
you talk to a lot of the leading

278
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,399
scientists like Hunter land he thinks

279
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,440
it's just totally arbitrary and then you

280
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,000
have the fda's recent Proclamation that

281
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,220
came out and essentially said as

282
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,320
everybody knows CBD in the U.S has ruled

283
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,579
as a drug because of the epidiolex

284
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,760
President right

285
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:16,859
so now CBD is a drug it can't be used in

286
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:20,100
anything else now that the FDA has

287
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,480
recently come out said okay well if you

288
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,399
have a product and wellness and

289
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,959
everything else it can't be used if it's

290
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,539
CBD it has to run through a clinical

291
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:30,119
process unless it's a vape product so if

292
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:32,278
you have a vape product with CBD they're

293
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,220
not going to try to shut that down or if

294
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:37,500
you can get CBD from a dispensary so

295
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,480
again that the regulatory hurdles tend

296
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,339
to be pretty substantial because they

297
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,720
tend to be arbitrary

298
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:44,760
thank you

299
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,160
um but that's a good Bridge also uh to

300
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:48,720
you positive what progress have you

301
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:50,879
witnessed in terms of acceptance and

302
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,220
understanding of cannabis and also might

303
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,200
be hemp as a legitimate medical options

304
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,420
and are there any particular challenges

305
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,820
that still need to be addressed in order

306
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:02,939
to further Advance the use of cannabis

307
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:08,640
or hemp for medicinal purposes

308
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:11,880
yes uh as my colleague said on this

309
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:15,120
field is complete confusion inside the

310
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:16,399
EU that even we don't mention the world

311
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,700
you know

312
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:23,399
uh so it's uh it's really very hard to

313
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:29,640
deal nationally and internationally

314
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:32,700
uh I think the key is the education of

315
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:36,720
general public and professionals because

316
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:41,040
they only can push uh you know we tried

317
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:43,860
many years now like activists but if

318
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:46,679
doesn't come the impulse from the

319
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:49,620
you know doctors and nurses I don't

320
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:54,179
think it will change very soon but the

321
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:56,879
problem is that before they start to

322
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:58,979
uh treat cannabis that it should be it

323
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:01,200
will be another 10 years at least

324
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:05,100
because cannabis is not in curriculum

325
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,620
not in the medical schools not a bit now

326
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,920
in the faculty of Pharmacy in Slovenia

327
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,360
but still uh I think only through

328
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:16,278
education

329
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,360
and the problem with cannabis is mostly

330
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:21,179
bureaucratic obstacles and

331
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,919
over-regulation before it even comes to

332
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:25,199
the market

333
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:25,799
it's very true

334
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,459
um

335
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:31,199
and uh I mean you you are a part of you

336
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:33,179
have a you have a human rights rights

337
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,740
organization fist but you're also a

338
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:39,838
member of iacm so

339
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:42,180
do you see any other aspects other than

340
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,100
education like access programs for

341
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:46,620
example for patients even maybe for

342
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,480
hemp-based medicine I think it's like we

343
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,000
we have this big part where a lot of

344
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,399
people are using CBD lifestyle products

345
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,179
as medicines potentially yeah is there

346
00:13:53,399 --> 00:14:02,519
also a gap in your opinion uh so the Gap

347
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:04,578
is now that uh people get more and more

348
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:08,519
informed about it

349
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:11,278
but I think that the Cannabis as a plant

350
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:14,339
as genus should be allowed also with all

351
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:16,320
other compounds because uh I think just

352
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:19,560
talking about the CBD and health it's

353
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,620
about a little a little bit hypocritic

354
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:24,379
you know because we all know how the

355
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:28,500
endocannabinetic system works

356
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:32,338
but again I in this rigid situation

357
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:35,820
especially in inside the EU I don't see

358
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:38,940
very bright future you know you see what

359
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:41,399
is happening Portugal in France all over

360
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:46,139
the Europe so let's see what will happen

361
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:48,480
yeah it gets more complicated every day

362
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:50,459
um so uh Patrick let's jump back to you

363
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,039
what are some impacts of the current

364
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:55,319
regulations and how are they impacting

365
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,899
for example cultivation processing the

366
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,760
sale of hemp products and how can the

367
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:02,698
industry adapt to these varying limits

368
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:05,278
of THC globally and ensure compliance

369
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:07,019
while maximizing the potential of

370
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:09,778
hemp-based products

371
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:12,659
yeah absolutely

372
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:15,419
um locally you know it's a mess to be

373
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:19,019
perfectly honest with you for example to

374
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:22,439
do research in New York you need to pay

375
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:24,120
for your crop to be tested 300 you need

376
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,779
to be fingerprinted this is for the

377
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:31,459
farmer so for Cornell University uh Ivy

378
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:34,338
League school top agricultural

379
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:37,018
higher education in in the country

380
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:40,440
they're having a difficult time you know

381
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:42,480
getting product you know through to be

382
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,339
tested or to be you know worked on for

383
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,600
their research

384
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:48,600
um you know that's just one example

385
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,420
there's just a patchwork you know as

386
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,399
we've talked about regulations and rules

387
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:55,078
and laws and they're ever changing and

388
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:56,578
you know even Interstate we've talked

389
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:59,219
about the trucking Interstate

390
00:15:56,578 --> 00:16:02,059
Transportation that's not even getting

391
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,839
into the pesticide herbicide use

392
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:05,638
requirements by the Environmental

393
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,560
Protection Agency because you can use it

394
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:10,440
on one crop doesn't mean you can use it

395
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:12,559
on another you know every state has a

396
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,000
different Rule and then overall

397
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:17,159
federally you know if it's hot it's

398
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,019
illegal it's a class one drug and you

399
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:21,958
know there's a the social impact to that

400
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:24,720
and as we mentioned before why is

401
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:26,399
marijuana a cannabis a class one drug

402
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,139
and you know because you can easily

403
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,419
arrest people of a certain demographic

404
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:32,039
and put them in jail you know that's you

405
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:35,939
know that's that part so

406
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:38,159
it's very very difficult that being said

407
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,199
you know what is an answer

408
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,419
um universities are looking at countries

409
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:44,458
like Thailand right because you can go

410
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:47,338
there you can do the research

411
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:49,919
inexpensive for Labor uh you don't have

412
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:53,100
to worry about having a hot crop so

413
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:55,439
they're finding ways to I don't want to

414
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,120
say get around but to be able to do

415
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,360
their research

416
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,519
um and I keep pointing to Asia because

417
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,279
it's very very different and when I was

418
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:08,160
there last year in Bangkok you know the

419
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,599
comment was you know the marijuana and

420
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,419
this and we all know those strict

421
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:15,058
regulations of being caned or even

422
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:17,280
executed for drug trafficking

423
00:17:15,058 --> 00:17:21,000
um but they said but that's a U.S that

424
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:23,699
was U.S based on the 1940s 1950s at the

425
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,919
United Nation and you know we went along

426
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:28,460
because that's what the US wanted and

427
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,320
now they're saying but you know what

428
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:33,360
we use cannabis we've used it for

429
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:36,659
thousands of years I mean even when it

430
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:39,298
was illegal so to speak you know Farmers

431
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,400
on the countryside were using it they

432
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:43,139
don't have the issue of

433
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,140
cross-pollination contamination because

434
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:48,000
medical you know because marijuana is

435
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,740
used in what is grown in one part of the

436
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,900
country because of the climate and the

437
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,900
altitude and hemp has grown in another

438
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:57,120
and they look totally different

439
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,679
so you know in the U.S yeah it's it's

440
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,178
it's a mess and hopefully it gets

441
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:02,700
straightened out in the farm bill some

442
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:05,759
you know where and 30 you know one other

443
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,860
or 32 other 31 other organizations are

444
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,000
pushing for one percent

445
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:12,599
um you know and hopefully some other

446
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,179
things happen along those lines so I

447
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:16,859
think the opportunities are amazing you

448
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:18,298
know they're out there and just going to

449
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:22,199
the right place at the right time and

450
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:24,359
they'll find a way and you know it's you

451
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,940
know it's a finance driven

452
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,439
um uh proposal and that's and I do think

453
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,419
Asia is where you're going to see a lot

454
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,980
of this happening

455
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:33,360
um you know we look around and say well

456
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,400
you know the Market's up and down but if

457
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,139
you look at from where it was legal and

458
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,900
you take out the highs and lows right

459
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:42,120
overall

460
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,460
um it's an upward climb it's not steep

461
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:46,139
but it's very slow and steady and that's

462
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,700
where I think you know we need to be as

463
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,679
you need to be slow and steady and think

464
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,538
about it and build just as our

465
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,820
organization has been slow and steady in

466
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:55,859
building and we have a very good

467
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:58,319
reputation that you know and I don't say

468
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:59,939
that just because I'm here saying it by

469
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:01,740
the proof is you know in the taste of

470
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,360
the is in the taste of the pudding is

471
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,339
that you know we do get government

472
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:07,139
grants you know we are on government

473
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:08,639
committees

474
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,320
um and we're you know they we are

475
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,240
getting Government funding

476
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:13,918
so you know long answer to your short

477
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,558
question it's a hot mess in the United

478
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,720
States as everybody's been saying but

479
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:21,418
there's opportunity and it's being at

480
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,400
the right place at the right time and I

481
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:26,880
think Asia is that

482
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:29,340
thank you um so uh David you have your

483
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,260
background uh in biotech and you have

484
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:33,240
been working uh in with in this

485
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:36,538
background for quite some like in the in

486
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,460
the past where do you see an overlap or

487
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:41,220
an interest also from conventional

488
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:44,220
industry in the commodity hemp

489
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,600
well yeah thank you Lisa the the one

490
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:49,019
thing that's really kind of funny about

491
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:52,740
this actually is this panel actually

492
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:54,900
should be one of the most interesting uh

493
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:58,140
well-attended panels and the reason why

494
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:00,660
I say that is if you look at cannabis

495
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,640
again right you define it as essentially

496
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:06,000
well everybody knows the typical

497
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,820
cannabis plant has what 106 500

498
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,380
compounds 150 cannabinoids and they have

499
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:12,000
the flavonoids the terpenes all these

500
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,280
different and these molecules are

501
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,538
amazing right so we have all these these

502
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,980
molecules that we've really not

503
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:19,140
understood what they do and then you

504
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,298
have on the other side it's a it's a

505
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,700
it's a three-prong wheel right you have

506
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:26,038
all the molecules here you have all the

507
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,140
indications potential indications it

508
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:29,519
could be used and then you have the

509
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,559
human genetic side right because

510
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,179
everybody

511
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,859
uh has metabolized a lot of these

512
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:36,720
molecules differently because I know

513
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,699
that I used to work at a company called

514
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,819
affumetrix they're one of the first

515
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,620
companies to coin the term pharmacogen

516
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:45,659
and the reason why I say that this

517
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:47,879
should be the most interesting panel is

518
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:51,058
let's take out one of those molecules

519
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:54,059
which is Delta 9 THC right and that's

520
00:20:51,058 --> 00:20:56,519
what that molecule determines a lot of

521
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:59,460
these regulations right and so you take

522
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:03,418
that molecule out then you have CBC CBG

523
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,679
CBN uh you know we could go on for a

524
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:07,440
long time right and then a lot of these

525
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:10,140
chirpings and so if you really look at

526
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,679
the potential of this plant and you take

527
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:16,200
out THC this this whole experiment to us

528
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,780
it's the Holy Grail the Holy Grail is to

529
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,880
find out which of these molecules or by

530
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:23,160
themselves are in combination are

531
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,440
effective for treating an indicate give

532
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,880
an indication like for example one of

533
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,080
our clients is a public company in

534
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,120
Australia they're trying to run a

535
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,918
pivotal trial with CBD and insomnia

536
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:34,859
right that's kind of low-hanging fruit

537
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:38,640
but then you have CBC I've taken CBC

538
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:40,379
Canada chromine recently so it's it's

539
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,360
kind of interesting that yeah if you

540
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,100
talk about the science side there a lot

541
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:46,918
of signs to be applied and hopefully

542
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:48,899
next year this is more of an you know

543
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,000
well-attended panel because I think to

544
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,740
me that's where the future of this is

545
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,798
going to go is it's not just going to be

546
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:58,740
dependent on THC Delta 9 that is now

547
00:21:55,798 --> 00:22:02,220
Delta 8 might be a different story

548
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:04,440
so let's get back to you

549
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,480
um what is there any research that has

550
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,940
caught your attention recently uh where

551
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,500
would you say uh any specific areas in

552
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,080
research that you believe a great

553
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:16,859
promise for the future

554
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:20,220
uh yeah cannabis is the most research

555
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:22,319
plan on the planet you know like 150 000

556
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:26,819
studies in last 40 years

557
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:32,038
uh uh actually not but I hope there will

558
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:36,538
be very soon that uh somebody or

559
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:39,558
something could work on the

560
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:43,279
uh you know how to

561
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:47,038
modulate uh human endocannabinoid system

562
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:50,599
with cannabis I think this is the key

563
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:55,019
and this should be the key research so

564
00:22:50,599 --> 00:23:00,199
we don't develop the special cannabinet

565
00:22:55,019 --> 00:23:04,200
for each disease but how the best uh

566
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:06,058
uh modulate the endocannabinoid system I

567
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,100
think this should be the key because we

568
00:23:06,058 --> 00:23:11,879
all know now how the endocannabinoid

569
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:15,599
system works and I hope we will have a

570
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:18,059
methods in a near future to measure the

571
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:20,038
levels and the activities in the human

572
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:21,960
body

573
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:23,519
um how do you think are these confused

574
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,220
regulations that we have been talking

575
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:29,400
before are they impacting us as the

576
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,798
industry also yes of course uh

577
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,798
especially you know uh we are running a

578
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:37,440
lab in Ljubljana and we have to follow

579
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:39,839
all the regulations as for drug

580
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,558
trafficking even if we buy I don't know

581
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:46,740
one gram of standard THC standard you

582
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:49,440
have to fulfill uh the all regulations

583
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:52,500
like you will you know be drug

584
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,019
trafficker and this is very hard than

585
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,359
then another one is exchange of the

586
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:59,460
samples between the Laboratories you

587
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,558
know it's very hard because if you

588
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,900
cannot send Delta line you can but it's

589
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:06,119
a lot of paperwork so there are many

590
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,220
obstacles on the way yes

591
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:10,379
but if I could add one thing to that

592
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,900
real quick that we're talking about

593
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:15,600
research regulations one of the big

594
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,580
problems has been the stigma right so

595
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:20,480
for example let's take a good example

596
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:23,579
with biotech right so Watson and Crick

597
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,599
elucidate the structure with a lot of

598
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:30,058
help from Rosalind Franklin right 1953

599
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:32,519
1973 Conan Boyer developer accommodate

600
00:24:30,058 --> 00:24:34,379
DNA technology which really spawns a

601
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:36,298
whole industry right which then spawns

602
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,460
genotech which goes public in five years

603
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:41,339
later in 78 and then a couple years

604
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:44,340
later we have human recombinant insulin

605
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:46,558
so getting back to professors earlier

606
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:49,619
comment let's look at the fact that you

607
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:54,480
have Rafi mashulum uh God Rest his soul

608
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:56,639
what a star finds Delta 9 in the mid 60s

609
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,460
I think it's 64-65.

610
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,020
and then we don't find and determine

611
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,538
that we have an endocannabinoid system

612
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:06,119
until 93 or 92 right

613
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:08,279
and then that is how long ago you know

614
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:10,619
we had you know we had a Marinol was

615
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:12,720
really not a you know it's a it's an

616
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:14,399
analog on the on the market which really

617
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,339
hasn't done a whole lot so the the

618
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,538
potential of this industry is I think

619
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:21,119
really been held back not only

620
00:25:18,538 --> 00:25:23,759
regulations but stigma and the potential

621
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,379
if we can unlock that and unwrap that

622
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:27,599
you know it's going to be really

623
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,940
exciting next 10 years

624
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,918
thank you maybe I just want to add

625
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,558
something when they discovered or

626
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,900
isolated insulin it was one year from

627
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:39,298
isolation to the medical use

628
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,278
and we know about the endocannabinoid

629
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:43,980
system for 30 years

630
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:46,259
and nothing happens really

631
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:48,058
there are interests of the Earth

632
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:49,440
a lot more things could happen maybe

633
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:51,658
like this

634
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,580
but I really like your question though

635
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:55,440
like what what the technology is out

636
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:57,960
there and why is it different I mean we

637
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,640
have a video that shows rope and those

638
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,038
type of things and sales it's like well

639
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,360
even if you've replaced everything with

640
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:05,759
him but still really wouldn't make a

641
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,500
damp right but the technology is

642
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,359
different now right looking at it the

643
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,019
most recent that came out a few weeks

644
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:14,759
ago was being used in road construction

645
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:17,460
because of the high tensile strength of

646
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:18,839
of hemp fiber and if you think wow you

647
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,720
know we're not going to make roads out

648
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:23,699
of him but it's a part of it it's like

649
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,860
ethanol and fuel it's a percentage it's

650
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,538
in clothing it may not be a hundred

651
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:29,399
percent him but it's going to be a

652
00:26:27,538 --> 00:26:31,379
blended you have that you know

653
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,960
technology is a really cool stuff is

654
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,460
batteries the carpet structure people

655
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,919
you know hemp and batteries but if you

656
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:41,340
read into it it's that it replaces the

657
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:43,140
heavy metals and lithium ion batteries

658
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:45,439
and that carbon structure is very

659
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:48,778
similar so you reduce the cost

660
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,179
significantly so really it's as a

661
00:26:48,778 --> 00:26:54,179
commodity yes I mean yes you have the

662
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:57,480
CBD but it's like comparing apples on a

663
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:59,100
tree to Pine and hardwood they're very

664
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,900
different for different uses I mean sure

665
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:02,699
you can use wood from an apple tree but

666
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:06,179
for industrial use that's not what

667
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:09,659
you're using so I do think for the very

668
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:11,700
long term that that hemp is here is hemp

669
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:13,799
is sustained and we're only in it for a

670
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,538
very short time you know for the United

671
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,500
States anyway for other countries longer

672
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:18,839
but

673
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:21,538
you know it's it has established itself

674
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:23,459
it will be here it will grow and as a

675
00:27:21,538 --> 00:27:25,980
commodity as others have noted in their

676
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:29,659
presentations I really think that's

677
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:32,940
where you know where the the end day

678
00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:35,820
hemp will will really succeed

679
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,500
thank you um so we have time for one

680
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:39,418
more question but maybe let's have a

681
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,720
round of applause for the pattern list

682
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:41,720
before

683
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:46,520
are there any questions from the

684
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,519
audience

685
00:27:55,079 --> 00:28:00,778
hi hello my name is Ellie I'm from Tel

686
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,000
Aviv I have a clinic in Israel with a

687
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:04,079
focus on at least six thousand patients

688
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,140
that we

689
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:12,899
uh Aid and I wanted to ask Mr boschida

690
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:15,960
we have uh uh heard that you are working

691
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:18,059
with suppositories and there's been a

692
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:21,058
talking and laughing about this subject

693
00:28:18,058 --> 00:28:23,099
this convention so much so many times

694
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:25,200
and I've been hearing there's so much

695
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:27,658
things going on with this uh kind of

696
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,519
curing of people and I feel like there's

697
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:31,679
not a lot of knowledge do you think your

698
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:33,839
lab can cooperate with other labs and

699
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,419
even bring that knowledge and that

700
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,619
technique because if you can tell the

701
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:39,840
audience about the technique it's

702
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:42,959
amazing and it's curing cancer and a lot

703
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:45,899
of disease and I haven't seen a lot of

704
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,220
techniques like that at doing that I

705
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,740
would love to hear from you if it's

706
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:53,579
something that is possible

707
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:56,220
oh well maybe a little bit about that we

708
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:58,158
help people with this that was the point

709
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,960
why we established

710
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:03,419
Institute and the laboratory so we

711
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,579
monitor also what people are taking from

712
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:06,960
Black Market or whatever for their

713
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:09,778
safety actually

714
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,259
and yes we also teach it's nothing new

715
00:29:09,778 --> 00:29:16,619
in Slovenia because we also teach

716
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:20,179
patients how to take cannabis properly

717
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:23,658
on the different occasions we have

718
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:27,440
lectures like

719
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:31,860
Association for multiple sclerosis or

720
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:34,798
tetraplegic associations and so on and

721
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:36,298
people and or general public in Slovenia

722
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:39,379
is very much aware

723
00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:42,960
of those benefits you know

724
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:46,140
so I wonder why it's not that much

725
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,759
popular overseas like in in the states

726
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:51,659
or Israel but

727
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:54,839
in Europe or in Slovenia or in our area

728
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:57,419
it's very common and yes people have

729
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:59,099
also very good results with many

730
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:01,080
different diseases

731
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:03,119
yeah I heard better results so what's

732
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:05,759
what's making it so

733
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:09,239
we don't what's the magic well we don't

734
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:11,819
it's magic uh it's magic and I think

735
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,579
it's a better bioavailability for of

736
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:17,819
cannabino it's for the human body

737
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:20,460
thank you very much thank you so

738
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:22,678
thank you everybody and

739
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,620
enjoy the rest of the program thank you

740
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:27,530
all so very much

741
00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:27,529
[Applause]
