um I got into the Cannabis field in two

30
00:01:22,938 --> 00:01:29,219
2017 when medical cannabis

31
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:31,938
um became legal in Germany and

32
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:34,920
um yeah I had the opportunity to

33
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:39,478
administer a big trademark portfolio

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,759
from a canada-based firm so that was

35
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:43,920
really exciting because uh obviously

36
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,799
back then everything yeah it was a new

37
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,719
field and I had the opportunity to get

38
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,140
the whole development from from the

39
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:55,259
start and by now we are not only doing

40
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,478

43
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,920
Etc

44
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,799

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,038
to your expert expertise later now I

46
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:14,520
have to say hello to Virginia Garcia

47
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,859
first he's founder of cannabis now which

48
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,260
is one of the biggest English-speaking

49
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,260
cannabis Publications worldwide is that

50
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:25,199
right correct so uh

51
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:28,500
how did cannabis now develop within the

52
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,179
last years where since the legalization

53
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,520
in the states or since the legalization

54
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,340
of many states in the United States

55
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,560
uh thank you and um welcome everybody

56
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,340
really appreciate being here with you

57
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,659
all

58
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:46,259
we started cannabis now in 2009 in the

59
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:48,840
United States it originally be was uh

60
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:51,539
developed as a medical journal for

61
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,719
cannabis and enthusiasts and users with

62
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:58,560
a strong political focus and at the time

63
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:01,800
there was a lot of media available but

64
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,860
mainly it was focused on either the

65
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,540
unfortunate terminology of a Stoner or

66
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,640
the Breeders so there was a lot of

67
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:11,759
European media it was very focused on

68
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:14,818
breeding seeds genetics and then there

69
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:17,519
was the traditional uh Publications that

70
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:19,500
were really focused on the uh aggressive

71
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,019
use of cannabis so we believe that there

72
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,318
was a new consumer coming in the future

73
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:27,480
that would be an enlightened Enthusiast

74
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:30,899
somebody that would really care about

75
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:33,018
education about plant medicine about

76
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,599
spirituality about health and wellness

77
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:38,939
uh and about moving the industry forward

78
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:42,719
so we created cannabis now to be that

79
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:44,639
voice for the new cannabis consumer and

80
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:48,120
we knew we were early but we didn't

81
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:50,119
quite realize how early we were fast

82
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,459
forward to

83
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,560
2023 here in Berlin we're still about

84
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,239
only halfway through the Journey of

85
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,699
where I think we will end up as a

86
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:04,920
community and as cannabis media

87
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:08,339
expression so cannabis now is a print

88
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:10,679
digital social media and in-person Media

89
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:15,360
Group and we mainly operate in North

90
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:17,340
America we are in the only magazine in

91
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,639
airports in the United States so we're

92
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:23,279
in 58 airports Nationwide in Hudson News

93
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,918
which is a testament to the type of

94
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,319
content that we produce and we have a

95
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,139
social media community of just over 4

96
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,519
million so

00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:34,439

98
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:37,819

00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:48,600
to you is Simon Espinoza is that right

102
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,699
and that's right yeah I think Spanish is

103
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,379
not so good and I'm glad to have my

104
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:55,020
second panel with him I already already

105
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:57,659
had the penalt before which was uh we

106
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:59,939
really enjoyed it last year I think and

107
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,939
um how did things develop with your

108
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:04,918
publication called or voila or on voila

109
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:08,399
yes

110
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:10,500
so uh we started this uh Community it

111
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,478
was not a company when it started it's

112
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,899
it's it has always been a community and

113
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:18,478
started 10 years ago uh and then that

114
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:20,519
has evolved to become what is now which

115
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,918
is the most watched cannabis media in

116
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:25,379
Spanish we started we're based in Chile

117
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:28,859
but now we have outgrown our Frontiers

118
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:32,279
and have um reached new communities

119
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:36,919
across the glove all in Spanish so Spain

120
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:39,239
Mexico Colombia Argentina Peru and

121
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:40,918
surprisingly enough Florida and

122
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,139
California where half of the people

123
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:45,359
speak Spanish and like nobody's

124
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:47,220
communicating cannabis in Spanish which

125
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,699
was a great opportunity for us to you

126
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:53,039
know feel that Gap and what we do is we

127
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:55,379
communicate educational and scientific

128
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:58,439
content in a fun way all our hosts of

129
00:05:55,379 --> 00:06:00,839
our shows in social media are stand-up

130
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:02,519
comedians or really funny people I'm the

131
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:04,619
less funny at all so I'm sorry about

132
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,680
that I have some jokes though we can

133
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,959
share if you want but uh yeah that's

134
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,418
what we do we try to communicate in a

135
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,819
fun way in a very approachable way and

136
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:17,159
kind of a bringing kind of these two

137
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:19,259
mainstream place where stigma does not

138
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,840
longer exist and where cannabis users

139
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:24,720
are free to be funny and intelligent at

140
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:27,000
the same time so that's what we did so

141
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,880
education thank you very much so your

142
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,918
education is a very important part of

143
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,560
cannabis marketing I would agree on

144
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,899
because uh you always have to justify

145
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,600
cannabis Marketing in a way and it's the

146
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:44,339
best way to justify marketing for a

147
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:47,340
track of course is education and we

148
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:50,038
you're an online platform you do online

149
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:52,859
work mostly yes but or genius you're

150
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:55,439
doing classical print print magazine as

151
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,240
well of course you're active online

152
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,819
but you're doing a classical print

153
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,620
magazine which everybody says at the

154
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,539
moment oh no no don't invest in print

155
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,340
magazines that does not work do you

156
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:08,519
agree agree on that

157
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:11,399
I agree that if you do anything poorly

158
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:14,099
it will not work but I also agree that

159
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:15,899
print medium whether it's books or

160
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,300
newspapers or magazines or whatever

161
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:20,879
you're doing is more challenging than

162
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,400
it's ever been however from a technical

163
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,399
perspective

164
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:28,739
high quality Niche which is a small

165
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:31,098
Publications are actually on the

166
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,319
increase at least in the United States

167
00:07:31,098 --> 00:07:38,399
not to get too esoteric with everybody

168
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:41,280
but we all have these with us and the

169
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:45,000
digital Revolution is fully

170
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:46,559
in our system right now and we all spend

171
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,439
a significant amount of time on our

172
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,759
phones I'm sure a quarter of the

173
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,959
audience right now is looking at their

174
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:57,180
phone so we are absorbing media in five

175
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,579
four three different ways all at once

176
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,740
and what is going to end up happening

177
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,300
which has already started to happen is

178
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,478
people are going to make the conscious

179
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,400
decision and they are already

180
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:10,939
subconsciously making the decision to go

181
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:13,978
back to non-digital

182
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:15,959
non-screen forms of entertainment and

183
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:19,740
media our brains are not going to stop

184
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:21,899
we're now these humans that absorb media

185
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,900
and it's part of who we are now as a

186
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:27,598
species but so our brain still wants to

187
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:30,239
be entertained and educated but the the

188
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,458
drain that we're getting from our TV

189
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,038
screens that we have in our pockets is

190
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:37,918
now pushing us back to traditional and

191
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:40,860
different forms of interaction so in

192
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:44,458
person is coming back and print is

193
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,080
coming back and on a more basic level if

194
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:49,559
you have a print magazine that is

195
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:53,339
telling very very Dynamic interesting

196
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:55,199
stories and is made in a way that will

197
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,940
hold up over time that is not just meant

198
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,360
to be thrown away but maybe archived or

199
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:02,580
put on a coffee table and that will last

200
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,620
that is what is being successful and if

201
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,899
you don't hit those marks it's very easy

202
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:11,220
not to be successful

203
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:12,899
yeah so the truth is uh no matter if you

204
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,240
publish as a print magazine or you

205
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:19,019
published online you have to get some

206
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,120
Revenue by advertisement you have to you

207
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:23,940
know that you know that and I'm glad we

208
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,060
have an advertised expert here and also

209
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,640
we I have to tell that to our American

210
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:33,000
and Canadian audience or non-german

211
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:35,580
audience that you may not know

212
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,379
or maybe you know that in Germany you're

213
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,019
not allowed to advertise for medical

214
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:42,899
cannabis recreational Cannabis is

215
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:44,759
illegal so how can you advertise for

216
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:46,500
cannabis and that's what your customers

217
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:48,899
ask you

218
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,360
correct

219
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:53,879
um first of all maybe I go one step back

220
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,740
before we go into what is allowed to

221
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:57,179
advertise and what is not

222
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,220
um

223
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:01,259
for some of you it might be obvious but

224
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,360
sometimes it's not um so I would like to

225
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:06,659
share that so um it's very important

226
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,060
that you get brand protection

227
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:13,439
um we know in U.S it's not possible to

228
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:15,659
get a federal wide trademark protection

229
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,019
but in Germany or in Europe that's

230
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:21,899
different since 2017. so that would be

231
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:24,120
the first you should think

232
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,860
um when you come to Europe to get brand

233
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,600
protection

234
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,700
um

235
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,459
yeah in the beginning it was hard but

236
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,680
nowadays it's not a problem even for

237
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:38,338
goods and services for recreational

238
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:41,159
Cannabis which I must say it's it's uh

239
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:42,899
astonishes me because it is illegal

240
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:44,578
however

241
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:47,100
um you do get treatment protection we

242
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:48,000
file it all the time so that changed

243
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,500
totally

244
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,919
um the only thing you have to be aware

245
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:55,940
of use trademarks which do not have the

246
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:58,740
word cannabis or something related like

247
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,839
wheat or pot or whatever in there

248
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,959
because the European court of justice

249
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:06,959
still

250
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:08,278
holds that this um yeah infringes public

251
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,018
morality

252
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:12,600
so you you don't get a trademark

253
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:14,639
protection for that but apart from that

254
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,519
um go for go for trademark protection

255
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,799
the first step now

256
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,720
um the next thing is can you advertise

257
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:24,899
it and

258
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,420
I agree it's I'm astonished when my U.S

259
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:29,700
and Canadian clients tell me well this

260
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:31,379
is what we did in in the US please tell

261
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,060
me if this is possible in Germany as

262
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:35,519
well

263
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:39,599
um usually I I have to decline it's not

264
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,639
possible somehow even though yeah it's

265
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,519
very strict um usually when we talk

266
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:46,860
about cannabis mainly well cannabis we

267
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:48,539
we cannot as you just said there is no

268
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,539
advertisement allowed at all because

269
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:53,219
recreational Cannabis is illegal and

270
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:55,019
medical cannabis you're you're not

271
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,720
allowed to advertise in Germany because

272
00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:00,480
it's a few pharmaceutical preparation so

273
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,519
what we have is CBD products that's what

274
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,459
we're checking claims for CBD products

275
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,820
here in Germany and there is usually

276
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:10,319
what we see is that

277
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:12,899
the industry wants to make some

278
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,200
beneficial health related claim

279
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:18,480
and that's a big problem like uh yeah

280
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,120
makes you easy to sleep or some

281
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,899
something what it actually does because

282
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,539
the courts then say well we know we want

283
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:31,620
scientific proof for that and I haven't

284
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:34,620
seen any Court uh case law yet in

285
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,019
Germany which would hold that in the end

286
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:40,019
there was

287
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:43,078
at least according to the Judgment there

288
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:47,759
was not sufficient scientific proof so

289
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:49,379
so far health related advertisement is

290
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:54,179
not possible

291
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:56,220
so if I'm not allowed to talk about the

292
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:59,159
beneficials of a plant or the

293
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:02,399
beneficials of the medicine can I talk

294
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:04,500
about my brand openly I may have mention

295
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,320
my brand if it's if it's not merely

296
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,480
related to cannabis so may I advertise

297
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,180
for my brand if I don't advertise for

298
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:16,139
the specific medicine yes absolutely you

299
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:17,458
I mean we do see legal advertisements of

300
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:21,139
course but just

301
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:24,659
don't say like anything health related

302
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:26,639
uh yeah so it's possible if I want to

303
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:29,278
bring in the medical cannabis strain in

304
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,519
the German Pharmacy I could not mention

305
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:35,759
the I I will not mention the specific

306
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:38,039
cannabis brand but I can mention my um

307
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,740
my my company brand

308
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:42,899
on advertisement but as you stated

309
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,539
earlier medical cannabis you cannot

310
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:47,958
advertise it at all what you can is

311
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:51,120
provide information about it

312
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:53,099
yeah like guidance something like you

313
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,620

314

um not yes but you're not allowed to

315
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,959
like promote a specific medical cannabis

316
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,479
product okay and I'm not allowed to hire

317
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,699
a agency to promote it for because well

318
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,700
you can but then you might get sued okay

319
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,800
okay thank you very much so uh how do

320

321
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:16,500
do how do how do advertise for medical

322
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:20,399
cannabis in Chile thank you so uh first

323
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:24,000
of all um the regulation down there it's

324
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,559
known as strict as the German regulation

325
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,679
nothing is as strict as German

326
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:32,638
regulation though that's true sorry but

327
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:35,039
it's true but um that being said all the

328
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,919
content that we've done it's educational

329
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:41,059
and for educational purposes and you

330
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:44,219
have to be also very very careful on

331
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:46,379
what specific words you used when you

332
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,600
refer to certain I don't know if you're

333
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:50,759
going to talk about chemical profiles if

334
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,920
you're going to talk about effects about

335
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:54,620
or any of those you have to be very

336
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:57,838
careful on the information you provide

337
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,519
you have to make disclosures first so

338
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,100
you have to take care of yourself and

339
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:05,278
generate this sort of ecosystem in which

340
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:08,220
you let your viewers and your audience

341
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:11,458
know what's the purpose is the specific

342
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,440
purpose of every publication first so

343
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:16,679
you have to Nest them under this

344
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:20,100
umbrella of protection uh 18 plus

345
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:24,359
content educational content etc etc

346
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:26,879
and uh after that you have to be in

347
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,919
charge of uh like do a follow-up to your

348
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,019
content because things change and

349
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:33,838
something that you publish like years

350
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:36,419
ago on YouTube channel can be or can

351
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,699
raise the Red Flag by certain specific

352
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:40,679
institutions and then you have to react

353
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:43,500
to that before you get in legal trouble

354
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:45,838
I experienced that a lot of time also as

355
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,639
on my YouTube channel I experience I

356
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,100
have to agree I experienced that a lot

357
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:53,639
of time times that I got banned and

358
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:56,399
banned or I got strikes it was not

359
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:59,120
pleasant you know you you can't you try

360
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,740
I try to contact YouTube A lot of times

361
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,320
and they don't they just don't answer

362
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:06,120
why they give you the block or why they

363
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,920
block you why they give you give you the

364
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,139
strike so you have to find it out

365
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:12,419
yourself last time my YouTube channel

366
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:14,639
was blocked it was quite interesting was

367
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:17,578
because I had a contract with a seat

368
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,519
company advertising on my channel

369
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:24,979
for already 10 years and overnight

370
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:28,019
YouTube changed rules and the seed

371
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:30,839
advertising was illegal although seats

372
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:32,519
were not illegal to advertise in in in

373
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:34,380
in the countries where they are illegal

374
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,179
and that's and I advertise for Spanish

375
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:40,019
teeth company so it was for sure not

376
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:41,638
about German law but overnight I got two

377
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:44,220
strikes and my channel was nearly

378
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:46,198
blocked because I had a very short

379
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,560
advertisement for seats in the beginning

380
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:51,778
of my of each episode so I had to cut

381
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:54,359
off the seat advertisement of each

382
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:56,458
episode and I'm still working on that

383
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,079
may I add something to that it's very

384
00:16:56,458 --> 00:17:01,439
interesting point

385
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:04,259
um just want to make clear that in fact

386
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,019
if you choose to use one of the social

387
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:10,318
media platforms it's their playground so

388
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:14,400
they make their own laws which is legal

389
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:17,519
and with um yeah posting something and

390
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,798
agreeing to their terms of condition

391
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,539
um you you agree to it so even though it

392
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:25,259
might be illegal under German law or

393
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:27,178
whatever it's their own law yes I never

394
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:30,720
complained about it because it's I know

395
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:32,759
it's it's this has nothing to do not

396
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,579
press freedom of press I have my on my

397
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:37,500
own homepage but I don't reached any so

398
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:40,619
many people on my own homepage but if I

399
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:43,679
go to YouTube It's if as if I enter a

400
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:45,298
bar if the if the owner of the bar he

401
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,759
doesn't like their face he just can ask

402
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:50,279
me to go out it's the same the same with

403
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,900
YouTube you know freedom of press is

404
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,460
nothing which has anything to do with

405
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,640
YouTube especially when it comes to

406
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,440
cannabis I agree to their rules and if I

407
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,259
break the rules and they make the rules

408
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,240
I have to draw the consequences it's not

409
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:05,400
YouTube so this is why I never thought

410
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:09,120
of suing YouTube and I've had this

411
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:11,519
problem since 2006. the first uh my

412
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:14,579
first episode on YouTube was blocked in

413
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:16,798
2007 because I showed how to grow

414
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:19,259
peppers indoor

415
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:21,058
but only it was just a pepper growing

416
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:22,919
indoor and it was blocked and I got

417
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,899
striked for growing peppers on the light

418
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:29,220
sorry for interrupt no no worries no

419
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:31,620
worries so the way we've understand this

420
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,240
is a there is these guidelines that's

421
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:35,699
how they call it right like the the

422
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:39,240
rules of a certain specific social media

423
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:41,220
platform and I got myself into a

424
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,798
conference of media I was not supposed

425
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,900
to be there but I got myself in there so

426
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:47,759
I could talk to someone that worked in

427
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:51,240
YouTube in a high level position right

428
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:54,058
and I got myself the meeting and then he

429
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,880
they explained very clearly why those

430
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:58,678
guidelines are no are not clear that and

431
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,660
that that's the issue with with social

432
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:03,419
media platforms first they can change

433
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:06,900
change their guidelines without any like

434
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:09,419
previous uh warn uh secondary those

435
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:12,720
guidelines are quite often like uh

436
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:14,940
General so that they can decide like in

437
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,819
in different aspects on how to proceed

438
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:21,660
uh according to themselves and not a

439
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:24,599
third party and they do uh they do say

440
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:27,298
though that um the promotion of of

441
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:29,219
consumption of any uh regulated

442
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:33,418
substance it's not allowed in their

443
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:35,279
platforms so uh what we've find out is

444
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:36,900
that you have to be prepared to get

445
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,119
strikes if you are in the Cannabis

446
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,460
industry no matter what your strategy is

447
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,619
you can get your YouTube channel banned

448
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,500
your Instagram account like taken away

449
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:50,519
and so the only answer to that is to

450
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:53,460
have your own strong platforms or your

451
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:55,440
own platforms as strong as possible so

452
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,058
your website you can say anything you

453
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,240
want on your website nobody will take it

454
00:19:57,058 --> 00:20:02,519
down right this one and then there there

455
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,558
is other platforms there are sorry there

456
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:05,519
are other platforms that are wheat

457
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:08,879
friendly

458
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:11,160
Twitter LinkedIn those platforms you can

459
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,260
publish anything you want like as long

460
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,500
as it's not like like you know something

461
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:18,960
that uh uh sorry offensive

462
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,940
and I think that um

463
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,579
you know some of what you're saying is

464
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:26,340
is not only true but it's also

465
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:28,379
indicative of the future of marketing

466
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:32,159
um

467
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:34,919
social media doing you doing your

468
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,960
content on other people's platforms is

469
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,120
is almost we're almost at the point

470
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,179
where that's the past and what you're

471
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:45,000
talking about is the future but

472
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:46,679
we can still use it so for a community

473
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,259
like ours which has four million

474
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:52,559
followers it would be ridiculous for us

475
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:54,359
not to try to monetize that but we know

476
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:57,779
that we don't own it so we put very

477
00:20:54,359 --> 00:21:00,659
little investment into it but we do it

478
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:02,879
as value added for our clients so we

479
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,980
will charge clients money for marketing

480
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,679
and services that we control

481
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,660
but as a free value add we will say and

482
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,700
we will publish it on our on our YouTube

483
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,580
and we will publish it on our social

484
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:17,220
media but we we can't make it our core

485
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:20,839
business because it would jeopardize our

486
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,839
business too much to rely on that

487
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:28,139
how do you advertise or how do companies

488
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:30,000
advertise for a medical cannabis in the

489
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,400
US we talked about Germany we talked

490
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,220
about Chile but how do they uh how how

491
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,620
is it advertised the answer depends on

492
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,798
which state you're in because the United

493
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:43,619
States is much like 50 52 different

494
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,879
countries so it does depend on what

495
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:46,500
state and sometimes it depends on what

496
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,740
county and sometimes it depends on what

497
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:52,440
city you're in so it's very complicated

498
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:54,900
the majority of the U.S has actually

499
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,820
very unrestricted laws but some places

500
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,400
like Florida for example has very

501
00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:01,859
restricted laws

502
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,080
but I actually believe that the first

503
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:07,319
place that a company should look to

504
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:09,480
invest to promote their brand in media

505
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:12,658
and marketing and this is a little might

506
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,740
seem not natural for marketers like us

507
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:18,780
to say but earned media and journalism

508
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:20,819
is actually the first Frontier I believe

509
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:23,639
of a positive marketing and media

510
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:26,759
strategy and then you can back that up

511
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,620
so earned media is first and then you

512
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:31,798
back it up and you reinforce it with

513
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:36,418
paid media not the other way around and

514
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:38,038
earned media is what you do for getting

515
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:41,340
free stories

516
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:45,960
based on your value to the community and

517
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:48,298
to people so if you invest in quality in

518
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,960
your own story in your own brand

519
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:53,519
recognition and then hire or have your

520
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,159
own team

521
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:58,859
have relationships with the journalists

522
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,659
the independent journalists who they're

523
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:02,759
not that many out there anymore but

524
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:04,159
there are still are some one over the

525
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:07,919
one right here

526
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:12,179
to tell your story in an authentic way

527
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:14,880
you can get more value from that almost

528
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:17,400
than any dollar that you can pay and

529
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,500
there's no laws against that

530
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:23,519
thank you very much I would agree on

531
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:25,919
that I recently did a job for like in a

532
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:27,960
Florida company called fluent you may

533
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,120
know them it's a dispensary they own

534
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,700
like 70 locations they are publicly

535
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:36,000
trade they're under a lot of scrutiny

536
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:38,460
from like several local institutions so

537
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,058
this is one example we we created

538
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:44,519
content that would explain people how to

539
00:23:42,058 --> 00:23:46,678
get a medical cannabis license in

540
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:49,139
Spanish right so that's what we did for

541
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:51,480
that Community but we couldn't advertise

542
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,799
anything else so it was a very tricky

543
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,960
how to get there but it's already

544
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:57,359
published and you can see it in in our

545
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:01,140
YouTube channel how to get a medical

546
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:04,918
cannabis license in in medical cannabis

547
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:07,259
prescription sorry in Florida and where

548
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:10,080
to buy it is not set but it's sponsored

549
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:12,599
by fluent cannabis right so their kpi

550
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,519
there was to acquire new patients right

551
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:16,740
they need to get to new patients but

552
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:19,798
they cannot do it you know on

553
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,900
conventional ways so that's kind of a

554
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:23,339
service that we provide for for the

555
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:28,380
industry as well

556
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:32,579
I hope it helps so as we see uh

557
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:35,340
the way to thank you for that are only a

558
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:37,399
plus no not no one else please no more

559
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:40,289
Applause

560
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:43,200
thank you for the left no more laughs

561
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:45,720
[Laughter]

562
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,058
they're coming they're coming at the

563
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,480
least expected minute so as we as we can

564
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:54,079
see uh cannabis marketing uh differs

565
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,880
from country to Country I would say

566
00:24:54,079 --> 00:25:00,000
Sheila and the US is more related

567
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:04,140
Germany has a kind of a special role and

568
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,900
if customers ask you uh how uh how how

569
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:09,059
should I build up a company to build up

570
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,400
a good brand what do you recommend to

571
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:13,558
customize the Cannabis company except

572
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,259
not using the word cannabis in the word

573
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:19,379
uh in in the in the company name

574
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:21,538
or not any cannabis related term in the

575
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,700
company name what do you how how do you

576
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:25,919
build up a company profile or when it

577
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,620
comes also to AdWords not advertisement

578
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:31,020
but to bra let me let me let me call it

579
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:34,739
branding

580
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:36,900
yeah actually that's not so different as

581
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,798
from other branches

582
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,460
um

583
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:43,740
the more a name speaks for the goods and

584
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:46,079
services it's supposed to be used for

585
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,419
the better it is

586
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:50,460
but on the other hand

587
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:52,440
um the more difficult it is to get brand

588
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:55,259
protection for it because then it might

589
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:58,019
be purely descriptive so you have to

590
00:25:55,259 --> 00:26:00,900
find with your team marketing team a

591
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:01,679
strong brand which is however

592
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,140
um

593
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,900
there there you get brand protection for

594
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,880
it so it's it shouldn't have the word

595
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,679
cannabis in it because of morality

596
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,559
issues and it shouldn't be purely

597
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:16,080
descriptive and then

598
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:17,519
well then it depends where where do you

599
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:19,918
want to go which is which are your

600
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,440
markets and that is trademark strategy

601
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,419
like usually I my clients come from the

602
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,460
US in Canada so so they already have

603
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:30,240
their marks there and then they come to

604
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,960
Europe that's what we usually see here

605
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,359
um

606
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,740
and then you do yeah you have you go

607
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,139
with the Madrid so-called Madrid

608
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:39,298
protocol International trademark filings

609
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,340
but they all come from over there and

610
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:45,000
then you you we handle the the

611
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:46,139
trademarks from there and what we also

612
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,380
see

613
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:51,659
they especially the Canadian and the US

614
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:54,419
of course because they don't have any um

615
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:56,880
trademarks Federal wise in the US they

616
00:26:54,419 --> 00:27:00,840
go for European protection that we have

617
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:03,000
uh uh the so-called European tradepark

618
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:04,859
office in Alicante in Spain which is

619
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,500
very convenient you make one finding and

620
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:09,778
you have protection 27 in all the 27

621
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,419
member states so that's quite good and

622
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:13,200
then you need Switzerland as well which

623
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:15,659
is

624
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,700
another story then

625
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:19,740
uh yeah that's a quite interesting

626
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,259
because that's a total a different

627
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:26,519
approach than in other countries because

628
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:28,259
it's a restricted so uh so highly here

629
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:31,918
in Germany

630
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:36,179
um but what you uh

631
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:38,159
what you say or other a lot of suing

632
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:40,559
cases that companies get sued because

633
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,720
they do not stick to the rules because I

634
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,519
hear that from time to time as I can

635
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,038
tell you I've already seen a lot of

636
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:48,200
companies just not sticking to the rules

637
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:51,599
yes

638
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:54,120
how probable is it to be suit for this

639
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:56,038
yes and I think that might be also a

640
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:58,379
difference but please correct me if I'm

641
00:27:56,038 --> 00:28:01,919
wrong to like the us or other countries

642
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:04,860
we here in Germany have a really strong

643
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:07,620
um consumer protection so we have a lot

644
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:10,918
of consumer protection associations and

645
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:13,500
they take those cases to court so what

646
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,538
we see it's at least in the Cannabis

647
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,579
field I I don't I'm not aware of any

648
00:28:15,538 --> 00:28:19,619
case where one competitor sued another

649
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:22,379
which would be

650
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:25,259
possible but I don't see that they they

651
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:28,260
just go their own ways but we're not

652
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:30,298
that kind of people you find me we're

653
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:32,038
not that kind of people we wouldn't Sue

654
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:34,019
each other exactly we already have too

655
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:36,298
many problems we have other industry

656
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:37,918
they sue each other all the time so I I

657
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:39,720
agree it's it's the same with the

658
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,100
influenza marketing they're also very

659
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,259
strict rules in Germany but the

660
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:45,899
influencers they don't switch others so

661
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:49,500
but we have those associations and they

662
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:51,059
go to court and the other thing is which

663
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:55,019
is probably

664
00:28:51,058 --> 00:28:58,798
um new for you in Germany it's all case

665
00:28:55,019 --> 00:29:02,058
law so when we talk about

666
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:04,980
um Health claims or influenza marketing

667
00:29:02,058 --> 00:29:08,220
uh all these advertisement related

668
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:10,819
topics we don't have an advertisement

669
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:15,419
agency like in the US

670
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:17,819
which then go after you it's the courts

671
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:20,100
so you always need somebody who sues you

672
00:29:17,819 --> 00:29:22,740
for that and as long there nobody sues

673
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:24,959
you I guess that's why we see so much on

674
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,159
social media which is my probably not

675
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,019
legal

676
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,360
you just continue

677
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:32,418
and when it comes to the fights in the

678
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:34,740
so-called I have to use the German term

679
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:35,720
because that's they are quite High

680
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:40,500
aren't they

681
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:42,120
absolutely yes yeah that's a special law

682
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,519
which regulates

683
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:45,599
um advertisement for

684
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:48,119
um

685
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:49,980
not pharmaceutical preparations but for

686
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:54,778
anything which is beneficial for your

687
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:57,480
health and it says um yeah that you

688
00:29:54,778 --> 00:29:59,940
whatever you claim needs to be true it's

689
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,460
obvious but also when you say something

690
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,140
health related you need the scientific

691
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:08,640
proof for it

692
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:11,340
that's a very high burden the whole CBD

693
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,460
Market is suffering from it I guess and

694
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:16,319
um from this higher hurdle uh I think

695
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:19,079
you can tell stories about the CBD

696
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:21,778
Market CBD uh entrepreneurs are

697
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:22,918
suffering from that absolutely yeah it's

698
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:26,240
a shame

699
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:28,500
well and to speak to the CBD Market

700
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,859
it might be suffering because of

701
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,000
legality issues but also

702
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:35,699
one of the things to remember with any

703
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,038
brand is you have to be true just in

704
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,500
general to keep your customer so you can

705
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:43,740
you can legally say whatever you want

706
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:45,240
but if your product does not stand up to

707
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,220
what you're saying you won't be in

708
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,519
business for long and if you look at the

709
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:52,319
the US CBD Market about 80 percent of it

710
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:54,418
has disappeared in the last three years

711
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,220
not because of Any increased regulation

712
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:58,980
it's just

713
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:02,399
people are either transitioning to

714
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:05,399
different uh more advanced cannabinoids

715
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:08,519
or THC and or a lot of the brands said

716
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:10,798
hey this will do this for you and after

717
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:12,658
spending a certain amount of money it

718
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:15,960
did not do that and they lost the

719
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:17,460
customer and they're gone so legal or

720
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,159
not legal

721
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:22,679
marketing and media and brand loyalty

722
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,980
starts with the value you give to your

723
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:24,980
customer

724
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,980
absolutely I would absolutely agree on

725
00:31:27,778 --> 00:31:30,980
that

726
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,980
um

727
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,140
Simon if it comes to Sheila how you you

728
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:40,079
have a medical cannabis program and

729
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:42,840
Sheila since very recently yeah very

730
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:45,058
like a couple of months ago we legalized

731
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:47,398
a medical kind of issues with a medical

732
00:31:45,058 --> 00:31:49,819
prescription so that's we're very happy

733
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:52,979
about it yeah

734
00:31:49,819 --> 00:31:55,500
so thank you very much

735
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,778
that was a good joke we'll sell that to

736
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,359
the camera so that you yeah

737
00:31:57,778 --> 00:32:02,099
do you feel do you already feel that

738
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:04,918
when it comes to a publication that

739
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:07,500
there's a interest on advertisement or

740
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:09,419
on introducing or educating people on

741
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,119
medical cannabis more than it was before

742
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:16,799
now yeah for sure and it started very

743
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:19,139
quickly so the next day after the the

744
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:21,119
law was set in place formally right

745
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,520
there's this whole process that needs to

746
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:26,219
be published in an official journal and

747
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,019
whatsoever but the very next day we

748
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,659
start getting calls from new

749
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:33,058
dispensaries that were not actually

750
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:34,620
legal formally but they know that

751
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:37,278
they're protected by the medical

752
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:39,658
prescription so they're basically

753
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:41,880
associations that would take medical

754
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:43,440
prescriptions and then provide a service

755
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,059
accordingly to what the medical

756
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,058
prescription says

757
00:32:45,058 --> 00:32:51,240
and we started getting you know um

758
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:53,398
inquiries on how how should they you

759
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,159
know promote themselves in this new

760
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:58,619
space in this news so we had to

761
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,260
basically open a new Aria a new branch

762
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:04,139
of our company that would only assess

763
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:06,480
them right on how to properly engage

764
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:09,778
with us or with any other Media company

765
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,058
or agency so there is a huge increase in

766
00:33:09,778 --> 00:33:13,919
interested in this area uh it needs to

767
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:16,619
be taken care of I think there's a lot

768
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,140
to say still that we don't know than how

769
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:22,859
it will unfold but we do know that

770
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:26,220
there's already a certain framework for

771
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:28,979
for uh what to what you can do and

772
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:31,440
cannot do with regulated substances and

773
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:34,259
we are sticking to that frame until

774
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,620
there is like a new new

775
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:40,558
um updates on cannabis specifically but

776
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:43,918
so far we are advising them to promote

777
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:47,460
the same way they would do with Vicodin

778
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:50,840
right but basically yeah so we're doing

779
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:54,360
Vicodin shows now it's very profitable

780
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:56,339
we don't know as a work I hear very

781
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:58,740
often when it comes to cannabis

782
00:33:56,339 --> 00:34:01,558
regulation yeah and every country

783
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:04,140
especially also in Germany we don't know

784
00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:06,658
it's a it's a very common uh phrase when

785
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:09,059
it comes to we want to regulate cannabis

786
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:10,980
within this and this time but we don't

787
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:13,079
know how to do that yet I will hear that

788
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,500
in Germany every every day what I would

789
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:19,559
say which on the other hand of course

790
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:22,139
creates gray areas because no no country

791
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:23,338
decided to legalize from one day to the

792
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:26,639
other

793
00:34:23,338 --> 00:34:30,000
going from a black to a white Market

794
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:32,940
within with a state of decriminalization

795
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,739
as Germany plants means also to accept

796
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,260
the gray Market

797
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:40,319
not a lot of people think of that going

798
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:42,300
from White from black to white in the in

799
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,099
the middle is gray and if we

800
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:47,220
decriminalize

801
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:49,500
which is which is not legalized we

802
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:51,358
accept a gray Market everybody uh

803
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,820
California did that even Switzerland

804
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,378
does that there except gray areas when

805
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:58,080
it comes to home growing for example

806
00:34:55,378 --> 00:34:59,940
Switzerland is accepting gray areas

807
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,460
since over 10 years

808
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:04,260
and how is that for a lawyer in the

809
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,000
industry where you have to work with

810
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,859
gray areas that's that's what I wanted

811
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,639
to know from you Margaret

812
00:35:07,858 --> 00:35:12,659
well we we had a of course trying to

813
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:14,639
solve

814
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:16,559
solve problems you want to be

815
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,900
um not just to show our clients what

816
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:21,719
they cannot do but what they can do

817
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:25,019
and but in this typical now in this

818
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:25,799
specific field at the end it's we tell

819
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:28,619
them

820
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,019
what the law says and then we tell them

821
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:33,838
what the risk is and here's they break

822
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:35,880
it here's a very good four four minutes

823
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:38,400
and 20 seconds

824
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,380
or less expression of a gray area this

825
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:45,539
is a real example

826
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:50,519
uh in March of 2020

827
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:53,159
no in 2021 March of 2021 the a lawyer uh

828
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:55,259
sent a letter to the DEA in the United

829
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:57,779
States and he said hey there's a gray

830
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:00,720
area in the United States can we sell

831
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:03,180
seeds in the United States it's a gray

832
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:06,779
area DEA which is the federal government

833
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:09,598
of the U.S regulatory can we do this

834
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:12,599
certain amount of time goes by and the

835
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,280
DEA response with a letter saying hey

836
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:16,220
lawyer

837
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,820
the DEA

838
00:36:16,219 --> 00:36:23,098
deems seeds as hemp they are no longer

839
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:25,920
uh deemed a controlled substance in our

840
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:28,680
purview we will not be going after seeds

841
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,619
or genetics they are a food commodity

842
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:33,960
and and they are a hemp product thank

843
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:36,720
you very much the lawyer published that

844
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,460
Lo that letter on the internet

845
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:40,559
nine months later

846
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:43,619
cannabis now was working with a client

847
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:46,259
called Royal Queen seeds who is a

848
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:47,160
genetics seed company from Europe who

849
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,040
had

850
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:52,019
decided to come to the United States

851
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:54,119
because of that letter because it was

852
00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:55,858
safe to now sell outside of a gray

853
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:57,960
Market it's still a little gray but a

854
00:36:55,858 --> 00:37:01,500
lot less gray after that legal letter

855
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:04,858
was published and we teamed up with them

856
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:08,519
to take over the New York City Times

857
00:37:04,858 --> 00:37:11,159
Square building at 4 20 for an

858
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:13,980
advertisement but we did it in a very

859
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:16,799
unique way what we did was we teamed up

860
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:19,500
with Royal Queen seeds to celebrate 420

861
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:22,140
and it was not an advertisement to hey

862
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:24,659
buy our seeds and grow marijuana it was

863
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:26,759
let's celebrate the fact that we can

864
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:29,399
grow cannabis legally in the United

865
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:33,359
States using these seeds brought to you

866
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:36,300
by Royal Queen seeds in cannabis now and

867
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:40,799
we had a party in Times Square at 4 20

868
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:42,720
gave out 200 free joints or more and the

869
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,539
news station showed up and we got over 4

870
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:47,219
million eyeballs on the on that story

871
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:49,500
you couldn't pay for that kind of

872
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:52,139
marketing uh and it's a really good

873
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:55,139
example of how we identified a gray

874
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:56,759
Market that had become a lot less Gray

875
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:59,098
and for the lack of a better word

876
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,339
exploited it for the benefit of

877
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:01,338
everybody

878
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:07,199
but it always takes a while till a black

879
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,480
market becomes white and I would say if

880
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:13,319
you don't accept the time the gray uh

881
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,539
the the great the the gray area takes uh

882
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:17,880
we have uh we are in talent and you know

883
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:19,980
and and nobody I think nobody likes uh

884
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,619
what's going on in Thailand right now if

885
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:24,960
you legalize one two one to one uh from

886
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:27,000
one day to the other overnight if you

887
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,000
legalize overnight this is also a big

888
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,679
chaos and uh yeah so I think from a from

889
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,179
a legal perspective though I think or or

890
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:35,279
from a media perspective I think that

891
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:38,399
also with the gray area if we look at

892
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,980
the gray area and then we push on it

893
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,900
specifically we might actually find out

894
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:45,900
or get a response that it's less gray

895
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:48,720
than we thought or actually turn it from

896
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,119
Gray to Green yeah this is this is what

897
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:52,679
I think we should all work on because

898
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:54,838
Germany wanted to legalize without a

899
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:57,598
gray area and they worked on it for two

900
00:38:54,838 --> 00:39:00,000
years and then they understood okay we

901
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,338
have to accept this gray gray area with

902
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,760
the three plants and 25 grams because

903
00:39:02,338 --> 00:39:08,519
everybody knows 3 grams and three plants

904
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,500
does not mean you can grow a lot of

905
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:12,838
cannabis out of three plants more than

906
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,119
your own need so of course they accept

907
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:17,519
gray areas and they found out after two

908
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,920
years of discussing with lawyers and

909
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,019
they're checking a ruler and federal law

910
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,420
that they have to accept this career

911
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:26,940
area if they want to have a proper

912
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:29,519
legalization I think we have one I'm

913
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:31,320
sorry that I interrupted you but I think

914
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:33,059
we have one more minute for a question

915
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,539
if anybody from the audience wants to

916
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:35,539
ask a question

917
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:40,820
thank you

918
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,820
no jokes

919
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,740

hi my name is Luke Monroy I'm a

931
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:31,199
filmmaker and uh like Mika I'm also in

932
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:33,300
the realm of like thinking about ways of

933
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:36,059
you know collaborating with Brands and

934
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:38,039
knowing that this issue is all around so

935
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:40,019
I really like the the last example you

936
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:43,199
gave because it's actually an example of

937
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:45,019
how to empower the issue and not

938
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:48,480
standing there as a

939
00:40:45,019 --> 00:40:50,338
sponsor right but as a collaborator in

940
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,358
the car so I would like to know of of

941
00:40:50,338 --> 00:40:54,480
you

942
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:56,098
um what other examples in the in the in

943
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,019
the last few months or years come to

944
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:01,200
your mind when it comes to very creative

945
00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:03,599
way of pushing the Cannabis subject out

946
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:06,899
in society

947
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:09,119
well I I will say that a minor example

948
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:12,300
of that is what we're doing here today

949
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,039
at ICBC I'm I'm here uh with Jason

950
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:16,920
Washington who's in who's in the front

951
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:19,139
row I'm I'm here with my wife and my

952
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,838
baby boy who's over there and we are

953
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:24,900
here um we're filming a documentary on

954
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:27,838
cannabis culture and education in Berlin

955
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:30,660
and in Europe and we've invested our

956
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:32,940
time and our money to uh document what

957
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:34,559
we're all doing here today so this will

958
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,960
turn into a film project that we will

959
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:38,940
then distribute for free to people who

960
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,980
want to learn about not everyone can be

961
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:43,320
here we're in a very unique important

962
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,940
group that a lot of people wish they

963
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:48,180
could be here and whether it's time or

964
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:50,400
health or money they're not and um so

965
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:51,960
this is a really real world example of

966
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,300
us capturing this moment and then

967
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:57,800
Distributing it globally for people to

968
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,800
create change with

969
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:08,579
I personally think when it comes to that

970
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:09,780
aspect we should focus on prevention and

971
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:13,039
youth protection

972
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:16,140
because this is a very important topic

973
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:18,659
and when it comes to

974
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:21,118
the people who do not want to have a

975
00:42:18,659 --> 00:42:23,759
cannabis industry in this country this

976
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:25,740
is also this is always the topic where

977
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,540
where it comes to we have to protect

978
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:29,699
Youth and we cannot protect our youth

979
00:42:27,539 --> 00:42:32,219
with the legalizing cannabis but if we

980
00:42:29,699 --> 00:42:36,179
do a proper harm reduction work if you

981
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:39,480
do a proper safe I use work it will be

982
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:43,259
much easier for the whole industry

983
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:45,780
to to have Revenue here and if you

984
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:48,180
really give them good protect prevention

985
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:50,099
and protection concept for our youth for

986
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:52,559
our youngsters because this is what

987
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:54,599
Society is afraid of and this has a

988
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:57,659
doubt this is a win-win situation

989
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:00,539
because we protect the youth and we help

990
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:02,460
our industry to act more free more

991
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:04,800
freely and this is the last word I

992
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:07,318
wanted to say here we we should not

993
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,240
neglect that political issue of youth

994
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:12,000
