1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,639
so hello everybody welcome back to

2
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,280
um

3
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:17,759
i guess cannabis technology

4
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:20,559
so i know that a lot of you are very

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,118
very interested in in these issues uh i

6
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:25,439
think today we're going to be discussing

7
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:28,320
the many many ways that

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,160
technology generally is going to be

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,280
if not has already begun to

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,679
revolutionize our business so cana tech

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,760
is a very very broad term

12
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:38,558
but what i'd like to do is start with

13
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,479
some

14
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:43,119
sort of to give you an understanding of

15
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:46,159
how broad this is and how

16
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,679
many aspects of the cannabis industry

17
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,479
technology effects starting with

18
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,000
legalization but beyond that we have

19
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,878
some very very interesting panelists

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,198
today with a wide range of technology

21
00:00:54,878 --> 00:01:00,000
that's being deployed right now and the

22
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:02,159
impact on our industry is going to be

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,679
really really huge so

24
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,599
i'm going to start with a question that

25
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,478
i'd like everybody to answer in a very

26
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,039
short

27
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:12,000
um sound bite kind of way

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,400
what and where do you see technology

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,239
playing a role in the cannabis industry

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,280
and maybe everybody can give a very

31
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,118
brief

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,079
introduction of what they do and how

33
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,079
that's important as well

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,040
well hello everybody

35
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,359
i like what lisa just said

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,079
said something about us all needing to

37
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,078
work together

38
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,399
we are integrating things we are

39
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,478
integrating technologies and you talk

40
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,478
about the technology i think this is the

41
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:45,200
perfect place to say that

42
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,078
we can all drive this forward

43
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,240
both

44
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:51,199
on the product as well as the

45
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,359
technologies used to actually grow

46
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,359
cannabis and so

47
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:58,560
this is a very interesting topic and i'm

48
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:00,319
very happy that she brought that up it

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,879
we're in this unique place that we can

50
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:05,438
all work together and i i love that

51
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,399
opportunity um technology itself can

52
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,799
help us

53
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,239
create new products new chemicals well

54
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,840
mark can you tell them what you're

55
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,360
you're in grow tech right what does that

56
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,319
mean exactly so we grow

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,440
we

58
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:19,519
create

59
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,560
facilities to grow

60
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,400
cannabis

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,598
and food and vegetables

62
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,439
and we

63
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:29,839
think about sustainability i want

64
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,318
as my mission i belong to the 60 plus

65
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,920
that the previous speaker talked about i

66
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,679
want to make

67
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:38,479
the world a better place for my children

68
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,560
and all of your children and so

69
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:43,199
sustainability is one of those

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,199
possibilities that we want to push in

71
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,439
order to have a more sustainable world

72
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,719
and that's what we're trying to do okay

73
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,318
so i'm going to actually bounce over

74
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,840
here to lucas because he's also in

75
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,399
grotech although from the american

76
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,719
perspective um where do you see

77
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,280
technology playing a role in grow tech

78
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,400
and how does that use and and why is

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,158
that cool

80
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,959
sure so you know i think it's a very

81
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,799
broad uh question but it is something

82
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,400
that is very important to the industry

83
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,920
moving forward and

84
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,519
i think a lot of times what we we look

85
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,919
at is new technology and it's not

86
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,840
necessarily that we always need to focus

87
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,679
on the new technology on the cultivation

88
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,039
side of things it's also

89
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,400
addressing

90
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,318
new ways to address old challenges right

91
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,158
and i think in the cannabis industry we

92
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,919
have a lot of what we refer to earlier

93
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:29,919
as the black market i like to consider

94
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,199
it as the legacy growers right is

95
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,919
understanding

96
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,839
where they came from this plant and and

97
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:39,039
really how we learn from that and build

98
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,878
it into a commercial optimized uh scale

99
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,479
so that we can have a consistent quality

100
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:45,598
product going forward for both the

101
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:48,238
medical and for the adult use markets

102
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,759
so zia you're also coming to this from a

103
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,319
very different

104
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,798
role with some very very new technology

105
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,878
used in new ways but generally what do

106
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,159
you think technology is going to mean to

107
00:03:56,878 --> 00:03:59,280
the cannabis industry from your

108
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,199
perspective

109
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,759
yeah thank you

110
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,759
oh um we are coming also from uh

111
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,438
software development and we were

112
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,639
developing different technologies in

113
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:14,799
fintech and healthcare technology

114
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:17,439
and we saw that the industry is in need

115
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,319
of new technologies from the software

116
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:23,120
technology perspective and that's why

117
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:26,399
there is a huge perspective uh in just

118
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,399
to to move forward and to develop uh new

119
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,758
technologies indeed in the software

120
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,399
there are

121
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,199
a lot of done but uh

122
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,918
a lot much more can be done in

123
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,919
cannabis industry well actually you're

124
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,159
using a technology

125
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,519
artificial intelligence and you're not

126
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,400
the only one up here that's going to be

127
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,560
using ai can anybody else talk about why

128
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,399
ai specifically is going to be very very

129
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,759
useful to this industry in several

130
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,638
different ways i mean maybe starting

131
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,280
with sales right yeah i mean just a

132
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,840
short hello merry uh is a

133
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:04,239
like traditional e-commerce platform

134
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:05,439
what we did uh we added uh we developed

135
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,439
uh

136
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:10,639
ai-based voice assistant

137
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,560
which brings the level of the customer

138
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,759
journey in different level whether you

139
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,319
don't have to

140
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,919
and all information which is in the in

141
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:22,639
the in the verb or in their uh

142
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:25,279
let's say data they will be given to

143
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,639
customers or to doctors or to

144
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,359
just the person who is looking

145
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,960
information very fast that's what

146
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,160
we see the technology is to bring new

147
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,599
technologies to the industry to help

148
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,199
and contribute

149
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,400
so what about you to be as you're coming

150
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,960
this from something a little bit

151
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,000
different nanotech which is really out

152
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,198
there

153
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,439
what what does canotec mean to you

154
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,240
nanotech sounds extremely fancy many

155
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,199
things

156
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,519
to come back to the start um technology

157
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,759
is always an answer for a problem and

158
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,839
three years ago we defined the problem

159
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,199
our visionary founder mr targa deibus

160
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,638
defined a problem and that is the low

161
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:04,079
bioavailability of cannabinoids and

162
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,360
there was an answer in the scientific

163
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,918
literature

164
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,759
drug delivery systems predominantly used

165
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,240
in the pharmaceutical field and we

166
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,720
adapted this technology to make a

167
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,439
carrier system that helps your body

168
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,080
absorb cannabinoids faster to a higher

169
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,800
extent and with longer lasting effects

170
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:25,599
and one thing we combine our carrier

171
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,000
systems with uh synergistic combinations

172
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,080
of active ingredients to get specific

173
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,918
effects with high bioavailability

174
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,639
cannabinoids so i think you can see that

175
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,120
everybody up here is using technology in

176
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,879
different ways to make their jobs easier

177
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,120
as my late uncle peter drucker used to

178
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:44,240
say technology is great but it's just a

179
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,240
tool and if it doesn't achieve your ends

180
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,240
then don't use it but let's do a little

181
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,759
bit more of a deep dive into some of the

182
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,918
specifics

183
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,280
what i'd like to focus on is you know

184
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:57,279
what exactly is grotech is it about the

185
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,679
breeding of the plants is it about the

186
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,598
building is it about the tracking tech

187
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,079
is it about automation is it about

188
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:06,319
sustainability the two grow tech guys

189
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,079
what what how does that work sure so i

190
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,759
think i think there's really two silos

191
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,879
that that really fits in the first is

192
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,840
going to be in automation as you

193
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:13,519
mentioned

194
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,198
and that's really in terms of driving

195
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,758
down the cost production producing a

196
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,759
very consistent clean quality product by

197
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,199
leveraging that automation um on the

198
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,520
front end of the cultivation side of

199
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,680
things um the other silo is really going

200
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,918
to be on the techno the technical side

201
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,038
in terms of data right so how are we

202
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:30,639
actually growing these plants what are

203
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,639
the climates that it's that it's

204
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,120
thriving in um and what are the climates

205
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,519
that are creating stress and um you know

206
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,280
informs for pest disease pathogens

207
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,359
things like that right so i think it

208
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,279
really comes down to you know how we how

209
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,960
we gather that data how we

210
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,198
translate that into information and then

211
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,120
use that into insight for our our

212
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,319
growing needs well we have we actually

213
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,240
this is great basically we've got an

214
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,560
american grow tech and a german grow

215
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,240
tech so so i'm going to also then throw

216
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,160
this out to mark how do you see this

217
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,680
kind of technology aiding in the

218
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,520
assistance of say meeting high

219
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:06,959
compliance standards like eu gmp or gacp

220
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:09,120
or sustainability etc etc

221
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,719
the wonderful thing about technology is

222
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,879
that you can combine

223
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,520
what nature gives you

224
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,599
for example the sun

225
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,918
with the technology to control the

226
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,839
environment to make plants happy it is

227
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,079
in the end we all want happy plants

228
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,839
because they give us the best product

229
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,240
and so the question is how do we how do

230
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,959
we make the best combination um with

231
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,599
that we can use ai

232
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,799
to control the climate to pick the right

233
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,680
cultivars

234
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,278
to grow the best plants in the shortest

235
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,918
amount of time to make the most of my

236
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:44,240
money and that is a business conference

237
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:46,159
here and so we're trying to do

238
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,278
the best we can with the technologies

239
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,559
that are out there and then we're

240
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,480
developing and pushing these

241
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:55,119
technologies that don't only apply to

242
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,278
cannabis they will also spill over which

243
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,440
is really exciting partly in the food

244
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:03,120
industry and food production

245
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,920
as well as into climate control etc for

246
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,399
for housing for example and skyscrapers

247
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,519
and all of that so this industry is

248
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,278
driving

249
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,159
a lot of parts

250
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:16,879
into our society and it is exciting that

251
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:19,278
we have the opportunity to be part of

252
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,120
this forefront of a new technology that

253
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:23,120
is emerging well i think every there's a

254
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,799
theme here which is the technology is

255
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,360
being combined so i'm going to throw

256
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:30,079
this back to zia who uh hello mary is

257
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,759
actually you know uses uh ai to create a

258
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,920
customer journey that is really

259
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,838
different and i think in general ai is

260
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,399
like the future of sales in general but

261
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,399
why is it so important to use something

262
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,278
like say medically trained ai and

263
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:47,039
cannabis in a sales application

264
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:48,639
um yeah as i mentioned we are our team

265
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,039
coming from healthcare

266
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:53,120
digital healthcare and when we see their

267
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,679
perspective of using

268
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,879
as we discussed before data

269
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,679
i mean

270
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,039
using ai or new technologies in cannabis

271
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,838
will give us

272
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,399
much knowledge to

273
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,000
develop a

274
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,839
current market to

275
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,240
to develop new instruments for medical

276
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,240
cannabis i mean medical cannabis is a

277
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,278
next uh

278
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,440
kind of there will be a fusion of the

279
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:19,039
digital

280
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,160
technologies with medical cannabis

281
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,439
that's one of the products we're

282
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:26,319
developing as well where we'll have uh

283
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,240
the the data will be used explicitly for

284
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,240
that purposes now we're working also

285
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,399
with one

286
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,159
software uh developing with one software

287
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,078
where we'll get

288
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:40,639
medical data from variable devices

289
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:43,039
this is part of our

290
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,679
product development and that

291
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,199
information will give

292
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,559
customer uh

293
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,640
will be kind of a breached in the

294
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:53,838
telemedicine between custom patient and

295
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:56,319
a doctor if the doctors want to see how

296
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,360
the specific cannabis or those or strain

297
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,959
affects to the patient that's i believe

298
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,240
it's the new future and we're also

299
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,479
working on that

300
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,639
so so i want to flip back over to bs can

301
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,360
you tell us in layman's terms what

302
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:12,879
exactly nanotechnology is

303
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,879
i'm relatively sure i can try

304
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,320
um

305
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,600
basically if you are in a

306
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,839
certain size range um below 500

307
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,320
nanometers depending on the definition

308
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,839
then people speak about nanoparticles

309
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,640
nanomaterials

310
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,800
and

311
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,439
if you have sizes that low then some

312
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,838
physical parameters change giving

313
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,360
interesting opportunities for new

314
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,600
technologies

315
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,079
so so when you are you using this with

316
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,920
what bioavailability can you give us

317
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,838
a sense of what you're using

318
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,838
nanotechnology for

319
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,720
again i try my very best

320
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,200
let's start with the term

321
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,000
bioavailability

322
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,160
it describes the fraction of active

323
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,078
substance that you take in that is

324
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,159
actually absorbed by your body in

325
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,319
contrast to the amount of substance that

326
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,958
you take in and that is metabolized and

327
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,399
released without being used and for cbd

328
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:08,078
the official who number is six percent

329
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,879
meaning more than ninety percent of the

330
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:13,199
cbd you take in simply goes to waste is

331
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:16,078
not used by your body and this is where

332
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,639
we come in with our technologies we help

333
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:20,638
your body with absorbing cannabinoids

334
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,440
and other active ingredients by

335
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,079
transporting them them in nanoscale

336
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,600
lipid carrier systems okay what what

337
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,599
does that mean in english right

338
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:35,679
milk is an emulsion

339
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,600
two immiscible liquids homogeneously uh

340
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:39,199
dispersed now you have an oil droplet

341
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,320
and you make it really really really

342
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,040
small

343
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,800
50 nanometers you fill this oil droplets

344
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,879
with cannabinoids

345
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:47,679
and stabilize it

346
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,480
um

347
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,159
within so-called emulsifier

348
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,959
so that's like mayonnaise basically

349
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:54,240
right

350
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,679
exactly

351
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,480
okay

352
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,879
and

353
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,759
those small particles they give the

354
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:04,720
active ingredient a huge surface

355
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:07,600
between oil and water and they

356
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,480
they help these active substances to

357
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,879
transfer into the aqueous phase for

358
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,000
example in your liver or into your

359
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:18,879
gastrointestinal tract

360
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,278
and provide a huge surface for

361
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:22,399
absorption by mucosal membrane so it

362
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:24,240
makes everything more efficient

363
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,919
basically right

364
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,759
you can sum it up with that word yeah

365
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:30,240
awesome so the next thing that i'd like

366
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,159
to get to is the idea of technology in

367
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,639
personalized medicine which i think

368
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,000
everybody up here is involved in in some

369
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,519
way and we were actually talking about

370
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,600
this in the green room i mean when it

371
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,039
gets to that point obviously you'd be

372
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,639
able to have

373
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,958
a system where you can find the best

374
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,519
medication that you need and maybe back

375
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:49,599
that into a plant which is growing you

376
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,039
know a greenhouse or an indoor grow

377
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,600
which is growing for people who need

378
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:56,240
that and then it's put into some sort of

379
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,800
you know high absorption nanotechnology

380
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,120
but um where do you see personalized

381
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,958
medicine cannabis and technology

382
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,120
crossing

383
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,679
and how

384
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,399
oh uh good question actually that's uh

385
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:14,239
that's exactly where we say ai can play

386
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:17,600
a big role to to find um

387
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,919
personalization of and finding a product

388
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,120
uh that the customer or patients are

389
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:25,039
looking for

390
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,039
and we just observe how

391
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:29,120
high tech is

392
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,599
developing in not only in software also

393
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,198
in the hardware and cannabis hardware

394
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,000
yeah i mean we were discussing a few

395
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:38,559
days about this high-tech vaporizers

396
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,679
just to see to find a personal

397
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,319
uh

398
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,399
dosage or personal use how they can help

399
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,639
that's uh i i believe

400
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,600
uh not on the software but also hardware

401
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,360
will be play will be playing a important

402
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,680
role because other industries they're

403
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,199
already using it's just have to

404
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:57,759
uh

405
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:00,000
get more attention and i believe with

406
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:02,240
the legalizations will be more attention

407
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,839
to bring available

408
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,839
on the market technologies to the

409
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,199
cannabis industry lucas you're coming

410
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,360
from the american market which is very

411
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,519
very different can you see a time when

412
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,839
say in colorado there's going to be a

413
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,519
green you know a section of greenhouses

414
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,360
that can grow your own personalized

415
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,600
medicine is that

416
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,959
feasible viable how far away is that

417
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,320
yeah so i think it's a great question i

418
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,958
think you know what it really comes down

419
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,720
to is is driving two things is the is

420
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,719
the genetics right and and the

421
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,440
cannabinoid profile that comes from this

422
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,120
plant and and specific genetics and the

423
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,639
consistency and the cultivation they're

424
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:39,039
in right um as we refine our practices

425
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,240
downstream of harvesting um we need to

426
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,639
ensure that the product that we're

427
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,320
producing before that harvest is is

428
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,560
consistent right and and we have a

429
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,199
consistent basis that we're building uh

430
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,838
for this post-harvest processing um as

431
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:54,078
it gets more complex right and and if we

432
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,000
are going to um which i absolutely

433
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,638
believe enter more of a medicinal market

434
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,078
that's specific to each patient

435
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,440
and we can hone in on those different

436
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,278
aspects of different genetics and

437
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,199
different cannabinoids

438
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,480
the cultivation absolutely needs to be

439
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:08,319
dialed in and that's where we really

440
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,720
need to leverage that technology that

441
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,879
automation and those systems

442
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,720
to really refine that environment right

443
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:16,799
and then build this build this genetic

444
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,320
code within the plant as we cultivate it

445
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,399
all the way through harvest so that

446
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,759
everyone on the back end can can use

447
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,240
that precision

448
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,360
to to really refine it to each patient's

449
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,360
needs so from from colorado to germany

450
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,000
can you see personalized medicine within

451
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,680
an eu gmp framework and how do you think

452
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,600
that that might work and be aided by

453
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:36,799
technology

454
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,159
well

455
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:43,439
we're happy that gmp and gacp is going

456
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:45,360
to be pushed it's it's helps us all

457
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,440
to create better

458
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,399
plants healthier plants

459
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,959
and

460
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,519
have a consistent process and we're all

461
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:56,559
into that we also have the possibility

462
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,959
using ai to actually looking at the

463
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:02,000
chemicals and how to infect these

464
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:04,958
chemicals by changing the climate just

465
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,759
like lucas has said that the beautiful

466
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,360
thing is for me as a chemical engineer

467
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,119
like the old saying you give a kid a

468
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,879
hammer and everything looks like a nail

469
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,479
but once you are

470
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,799
a chemical engineer you look at the

471
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,759
plant not as a plant necessarily by the

472
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:22,000
chemical factory so which

473
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:24,318
changes can i make to the environment to

474
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,679
create the changes in the plant that i

475
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:27,438
would love to see

476
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,400
we need people

477
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,720
like to be us to tell us how to

478
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,960
what they need and how to actually

479
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,000
deliver those chemicals and that's it's

480
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,960
an exciting prospect to

481
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,319
change things still holistically

482
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,880
not talking about

483
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:46,558
isolating one specific

484
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,080
um

485
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,798
chemical but

486
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,639
having still a plant that creates a

487
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:55,679
holistic

488
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:59,200
medicine and so

489
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,038
in that scale you have to use

490
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,759
massive amount of data to actually

491
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,640
create what you need to do and that

492
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:07,919
takes

493
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,120
technology so to be as i want to sort of

494
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,200
get into some of this because i think

495
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,519
that nano is absolutely on the front end

496
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,558
of personalized medicine can you talk a

497
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:16,960
little bit about not just the

498
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:18,480
nanotechnology but things like patches

499
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,360
and the things that you're doing to

500
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,160
bring

501
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:25,038
cannabis as personalized medicine into a

502
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,919
medical stream that can be used

503
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:29,759
talking about a vision yes many things

504
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,960
what is important for personalized

505
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,359
medicine i would say is that you control

506
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,919
which substances you give a person okay

507
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:40,639
this is quite clear but how much is

508
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,320
applied and if you look at the

509
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,120
the the body them

510
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:47,599
as an individual system it is hard to

511
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,759
control how much of a substance is

512
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:51,279
really absorbed taken in and there comes

513
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:53,440
nanotechnology

514
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:56,079
in play and especially what you

515
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,960
mentioned patches with patches you can

516
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:00,960
control how much substance is

517
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,360
applied to a person with the right

518
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,640
combination of substances according to

519
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:08,798
the needs of a specific patient you have

520
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,200
personalized medicine the right amount

521
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:13,200
over the right amount of time

522
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,519
that's awesome so so a lot of you guys

523
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,640
were mentioning data so now the next

524
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,359
question is

525
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,559
what is the role of regulation and

526
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,918
compliance within tech and gdpr is just

527
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,399
one of them but would anyone like to

528
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:29,038
take that one on first

529
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,440
oh well i can take a stab at it um so so

530
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:34,240
we work uh pretty heavily on the um the

531
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,720
gacp and gmp side of things uh largely

532
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,160
with our our lp clients up in canada and

533
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,319
with some some of the clients who work

534
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,320
out here out in europe with and

535
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,319
the large uh portion of that is in the

536
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,599
process flow right of how people plants

537
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:47,759
and products move throughout these

538
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:50,879
facilities and tracking that a lot of

539
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,480
gmp compliance and and gacp compliance

540
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,240
come with a chain of commands right

541
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,679
understanding really what happens in

542
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,679
these facilities and what happens to

543
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,080
this plant throughout its growth stages

544
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,840
um and and leveraging technology to

545
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,439
gather that data so that we can create

546
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:06,158
that chain of commands right and we can

547
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,240
we can show that very clearly throughout

548
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,159
from seed all the way through sale so

549
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,640
ziya i mean this is also an issue right

550
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,720
so so your system is going to be using

551
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,440
ai but potentially can be pushed to very

552
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,880
personal devices and wearable devices do

553
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,200
you see privacy and gdpr being an issue

554
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,640
and beyond that what other regulatory

555
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,558
issues do you see

556
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,640
crossing into this space

557
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,240
yeah i mean it's a big issue the i mean

558
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,759
we are german-based company but the

559
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,599
reason why we are going actually to

560
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:36,240
start at us of course it's the biggest

561
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:38,558
market market another reason is because

562
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,960
of the regulations uh i mean european

563
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:43,119
gdpr regulation regulations does not

564
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,519
really allow personal assistant

565
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:48,079
to uh suggest you

566
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,918
you know a product uh that's a big

567
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,839
problem with voice assistant we can't

568
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,679
get to that it's like medical device

569
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,879
license we can't get to that and we have

570
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,720
we are planning to to go uh for that but

571
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,440
in the beginning it's uh

572
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,440
us's more liberal market for that uh of

573
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,960
course there are their own limitations

574
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,679
when we are talking about uh

575
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,240
recreational and medical cannabis and us

576
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,919
drug not only government limitations but

577
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,440
also different corporate limitations or

578
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,840
banking limitations what we are like

579
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,038
facing uh once we're going to such

580
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:22,000
market but uh we feel how it changes

581
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:24,400
that that really i mean recently

582
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,400
from our perspective uh for instance

583
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,320
apple was

584
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,038
not really supporting

585
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,399
cannabis based applications recently

586
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:34,879
they just issued that they are like

587
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,440
welcoming now uh applications which are

588
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,159
considering also cannabis so we

589
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,759
we observe to change how uh

590
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,840
not only legislation is changing but

591
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,720
also uh

592
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:47,119
corporate policies changes in the

593
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,440
positive side which is good

594
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,519
so i want to come back now to tobias you

595
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,000
know nano is interesting in and of

596
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:56,319
itself right especially in europe and it

597
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,159
potentially could really sort of stretch

598
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:00,480
the edges of things maybe you can

599
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,559
explain a little bit how that might be

600
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,279
or in terms of i mean if you have you're

601
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:07,440
using a new kind of technology like nano

602
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,279
and it's delivering cannabinoids into

603
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,200
the cellular level i mean you're

604
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:13,200
starting to talk about manufacturing at

605
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,440
a cellular low level in a human body

606
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,360
which is pretty wild right i mean that's

607
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,279
also pressing certainly in europe there

608
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:22,879
are all sorts of laws that discuss those

609
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:24,558
things um can you comment on that and

610
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,960
and sort of where you see your

611
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:29,279
technology developing in a strange

612
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,440
regulatory space just because of the

613
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,599
unusualness of the technology and how it

614
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,840
impacts the human body

615
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,158
yeah interesting question

616
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:39,759
give me just a few minutes and i answer

617
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,640
in two points first the definition of a

618
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,919
nanomaterial given by the um

619
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,080
[Music]

620
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,400
eu regulatory

621
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:51,119
now the framework is um the definition

622
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,640
is if you are below 100 nanometers

623
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:56,158
if you have a solid

624
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,640
and if it is not biodegradable then you

625
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:01,600
have a technically produced nano

626
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,640
material and this needs extra testing

627
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:06,079
safety standards so on and so on which

628
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,159
is needed

629
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,480
if you have a nano scale metal inside of

630
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,480
one of your cells it can cause oxidative

631
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,558
stress

632
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,240
inflammation degradation of proteins all

633
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:17,119
sort of problems that you do not want to

634
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,200
have

635
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:21,439
now for our systems they are in the

636
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,759
range below 100 nanometers or carrier

637
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,000
systems but they are liquids and they

638
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:28,960
are absolutely biodegradable because we

639
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,839
build them with regular food ingredients

640
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,319
plant oils lecithin as emulsifier and

641
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:36,798
some other substances and those

642
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:38,879
particles they they don't

643
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:40,720
they don't cross the barrier of your

644
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,840
cells they don't really go into your

645
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,720
cells they help active fat soluble

646
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:48,959
substances to be transported into your

647
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,120
cells it's a different different way of

648
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,558
of transportation

649
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:58,959
so we are not producing nato materials

650
00:23:54,558 --> 00:24:00,960
according to eu regulations and

651
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,600
there is no harm in our carrier systems

652
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,600
because they follow the after

653
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,839
after releasing the active ingredients

654
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:10,319
they transport they follow the standard

655
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:11,599
route of digestion

656
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:12,798
so i'm going to throw out another one

657
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:14,558
because that's actually for those of you

658
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:17,440
who've been wandering around outside

659
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:19,839
there's a really cool 3d printed

660
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,600
personal oil maker which is pretty cool

661
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:24,000
but i want to sort of come back into

662
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,558
this idea of 3d printing

663
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,359
how and where do you see 3d printing

664
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:31,440
making an impact on this industry

665
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,678
generally and why and where maybe we'll

666
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,558
start with tobias i mean could you 3d

667
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,559
print your patch

668
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,839
to be honest i have no idea okay that's

669
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,400
fine is anybody else like on the

670
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:46,558
construction side or the greenhouse side

671
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,080
where can you see 3d printing playing a

672
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:49,599
role or not

673
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:51,599
i i mean i think it would be tough i

674
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,439
think where where you may be able to see

675
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,759
it as maybe in sensor technology

676
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,679
possibly um to where you have you know a

677
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:59,440
small let's say something similar to a

678
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,679
raspberry pi right where you could build

679
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,320
a modular around that and be able to

680
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,159
mass produce that off a 3d printer

681
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:08,000
you know there's you know especially in

682
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,440
our world we try to

683
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,720
streamline everything we can when we're

684
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,038
building out these facilities so that

685
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,679
there's not very customizable very hard

686
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:17,119
to get pieces and parts but in the event

687
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,440
that there are that is a lot of times

688
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:21,439
where 3d printing can be leveraged

689
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,440
awesome we want to throw this open to

690
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,519
the audience so if anybody has questions

691
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,200
can you put your hand up and we'll try

692
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:29,839
and get a mic to you

693
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,840
anybody now

694
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:36,798
i have already a question here

695
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,640
oh there you are i didn't see you

696
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:41,639
i should wear my glasses more often hold

697
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,640
on

698
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:49,918
well first thanks a lot for the inside

699
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:53,439
was super interesting uh i would like to

700
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,200
go further or a bit further into

701
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,840
i guess more of a feel where tobias as

702
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,840
active

703
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,679
because like you've been talking about

704
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:04,480
cultivation and it's about distribution

705
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,480
and so on i would be interested in what

706
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,519
perspective or potential would you see

707
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,440
for new technologies in certain drug

708
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:12,558
development like

709
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,480
new

710
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:16,879
yeah stuff like youtube basically you

711
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,558
know nanotechnology whatever do you

712
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,039
think there would also be possibilities

713
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:23,440
to improve i don't know whatever you

714
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:26,640
name it flowers or

715
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,080
different new extracts or

716
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,559
do you see other potentials of

717
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:33,439
technology in making new

718
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:33,440
cannabis drugs

719
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:38,720
i didn't only ask you by the way like

720
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,080
you all can ask anybody i think could

721
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,079
ask to answer that one i think

722
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:46,000
yeah um

723
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:48,158
i believe it's

724
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,200
it can have a huge impact i mean if you

725
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:53,600
look at the uh growing or using

726
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,278
technology and growing it can be

727
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:58,319
you know from the light

728
00:26:55,278 --> 00:27:01,359
that's adopted from the air

729
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:04,480
clear climate which is adopted and we we

730
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:06,798
heard a lot about ai being used and

731
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,319
not only optimizing but that's also

732
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:10,400
optimizing growth i mean if you go to

733
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:13,759
the uh more we were discussing yesterday

734
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,960
with one company here also that uh

735
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:16,720
they are

736
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,960
trying to uh

737
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:23,200
communicate with the uh

738
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:26,399
with the plant uh and and crack uh

739
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,798
the and and uh manipulate the

740
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:31,119
growth yeah that's the

741
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:33,918
more or less biochemists uh by cracking

742
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:36,000
the the growth of the plant i guess

743
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,679
there's a lot has been done in other

744
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,159
plants and

745
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,080
again it will come it's coming

746
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:46,159
and will will be entering to the

747
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:46,158
cannabis growing as well yeah and

748
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,359
i'd like to answer that too i i want to

749
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,079
add

750
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:54,319
that we're now at about

751
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:57,199
production cost of

752
00:27:54,319 --> 00:28:00,000
a kilogram of the highest

753
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:04,159
flower quality that you can buy

754
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,480
at about 500 euro per kilogram

755
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,799
um and i don't know if that's a high and

756
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,480
low number around here i i would assume

757
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:11,918
that for the highest quality that you

758
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,399
can buy

759
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:17,038
that is a pretty decent price

760
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:20,000
for production all in meaning facility

761
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:23,359
and depreciation all of that in

762
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,359
that number will come down because

763
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,599
there are new technologies

764
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,839
that will reduce

765
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,839
the price of

766
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:34,079
growing and it will

767
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:35,759
increase the yields

768
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,439
both of those are happening they're

769
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:41,519
continuously happening

770
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,200
ai adds to that so that that number will

771
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,119
come down

772
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,399
in part it has to because prices will

773
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:48,798
come down too

774
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:49,839
not quite as fast but we are looking at

775
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,158
that

776
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:53,519
at any time it's always how can we

777
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,200
produce

778
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,558
better

779
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,720
at a lower price and technology

780
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,798
in fact we could go into many different

781
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,519
ones it comes from the water delivery

782
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:08,158
system nutrient delivery system that's

783
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,960
all you know anything about

784
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,640
knowledge about the

785
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,120
temperature and humidity in your grow

786
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,640
facility the drying process

787
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:21,199
all of that is continuously evolving

788
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,679
we have never built two of the same

789
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,278
facilities because there's always new

790
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,120
things coming and it's really really

791
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:29,839
exciting and what other place can you go

792
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:33,199
where you can just continuously innovate

793
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:34,879
and it's really that's fun that

794
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,319
so thank you for that question there's a

795
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,799
question here

796
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:41,038
yeah it's a it's a comment on the whole

797
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:42,558
3d printing discussion

798
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:45,038
my name is peter i'm from from the

799
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:47,440
danish company drizzle and we create

800
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:50,240
small extractors designed for for

801
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,360
personal use so the end user can do

802
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,480
their own

803
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:56,319
customized personalized cannabis oil

804
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,079
and we've managed to get a complete

805
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:02,000
extraction system down to this size

806
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:04,240
about two kilograms and doing so has

807
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,960
required a few innovative steps and one

808
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:10,000
of them has to do with plastic and 3d

809
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,000
printing now we've really investigated

810
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,038
into using plastic instead of stainless

811
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,880
steel

812
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:16,319
because stainless steel is super

813
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,399
expensive to work with and it's kind of

814
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:20,720
the go-to thing when you do

815
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:23,199
chemical processing but we figured out

816
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,200
how to use plastic in chemical harsh

817
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,200
environments and

818
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,038
once that was in place and we could do

819
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,200
that in a food safe

820
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:33,519
environment the next obvious state for

821
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,278
us at least was to do the entire thing

822
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:38,398
using 3d print

823
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,759
and that has actually led to some really

824
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:41,918
interesting

825
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,679
derivative advantages in what we're

826
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,240
doing and there's specifically three

827
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,080
things when it comes to 3d printing and

828
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,519
3d printing in production that we've

829
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:52,558
discovered

830
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:54,798
and the first one is innovation speed

831
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:56,960
when you do stuff in stainless steel you

832
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,558
need to have someone do the drawings you

833
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,399
need to mill something out you need to

834
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:03,200
test it and ship it blah blah blah blah

835
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:05,518
it's expensive and takes usually up to a

836
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,519
month if you 3d print you can sit down

837
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,359
over a coffee table sketch something out

838
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,440
print it test it in the evening figure

839
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,278
out what's wrong with it and next cycle

840
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,120
the next day so instead of having

841
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:17,278
iterative cycles of one month you're

842
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:19,359
down to one day so really

843
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,558
charges your innovation speed i'm

844
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:22,639
actually going to interrupt you here for

845
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:24,960
a second but i mean that actually i was

846
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,720
showing that product to a gmp

847
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,480
distributor here in germany and his

848
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,079
first comment was yeah it's really cool

849
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,480
it's 3d printed but actually that's

850
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:34,079
technically illegal here in germany

851
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,159
right so i mean that's one of those

852
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:37,759
areas where i think that i mean as much

853
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,799
as i mean it's a personal discussion

854
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:40,398
right if you're going to make canada

855
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:42,480
butter in your microwave versus using

856
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,398
your you know your system but i mean

857
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,440
that's i think a place where technology

858
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:49,439
is also crossing into a new regulatory

859
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,600
environment so people can actually make

860
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,080
oil at home more easily but how does

861
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:55,839
that then become a standard that the

862
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,240
medical environment that the medical

863
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:59,359
community can accept those are many many

864
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,399
different questions i think that's

865
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:03,038
coming together

866
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:04,319
with your product so i'd like to sort of

867
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,079
we'll come back to you but what i'd like

868
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:07,918
to do is sort of open it up to other

869
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:10,480
questions here unless you had another

870
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,799
point to make i had two quick points i'd

871
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,759
like to make and and the second one was

872
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:18,319
size because when you 3d print stuff you

873
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,558
can put in details that are impossible

874
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:22,079
to make with other production methods

875
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:24,240
and that means that you can shrink both

876
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:25,839
size and cost of your products and

877
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,880
that's important when you do consumer

878
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:29,199
products

879
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,360
and the final thing is production

880
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,440
because it's quite easy to set up

881
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:34,798
scalable production facilities with 3d

882
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,519
print you just need a bunch of 3d

883
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:39,440
printers so you can set up clusters

884
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,359
let's say we want to produce in the us

885
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,480
you can just set up printing farm in the

886
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:46,719
u.s asia and this send send files and

887
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,480
you have the exact same production

888
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,679
globally so you kind of have a global

889
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,200
and local

890
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,880
approach to production that's really

891
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,759
interesting to work with

892
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,120
so

893
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:56,720
okay so i'm gonna have a quick round

894
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:58,558
robin here and i'd like you guys to do

895
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,120
this like really fast what are the

896
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:03,200
biggest challenges and opportunities of

897
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:05,518
technology in this industry like a

898
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,000
sentence

899
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:11,120
for me it's ai and the

900
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,398
appropriate use to to develop better

901
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:14,398
methods to grow

902
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:19,359
generally research science is awesome we

903
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,440
need to find out more new things it's

904
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:23,439
frustrating because often things don't

905
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,200
work and it's expensive because it takes

906
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:29,759
time and it's challenging to explain to

907
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,558
future customers or partners why it is

908
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:35,599
necessary to do research when you do not

909
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:37,599
know what will be the outcome

910
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:40,398
i think it's

911
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:42,398
keeping focused on the goal ahead

912
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:44,319
not reinventing the wheel and leveraging

913
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:46,319
parallel industries to

914
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:48,639
further this cannabis industry into the

915
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:48,639
future

916
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:55,119
i believe right now legislation and

917
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,359
limitations that's a big challenge

918
00:33:55,119 --> 00:34:00,639
for for canadect to be developed in the

919
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:02,398
level where it can be developed

920
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,080
not only in tech but in general cannabis

921
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:05,759
industry i see that's the biggest

922
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:08,239
challenge actually are there any more

923
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:08,239
questions

924
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,839
okay so i'm going to actually come one

925
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:15,118
or maybe our last question what do you

926
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:18,719
see the role of technology in research

927
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,559
and development of new drugs generally

928
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:23,118
if not the advancement of understanding

929
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,119
of cannabis

930
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:26,960
sure i can uh i can start up so yeah my

931
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,559
background's actually in commercial

932
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,480
vegetable production before i started

933
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,559
growing cannabis and you know i think a

934
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,320
lot what needs to be focused on now is

935
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:36,159
largely on the cultivation side but more

936
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,039
specifically is on the genetic side of

937
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,119
things i think there's a lot of um

938
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:42,559
mis understanding around really what

939
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,639
these genetics are and what sort of

940
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:45,759
cannabinoids they produce and what sort

941
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,358
of environments produce those

942
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,960
cannabinoids of that genetic right and

943
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:50,159
so i think a lot of it needs to be

944
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,599
focused on

945
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,119
gene editing and understanding these

946
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:56,159
genetic codes that we have and and the

947
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,760
cultivation systems we use to identify

948
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,280
these things and bring them out in this

949
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,119
product it's an amazing flower that we

950
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,400
have but it really comes down to the

951
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,240
cultivation side of things and the

952
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,200
environment that you put that plant in

953
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:09,439
to allow those those genes to come out

954
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:11,039
okay last call any more questions from

955
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,720
the audience

956
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:14,960
no if you have burning questions you can

957
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:16,879
look us up later but what i'd like to do

958
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,960
is end just a little bit quickly unless

959
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,599
anybody would like to have last closing

960
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,838
comments generally about technology or

961
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,200
what you're doing with technology that's

962
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:26,960
cool and awesome that we need to know

963
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:29,279
about

964
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,880
i uh yeah i i'll i'll say

965
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,040
sorry i feel like i'm talking a lot here

966
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,880
but um automation so i love automation

967
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:36,639
it's the when push comes to shove the

968
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,800
industry needs to commercialize and it

969
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:40,559
needs to optimize itself and that comes

970
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,599
down to as mark was referring to as cost

971
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:43,679
production

972
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,680
we really need to adopt things that

973
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,598
we've learned from our dutch partners in

974
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:50,000
terms of bringing plants to people and

975
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,920
not people to plants right we need to

976
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,159
limit our human touching as much as this

977
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,119
is a very artistic thing that is for you

978
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:56,719
to do

979
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,400
at home right but when we're doing this

980
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:59,838
on a medical platform on a commercial

981
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,599
platform we really need to leverage

982
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:04,078
technology and automation and those

983
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:07,359
systems therein to create a consistent

984
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,359
quality product for the globe um and i

985
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:10,960
think that's really where we focus on at

986
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:12,639
urban grow is is leveraging that

987
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,400
technology those systems and integrating

988
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:16,799
them all together see do you have any

989
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,680
last comments there about

990
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,599
oh

991
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:20,639
um

992
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,838
yeah

993
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:25,440
i guess we mentioned that we

994
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:27,358
we see

995
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,960
new technologies being part of their

996
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:30,480
industry and

997
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,400
with i mean

998
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,159
software development

999
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,680
and hardware development will be

1000
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:36,309
one of the main stuff which will be

1001
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:38,000
happening

1002
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:40,400
[Music]

1003
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,559
this side anybody

1004
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,880
i think what i'm seeing is that we're

1005
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:46,960
still only

1006
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,440
maybe 10

1007
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,159
of the way of where where technologies

1008
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,720
will will go in the following years we

1009
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:57,039
made a lot of progress but there's so

1010
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:57,838
many new things happening every single

1011
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:58,639
week

1012
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:00,960
and

1013
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:02,480
that's to do with lights and nutrients

1014
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,960
and everything

1015
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,358
this industry will change and it's

1016
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,480
exciting to see a change and get better

1017
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:10,799
and i think

1018
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:15,440
that that certainly ends

1019
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,440
with fewer diseases fewer pest pressure

1020
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:20,159
it will get a lot better and

1021
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,240
healthier

1022
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:24,399
over time

1023
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:26,479
would you like the last word here

1024
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,480
the exact last word

1025
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,039
we need more science we need more

1026
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,960
research in this field we need to solve

1027
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:35,759
the problems and not just

1028
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,720
ignore them and i think we all need to

1029
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:42,079
be curious and excited about what we do

1030
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:43,919
and try to improve ourselves

1031
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:47,039
okay well i think that's it unless one

1032
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,480
last call for questions no thank you all
