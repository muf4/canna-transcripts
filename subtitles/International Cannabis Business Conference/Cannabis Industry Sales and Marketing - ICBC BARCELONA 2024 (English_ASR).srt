all right we're sitting thanks everybody

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,679
to spend your time with us today at the

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:09,718
last panel at the ICBC thanks to Eno for

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:13,039
being an amazing host as always and

5
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:15,599
thanks to Alex for giving us a place to

6
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:17,358
gather and and share these dialogues

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,160
because these dialogues are important

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,680
and they're going to steer the face of

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,480
our industry in the

10
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:25,359
future um today we got a very unique

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,359
group of people here we it's almost like

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,880
we're all from very different aspects of

13
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:32,679
the Cannabis industry uh but when it's

14
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,839
sales and marketing it's something that

15
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:36,759
affects each and every one of us so what

16
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,160
I'll do is I'll go through the panelists

17
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:39,920
and get them to just do a short

18
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,919
introduction so you know who they all

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,160
are uh and then we'll go through some

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,920
questions so why don't we start with you

21
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:49,398
good sir my name is uh BR worle I'm from

22

impressive 72,000 kilos huh yeah I like

35
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,439
those numbers numbers are fun uh Jonah

36
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:29,599
Barber from decimal you want to give us

37
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:31,798
a little introduction yes I Jonah Barber

38
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:35,158
with decimal engineered systems we

39
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,399
actually started back in 2012 in Oregon

40
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,880
with uh starting from a analytical

41
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:40,680
testing site we were one of the first

42
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,000
fully accredited cannabis and HP testing

43
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,479
labs in the US we got started in

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,959
building extraction equipment actually

45
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,560
based off test results uh being from the

46
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,879
lab side we were unique because we got

47
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,079
to see a lot of the products that were

48
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:53,478
coming in what was popular and we

49
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,919
started seeing a lot of oil come in

50
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:58,200
overnight back in like

51
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,280
2014 and a lot of the oil just had very

52
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,640
heavy solvents in it uh um just a lot of

53
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,079
contaminants not very safe oil for

54
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,118
consumption especially in the medical

55
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:09,239
Market side and so we looked at um

56
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:10,318
opportunity talk to a lot of our

57
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,319
customers that are using other

58
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,318
extraction

59
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:16,000
technology and realize there was really

60
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:17,518
no repeatability very low level of

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,039
accreditation or

62
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:21,599
compliancy and we saw an opportunity

63
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:24,079
where we could build automated equipment

64
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,799
that was repeatable highest level of

65
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,400
accreditation and so that's where we

66
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,239
started MX extractors back in 2014 and

67
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,120
then since we just evolved as a company

68
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:36,439
to offer uh more eth uh extraction

69
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,680
Technologies such as ethanol hydrocarbon

70
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:40,239
distillation isolation and now we

71
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,360
focused everything on building for eug

72
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:46,360
GMP compliancy and so we're essentially

73
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,120
an oem um technology provider for the

74
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,360
extraction industry beautiful beautiful

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,280

now a total of 25 when you add the the

97
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,120
legal market and what we've done is

98
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:59,000
we've been able to create sort of like

99
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:04,120
an ecosystem from everything the media

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,719
to merchand to apparel to events and uh

101
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,480
our big claim to fame was that uh we

102
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,959
sort of like uh followed some of the

103
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,598
stuff we saw over here in Amsterdam and

104
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,680
here in Barcelona and we started the

105
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:20,719
first consumption Lounge in Time Square

106
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:25,160
now fast forward uh we are going to be

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:29,320
the first group to open two legal adult

108
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:32,639
use retail dispensaries this year one in

109

Manhattan and one in Brooklyn and uh

110

just really excited to uh bring all our

111
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,199
talents resources and knowledge to the

112
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:44,879
adult youth retail Market in New York

113
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,639
and hopefully abroad soon all right

114
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,959
awesome man thank you for that um Jonah

115
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,918
we'll start with you I wanted to see um

116
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:55,079
you know the Cannabis industry seems at

117
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,279
times to be extremely crowded often

118
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:58,719
really even

119
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:00,879
saturated um how do you position your

120
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,800
company to stand

121
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:07,879
out you know I I think for us it really

122
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,520
came down to um I think accreditation

123
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,000
and also being able to offer a wide

124
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,240
array of equipment offerings you know

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,120
we've never just tried to force a a

126
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,720
certain type of equipment or product on

127
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,000
a customer it's really more about we

128
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,479
view the customers as partners and

129
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,038
during that process like you really have

130
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:25,359
to get to know the the partner and

131
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:27,360
understand what their goals are what

132
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,720
their what they're trying to produce

133
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,919
what their product matrices are their uh

134
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,960
their budget their throughput and not

135
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,719
just try to make someone fit in a box

136
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:38,038
from that side and so we've really kind

137
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,479
of approached it that way and we

138
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:42,800
actually go through a

139
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:44,680
very um a pretty extensive like what we

140
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,520
call like a discovery process to where

141
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,400
we actually go you know sit down with

142
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:50,439
the customer go through expectations on

143
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,879
both sides and really just try to make

144
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:54,560
sure it's the right fit you know for

145
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:56,439
everybody from that side and you know

146
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,560
sometimes you know a good deal is

147
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,680
walking away from a deal if it's not the

148
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,240
right fit you know for the the customer

149
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,240
um and ourselves from that side and then

150
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,199
beyond that I think just being able to

151
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,680
provide a level of automation that we're

152
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,840
really known for I think an industry

153
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,120
that really separates us from our our

154
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:17,439
competition is automation from an

155
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,199
operator standpoint but also with data

156
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:24,439
and analytics um as well and then um

157
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,360
with service and support and then from

158
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:27,918
again what's most important for us is

159
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,000
how we positioned ourselves in North

160
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:33,598
America nobody's asking for GMP um I

161
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,439
don't think have anyone in the US do

162
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:37,399
that but we knew the importance if we

163
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,000
wanted to be taken seriously in Europe

164
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:41,679
that we had to do eug GMP and so we

165
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,240
really went down that path about four

166
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,038
years ago to do that to position

167
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,879
ourselves today and so that's where we

168
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:50,959
feel like we can also bring a lot of

169
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:52,478
knowledge to the C our customers are

170
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:54,239
Partners in Europe because we've been

171
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,560
doing this for 10 years in the US but

172
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,918
then we also add the whole EU GMP side

173
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,000
to it so that's where we feel like we

174
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,159
can bring a lot of additional value

175
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,720
awesome thank you great

176
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:10,639
answer um Jose I had it all lined up

177
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,440
here yes I'm reading off my phone um

178
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,680
what are the potential implications of

179
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:16,839
international cannabis legalization and

180
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,199
regulations for businesses operating in

181
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:21,439
Europe and how can these companies

182
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,280
prepare for these

183
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,839
changes

184
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:29,000
yes uh the companies who already was

185
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:31,318
working in Europe the last 30 years 20

186
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,279
years 50 years we have to adapt our way

187
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:37,280
of work to the new to the new situation

188
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,839
we have here in Europe no because we was

189
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,679
working in the past for unregulated

190
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:43,638
Market H with the unregulated market and

191
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,439
the requirements now are different than

192
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:49,240
before no uh I will uh speak about four

193
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,478
points in my point of view is the more

194
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,639
important thing we have to do the first

195
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:58,000
thing is uh adapt our products to the

196
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,960
laws and the regulatory er er

197
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,560
regulations of each country

198
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:04,359
that we have the other thing is transmit

199
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,879
the information more concrete more

200
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:11,680
precise that until now because uh the

201
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,199
the the market demands this kind of

202
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,000
information no we have to use other the

203
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:20,120
other means that we have like LinkedIn

204
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,158
Instagram YouTube videos podcast videos

205
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,199
uh we have to also look for synergies

206
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:25,519
and collaboration with other companies

207
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:28,120
no I think it's very important this

208
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,198
point I for example sell nutrients but I

209
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,120
try to create a net work around me

210
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,360
around my company to offer a wider

211
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,399
support and offer everything the

212
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,038
customer may need no and uh the last

213
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:40,599
point and in my point of view also the

214
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,958
more important is the quality the

215
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:46,519
quality the quality and the and the

216
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:48,719
after sale service that until now if s

217
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:51,080
only a few companies already did it in

218
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,959
the in the right way no so basically

219
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:57,879
these four points is is is the key no

220
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:59,239
for for me okay thank you great answer

221
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:01,240
uh Brett I wanted to ask you the same

222
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:05,560
question question that I asked Jonah

223
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:07,519
because uh if you sold 72,000 kilos uh

224
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:09,439
I'm figuring that you positioned your

225
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,000
company to stand out in a very good way

226
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,240
so please tell us how you did that yeah

227
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,879
so we we looked at the consumer model

228
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,639
and went backwards um you know the hemp

229
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:23,000
industry is uniquely

230
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:24,600
positioned um with a regulatory model

231
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,360
that's completely different than

232
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,920
traditional uh cannabis it's a more open

233
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,320
market in most senses I'm sure people

234
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:32,838
have seen products like Delta and in a

235
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,600
gas station or in Europe they've seen

236
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:39,959
hhc around um these products because of

237
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,000
the you know openness to the to the

238
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:43,679
products have seen a huge surge in

239
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,839
demand I don't know who heard Bo Whitney

240
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,399
earlier but I'm pretty sure he said a

241
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:49,880
number like 28 billion the US market in

242
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:52,039
hemp is around 28 billion doar which

243
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:54,360
makes it larger than the Cannabis market

244
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:56,838
and that only happened since 2018

245
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,480
essentially in the US and the reason for

246
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:01,240
that again is is because there is a

247
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,959
openness to the product you know just

248
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,839
like a nicotine Vape it's right there at

249
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,518
the gas station or at the counter where

250
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:08,519
someone could pick it up easily and try

251
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:10,200
it in case they don't you know don't

252
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,159
want to go to a dispensary or don't have

253
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,839
access to a dispensary so you know

254
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,639
there's also directed consumer ship

255
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,320
shipments that we can do in the US and

256
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:18,720
the same in Europe kind of like Amazon

257
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:22,000
where you know you can have a vape at

258
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,759
your door in 24 hours or 48 hours so

259
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,360
what we did is we we took that and

260
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,039
looked at what the consumer really

261
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,959
wanted which is ease of access and

262
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:31,958
quickness to the product and then we

263
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:33,879
backward integrated into a raw material

264
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,679
company which is a B2B company where we

265
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:37,639
supply all the brands so we Supply

266
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,799
anywhere between 700 900 brands in a

267
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:44,000
given month um and we give them the

268
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:45,359
engine or the the inputs uh for you know

269
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,278
whatever affected consumer is looking

270
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,919
for we have 46 cannaboids in our Arsenal

271
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:51,278
um that are all have different effects

272
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,000
half of them are psychoactive them half

273
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,600
of them aren't half of them help or some

274
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,559
of them help with sleep or pain or

275
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,320
inflammation some of them get you really

276
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,518
high um so it really depends on you know

277
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,879
what the consumer is looking like and

278
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:05,440
we've just made our sales available to

279
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,519
address uh a consumer problem really and

280
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,560
that's what we've addressed and we've

281
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:10,440
addressed it really well and between

282
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:11,919
marketing and sales and you know all the

283
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,240
other core things that matter in a

284
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,719
organization and and Company culture

285
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,560
we've we've hit all those boxes and

286
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,240
we've been able to control a big portion

287
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:24,039
of the market share of what the oil goes

288
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:29,039
out um whether it's CBN THV hhc THC um

289
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:31,519
TP CBC cbga cbda we sell them all oh

290
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,319
very interesting uh Vlad I wanted to ask

291
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,480
you cuz you're really one of the guys

292
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,399
that came from the Legacy into the legal

293
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,278
so first of all thank you for practicing

294
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,240
Civil Disobedience so that everyone that

295
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:45,278
is involved in the legal cannabis

296
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,519
industry can be involved thank your

297
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:50,200
Civil Disobedience uh practitioners

298
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:52,000
because without Civil Disobedience we

299
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,160
would not have the industry that we have

300
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,039
right now and so how you know how did

301
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:59,719
you go about that transition from from

302
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:02,120
Legacy to Legal you know and really

303
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:06,000
continuing to make your company stand

304
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:08,519
out that's a great question um well like

305
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,839
I mentioned before you know

306
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:14,240
uh in 2017 when we started this

307
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,680
consumption Lounge in Time Square it

308
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,198
really took offl and we really noticed

309
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,078
fairly quickly that we were on to

310
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:23,359
something bigger than just selling

311
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:25,479
cannabis it was more of like a movement

312
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,240
and uh we started doing these events

313
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:32,320
once a month 200 people a night to once

314
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:35,240
a week to 7 days a week so in 2019

315
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,360
Forbes called us the Studio 54 cannabis

316
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,320
before cannabis even got legalized so we

317
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,680
knew we were on to something bigger than

318
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,320
just you know typically transactional

319
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:48,479
cannabis and we knew we could not

320
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,160
literally like you know trademark

321
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,519
cannabis it wasn't legal yet in New York

322
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:56,120
so we trademarked the lifestyle and we

323
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,159
started with first we started a podcast

324
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,440
then from then we started a newsletter

325
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:05,360
turned into an E Magazine then from

326
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:08,880
there merchandise then apparel and then

327
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,919
now the brand lived on past than any

328
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:14,799
physical place because now it had legs

329
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:17,919
we had made people feel a certain way

330
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:20,319
for 3 and 1 half years from New York

331
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:24,078
across the country and around the world

332
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,720
and I think that that is something that

333
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:28,559
people are really not really

334
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,800
understanding nowadays I feel like

335
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,439
everybody not only in this industry but

336
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,639
I think in all Industries is looking for

337
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,600
this magical digital bullet where you're

338
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,680
going to push a button and your brand is

339
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,480
going to go Global and I'm a firm

340
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:44,239
believer that authenticity matters you

341
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,839
need to have something tangible that

342
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,839
people felt that there's nothing

343
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,199
stronger in marketing than Word of Mouth

344
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,600
there's nothing stronger than a friend

345
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,758
of yours telling you they recommend

346
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,120
something so I think that you have to

347
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:01,440
have that spark before you can pour gas

348
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,480
veline on it which would be like these

349
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,880
other different digital forms of of

350
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,240
advertisement if not you know they would

351
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,720
never be any new brands everything would

352
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,480
all the ad space and all the biggest

353
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,079
brands would be owned into owned by the

354
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,519
biggest people with the biggest dollars

355
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:17,958
but that's not the case because if you

356
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,519
don't have something substantial

357
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:22,599
tangible where you make people feel you

358
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,959
can't grow from there so that's what we

359
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,480
did Fast Forward after legalization in

360
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:30,359
New York we knew we had to evolve with

361
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,839
the market now we got legalized we

362
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,399
stopped doing the

363
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,399
underground uh lounge and what we did

364
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,240
was I'm a firm believer in collaboration

365
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,720
over competition we started

366
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,198
collaborating with strategic

367
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,440
institutions that made us mainstream so

368
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,958
for example we we partnered with the van

369
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,040
go immersive experience which is a

370
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:52,239
global Art institution we partnered with

371
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:53,838
the Museum of Sex On Fifth Avenue these

372
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,839
are things that what are unheard of

373
00:14:53,839 --> 00:15:00,720
where these big institutions museums are

374
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,199
publicly partnering with us and now

375
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,320
society's looking at us in cannabis

376
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:08,439
differently and I believe that that's

377
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,079
why we were able to penetrate through

378
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,480
all these advertisement rules and really

379
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:15,879
you know make our claim as the biggest

380
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,000
lifestyle Brant in New York because we

381
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:19,360
started with something tangible we may

382
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,399
people feel a certain way we were

383
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,240
authentic and then all the Omni media

384
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,799
channels we created just amplify that so

385
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,639
so that kind of leads me into wanting to

386
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,559
ask you another question right so you're

387
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,879
you know the only retailer on the panel

388
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,679
and and in light of the marketing

389
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:35,838
restrictions in New York state as well

390
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:38,159
as the explosion of illegal dispensaries

391
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,120
throughout NY I want you to share how

392
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,679
you plan to open a legal dispensary in

393
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,759
the face of these challenges but I want

394
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:46,039
to hear it from the perspective of like

395
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,120
you came from Legacy you know how

396
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:51,159
important civil disobedience is I don't

397
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,039
think you're going to be taking the

398
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:55,399
general sort of corporate mentality of

399
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:58,240
like well we have to close all these

400
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:01,440
illegal shops down immediately in order

401
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,480
to for us succeed so how do you face

402
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,639
that

403
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:09,240
challenge I think it's a challenge that

404
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:12,680
we Face globally in the Cannabis

405
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:15,519
industry and the answer and the antidote

406
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:18,479
for that challenge is called education

407
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,919
we've learned that you can't arrest your

408
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,399
way out of these problems we've seen it

409
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:24,799
in the west coast we've seen it in many

410
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:28,198
countries around the world the key is to

411
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:32,278
educate people so I've also been a big

412
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:34,519
advocate for legalization and for legacy

413
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:38,600
being able to participate in the legal

414
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:41,720
market so for example last year um on on

415
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,040
420 we collaborated with local community

416
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,920
board from Harlem with Columbia

417
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:51,000
University and what we realized was that

418
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:53,278
part of the reason that the education

419
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,440
that happens in these room was not being

420
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:58,439
spread out to a more a more larger

421
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:01,120
audience was because geographically in

422
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,319
New York York the biggest conferences

423
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,599
similar to this were you know in the

424
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:08,199
most affluent areas like 96 to Wall

425
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,480
Street for whoever is from has been to

426
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:13,679
mahad nose which is like where the you

427
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,160
know the Upper Crust is and we were like

428
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,120
we can't complain and think that the

429
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,720
government are going to solve these

430
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,198
problems so we got to do what we can

431
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,919
with the platform that we have so we

432
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,199
partnered with the community board with

433
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:28,480
Columbia University we brought in some

434
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:31,320
politicians to educate people on the

435
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,679
economic benefits the legal rific of how

436
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:38,200
they can cross over fleu in a a doctor

437
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:40,798
Dr Knox on on the endocannabinoid system

438
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,519
to show people and we gave all this for

439
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:45,519
free to the community because people

440
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:47,000
can't possibly understand what's

441
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,038
happening if the information is not

442
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,798
being brought to them we also had

443
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:54,279
translation services for people that did

444
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:56,639
not speak English and only speak Spanish

445
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:58,558
so through these efforts we're going to

446
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,240
continue to educate the community when

447
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:03,319
it comes comes to Legacy we are not fans

448
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,519
of our resting our way out of this

449
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:07,918
problem so what I I plan on being an

450
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,798
example to tell them I was once on a

451
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,559
corner like you I'm no different than

452
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:14,879
you you can do this too and a matter of

453
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,798
fact I would love to Mentor you and

454
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,159
teach you a to z how I made the

455
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:21,279
transition so you can make it too and I

456
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:24,679
think we have to create Bridges instead

457
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:27,759
of Moes to really fully optimize this

458
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:31,080
industry and that's part of our mission

459
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:33,759
and vision is to educate Elevate and

460
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:36,199
show people what's possible from the

461
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:39,519
consumer perspective and from the Legacy

462
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,000
perspective I think the whole like just

463
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,639
like you said just try to arrest away

464
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,359
all these problems has yielded no

465
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,559
results so that's my method of how to

466
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,798
challenge that V I got a I got a

467
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:52,158
question for

468
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:53,918
you I'm going to put on my regulatory

469
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:56,120
hat right now going through the process

470
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,120
in New York to acquire a license what

471
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:00,038
are what are your takeaways and opinions

472
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:02,199
on it you know I'm more of a free market

473
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:03,759
guy that's why I sit on the hemp side I

474
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,080
like to have competition rather than

475
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,599
regulatory barriers to entry and

476
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:12,079
obviously you know talking about Legacy

477
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:13,599
versus um regulated markets I I find it

478
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:14,960
quite fascinating and I know that the

479
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:16,959
New York New York process was

480
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,279
interesting so I'd like to know your

481
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,279
opinion on you know how that process

482
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:24,519
went for you and maybe you tell everyone

483
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:28,399
else you know your thoughts on it well

484
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:31,319
um it was definitely you know uh little

485
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:35,559
mess see and the roll out has been uh

486
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:37,839
not the easiest but in comparison to the

487
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:40,879
rest of the country it is the most

488
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:42,839
Equitable bill in the country because in

489
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,799
other states somebody like myself

490
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:46,480
wouldn't be able to participate in the

491
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:48,400
market because they said if you had a

492
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,360
record if you participated in the Legacy

493
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,000
Market you could not go to the legal

494
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:56,199
market so right now imagine that if you

495
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,519
have experience doing this you're not

496
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:03,519
allowed to do it that is unbelievable to

497
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:05,839
me so New York changed that and now it's

498
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:08,679
you know New York has the mentality of

499
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:12,038
more of mom and pops and small business

500
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:15,880
that's why New York is the first uh

501
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:17,720
state where msos and larger corporations

502
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,120
were the last ones to enter Because New

503
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,600
York is a place where they don't have

504
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:24,678
Walmarts they don't have these big box

505
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:27,000
sort of you know operations so right now

506
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:29,880
there's about 75 open and they're all

507
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,279
owned by marginalized small business

508
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:35,400
people the bigger players are coming now

509
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:38,079
but there's a better chance for it to be

510
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:41,320
more Equitable and more full circle

511
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:43,038
because it's not to the extent that you

512
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:46,480
said Brett way it's like just free

513
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:48,640
market but you have different all

514
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,000
different perspectives in the market

515
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:55,640
from Legacy to small business to larger

516
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,359
company so now it's more of a robust

517
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,799
different option for the consumer it's a

518
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:03,439
different different options for the way

519
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:05,679
you do business New York is also the

520
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,480
only state in the country where you can

521
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,559
smoke cannabis anywhere you could smoke

522
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,079
cigarettes so I think was it perfect it

523
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:15,839
was far from perfect it was definitely

524
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:17,439
uh a challenge to get through but it's

525
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:19,038
still better than what we've seen

526
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,840
throughout the country well I did

527
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,319
appreciate your answer in regards to

528
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:26,480
Legacy and legal you know and in Canada

529
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:29,798
we have extremely it's extremely

530
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,679
regulated it's very very high regulated

531
00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:33,240
and so the companies that are trying to

532
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,440
do it legally you know they're they're

533
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,200
they're putting their money in they're

534
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,519
putting their their lives on the line

535
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,679
and there's a lot of stores that ended

536
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:42,558
up getting upset that the indigenous

537
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,320
cultures came in and were like we're not

538
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:46,319
following your rules we're Sovereign

539
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,079
people and we're going to do it this way

540
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,278
and I really had to help educate some of

541
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:53,399
these stores and saying these are your

542
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:55,759
allies not your comp competition do not

543
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,400
complain and [ __ ] about their abilities

544
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:59,038
because they can advertise and they

545
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,080
don't have milligram

546
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,599
uh uh limits and they can sell as much

547
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:04,639
as they want not just 28 grams because

548
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,558
in my

549
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,679
opinion if the indigenous people can

550
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:11,079
create a system that's more successful

551
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,080
than the system that the government

552
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:16,399
creates they will have to bend the knee

553
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:17,839
to the indigenous way and maybe it will

554
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,960
help all these people that have legal

555
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:22,839
stores in Canada you know like you're

556
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,000
not even allowed to to Market in Canada

557
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:27,278
all of our packaging looks identical so

558
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,519
it's a real sort of it's not necessarily

559
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:31,679
the illegal and legal it's these two

560
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,839
different types of legal and and I like

561
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,880
the idea of what you said about robust

562
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:38,119
the more options and opportunities that

563
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:41,039
are out there and that are being

564
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:43,239
experienced in this cannabis business

565
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:46,000
the more the the quicker we will find

566
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,960
the ones that are a success rather than

567
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,200
the ones that you know regulatory

568
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,640
framework wants us to follow yeah I

569
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,200
think I resonate with that personally

570
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,880
because of the hemp industry is lack

571
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,720
lack of regul uh re lack of regulations

572
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,480
we can advertise my buddy's got his

573
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,600
brand on an ass car for example so I I I

574
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,278
found it quite interesting you know

575
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:07,000
especially as I come to these events and

576
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:09,519
meet more and more folk you know the uh

577
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,558
the complains and qualms can be you know

578
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:13,359
whether it's through uh other means or

579
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:16,119
creative creative means maybe to

580
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,639
marketing and sales I I find that uh

581
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:19,719
fascinating especially on the hemp side

582
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,840
where we can you know make safe and

583
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,679
responsible new molecules that are that

584
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:24,720
are able to be easily distributed and of

585
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,720
course there's always going to be a

586
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,960
fight back with that as we as we all

587
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,519
know but um you know the open you know

588
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,798
my my opinion is the plan should be open

589
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:34,158
to anyone that wants to try it as long

590
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:35,759
as they're over a certain age and we can

591
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,559
talk about the certain age but you know

592
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,038
it's arbitrary it just depends where you

593
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:41,278
are so um you know this is this is

594
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:44,079
medicine at the end of the day and some

595
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:45,880
people use it for fun yeah no absolutely

596
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:47,519
switch gears just a slight bit I wanted

597
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,120
to ask Jonah in regards to you know

598
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,960
building these Brands and the amount of

599
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:53,519
time that it takes to build a brand um

600
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,919
your company went through a pretty major

601
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:59,759
reband Rebrand recently um what what led

602
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,840
you to that decision and you know what

603
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,200
have been some of the pros and cons of

604
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:07,480
making that choice yeah you know when we

605
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,480
started this uh almost 12 years ago I I

606
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,679
just always had envisioned that our

607
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,720
company would be MRX extractors I me

608
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,720
that's what we started with that was you

609
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,038
know Blood Sweat tears just you know

610
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,960
working through the the Cannabis space

611
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:23,798
where you know things change Day by hour

612
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,798
by hour day by day and was real proud of

613
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:28,519
the longevity and the success that we

614
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:30,759
had you know during those years but you

615
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:33,359
know it's there is a natural Evolution

616
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:36,119
like we're not the same company that um

617
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:39,398
we wor 10 years ago and so we really

618
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:43,119
looked at it um for a variety of reasons

619
00:24:39,398 --> 00:24:45,000
um one being the name emx extractors was

620
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:48,439
just synonymous with just like

621
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,159
extractors and we now offer a wide array

622
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,399
of additional equipment offerings and

623
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,640
services we also really wanted to appeal

624
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:56,519
to a global market you know with a name

625
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,799
that we thought would be um accepted

626
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:01,759
kind of worldwide um so that was some of

627
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:04,038
the major reasons one was also just for

628
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:06,798
an anecdotal uh having you name

629
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:09,158
extractors in your bank account name we

630
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:11,000
got kicked out of about 10 Banks um

631
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:13,559
throughout the years in the US and stuff

632
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,240
as well too so it was better to have a

633
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:18,879
name that was maybe a little more

634
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,599
discreet you know as well um but I think

635
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,000
one of the biggest factors was you know

636
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:25,918
we really had to reinvent ourselves

637
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,798
during um during the covid years and we

638
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,759
really brought on some really great team

639
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:31,359
members um some really well-respected

640
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,679
industry people that had a lot of

641
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:35,599
success you know in their companies and

642
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,278
we all kind of came together and we

643
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:41,038
wanted to create a brand company that

644
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:42,480
everyone had ownership in and a culture

645
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:45,319
just where everyone was proud like they

646
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,079
really built it you know together and so

647
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:50,678
we did build off a lot of the Legacy

648
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:53,079
Foundation of MRX but we felt like with

649
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:55,278
actually doing the a new brand that

650
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:57,240
everyone would just really have buy into

651
00:25:55,278 --> 00:26:00,640
and have an ownership and so for us it's

652
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:03,319
been a very very powerful uh thing and

653
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,440
have have no regrets doing that's been

654
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:08,519
very positive I think if if there was a

655
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,720
con from it I think the only con was uh

656
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:11,720
coming out of it I think some people

657
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,640
thought like we were a new company and

658
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,798
so we didn't have you know a lot of the

659
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,720
history or track record from that side

660
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:21,440
but people pretty quickly realize that

661
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,079
we're just it was more of a Rebrand and

662
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,679
we did have the long success of um you

663
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:27,439
know building equipment for 10 years but

664
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,320
he just kind of had to educate people

665
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,640
more um what it was but um yeah really

666
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:35,759
glad we did it overall it was it was a

667
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,919
good thing for us awesome thank you I

668
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:38,000
think we got a couple more minutes

669
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:40,278
before we're going to go to some

670
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,038
audience questions I wanted to ask Jose

671
00:26:40,278 --> 00:26:43,759
what what what's the best strategy and

672
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:45,640
the biggest challenges for incumbent

673
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:48,960
companies to reach a Target customer in

674
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:51,240
this in the actual you know in the yes

675
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,640
Canabis Market H the fif thing like I

676
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,038
told you before is the regulations no we

677
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,440
have to adapt our products to the

678
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:57,960
regulations we have in the different

679
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,519
places depending the product we are

680
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,840
selling no it's not the same sell CBD

681
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:05,599
flour for example than sell product for

682
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:07,839
Strat or nutrients in my case no we have

683
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:11,000
to make Focus also in the advertising

684
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:12,798
the way of communicate our message uh I

685
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,079
think it's very important like I told

686
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:19,558
you before also uh using the new uh

687
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:22,558
media we have like LinkedIn or YouTube

688
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:25,319
um the situation I think is good because

689
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:27,879
we have a big challenge ahead here here

690
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:30,119
in in Europe because the numbers I have

691
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,440
at least we will have more consumers

692
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:35,398
than we have in the European in us for

693
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:38,080
example or in Canada so the market is

694
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:40,158
bigger we have to adapt our sales the

695
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:43,398
companies that already SE and the new

696
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,799
ones they they have to H in my point of

697
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:50,079
view look for synergies with companies

698
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:52,639
that already SE in Europe and uh well uh

699
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:54,720
give a better message that we give in

700
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,519
the in the past we we we gave in the

701
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,480
past no so well the the situation is is

702
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:03,440
Unstoppable a lot of countries are open

703
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:08,038
I think there is a there are a very big

704
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:11,200
possibility uh Greece Portugal Germany

705
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:14,879
ER Morocco they are thinking in make a

706
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,840
pilot to legalize the the cultiv of Bia

707
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,480
train for example the same in South

708
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:21,038
America so well I think we have to make

709
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:24,640
focus in the way of communicate the

710
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:26,679
message uh open the the door to the make

711
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,679
collaborations with other companies and

712
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:31,559
enter with them maybe uh looking for

713
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:34,798
synergies and well I I think that are a

714
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:37,480
big Market no for for us here yeah

715
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:39,599
absolutely um just in the last uh minute

716
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,278
or two here that we have before we'll go

717
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:42,918
to the audience for questions is there

718
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:44,679
anything that any of you want to share

719
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:47,480
with the audience that didn't get asked

720
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:50,159
in questions that you thought might be

721
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,960
fitting for this particular conversation

722
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,000
I wanted to add something to the

723
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:57,399
audience especially us being here in

724
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,558
Spain and Barcelona I want to elude

725
00:28:57,398 --> 00:29:03,158
people to the biggest elephant when it

726
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:06,879
comes to Marketing sales I think you

727
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:10,278
know globally that really has not really

728
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,880
been fully optimized and you know me and

729
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:14,359
my company probably being the biggest

730
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:17,799
Latin owned brand in the east coast is

731
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:20,918
one that we're going to really optimize

732
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:25,278
and I recommend whoever can does the

733
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:28,720
same so the that market is the spanishs

734
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:33,278
speaking Market globally they has not

735
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:35,200
been really many brands in the US or

736
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:38,640
globally that have been able to

737
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:41,278
authentically Market to the

738
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:45,519
Spanish-speaking Market in South America

739
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:48,599
North America Caribbean Europe and Etc

740
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,240
and I believe that the companies that do

741
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:51,918
will end up being some of the biggest

742
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,079
companies in the world because it's like

743
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,519
a sleeping giant that nobody's really

744
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:56,960
talking about but I want to know where

745
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:59,519
they heard it first cuz I'm definitely

746
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,558
going to come for it but I also

747
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,679
recommend if possibly you also look into

748
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:07,558
that because I think that it's going to

749
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:09,559
definitely be really massive well that

750
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:12,119
was a question I had for Jonah yeah

751
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:14,000
excellent excellent uh I was going to

752
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:16,918
ask all of you really the Cannabis

753
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,640
industry is global how do you approach a

754
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:20,640
worldwide Market we'll start with

755
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:26,480
Jonah you know still figuring it out to

756
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:28,000
be honest because this is this is really

757
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,798
our first you know we're in about a year

758
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,038
and a half and and trying different

759
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:34,480
things and I think the most powerful

760
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:39,038
thing and it's one of the things Vlad

761
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:42,278
hit on earlier as well too was just a um

762
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:44,679
a strategic alignment and collaboration

763
00:30:42,278 --> 00:30:47,000
there's so much that goes into getting

764
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:49,440
yourself established in a new a new

765
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,398
territory and a lot of that comes to

766
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,000
like trust especially when you're

767
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:55,439
talking about like high high value

768
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,759
purchases and things like that that

769
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,960
essentially you're you're marrying the

770
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:01,240
company that you're you're buying I mean

771
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,360
you you're buying something from um and

772
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:07,399
so just how it's gone a very long way to

773
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:09,038
align ourselves with um vendors like

774
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:10,879
such as Huber who have like a global

775
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:14,679
presence and they've essentially asked

776
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,440
us to uh you know U um work with them

777
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:20,080
and put equipment you know in in their

778
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:22,200
showrooms and in their um exhibits um

779
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:25,038
then also even stuff just like ICBC here

780
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,278
you know I went to Berlin um Alex was

781
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:28,158
just encouraged me you got to go to

782
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:29,679
Berlin bro you got to go to Berlin and I

783
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,000
went to Berlin and it was the best thing

784
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,759
we could have done um you know met some

785
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,599
great clients but not just clients just

786
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:38,960
uh industry professionals that we've

787
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:40,719
developed relationships with that now

788
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,960
trust us to do what we say we're going

789
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,960
to do and so they feel comfortable

790
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,840

and friends so to me that's been the

792
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:51,079
most valuable thing for us to um get

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,759
into a global market is really

794

many companies or most of the companies

821
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:06,278
that invested in

822
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:10,319
licenses do not know anything about the

823
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:12,480
consumer right so how would a company or

824
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:16,480
then this is this will be in the global

825
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:20,399
market uh connect uh with the final

826
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,599
consumer because if we go back everybody

827
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:26,119
that started smoking or consuming

828
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:29,798
cannabis uh is consuming from the Legacy

829
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:34,079
so it's a different uh transaction of uh

830
00:33:29,798 --> 00:33:36,720
language uh and just overall culture of

831
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:41,638
How It's approached uh how would you

832
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:46,120
recommend a a uh or a license company to

833
00:33:41,638 --> 00:33:49,599
approach or to reach out to the final

834
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:51,359
consumer well that goes back to what

835
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:53,439
we've been talking about here I was

836
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:56,678
talking backstage with some of the some

837
00:33:53,440 --> 00:34:00,080
of the panelists here that cannabis is

838
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:02,120
the scalp in this divided world where

839
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:05,278
everybody believes in so many different

840
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:07,719
things cannabis cuts through all of that

841
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:10,320
but you have to get people in the same

842
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,800
room so you have to create events you

843
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,599
have to create conferences like Alex has

844
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:19,599
here you have to create the incubator

845
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:22,679
where everybody no matter whether their

846
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,760
legacy legal corporate you know

847
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:27,200
background religion race sex doesn't

848
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,480
matter where they feel like well I

849
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:32,078
consume cannabis or I want to be in the

850
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:35,838
Cannabis industry and I can come to this

851
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:39,599
place and get information share ideas

852
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:42,279
and figure out how to collaborate as as

853
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,000
Jonah said I think that that is the way

854
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,079
you do it because you have to meet

855
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,679
people where they are because it's all

856
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,440
amazing that we come here and we all

857
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:53,240
understand this you know complex

858
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,838
cannabis jargon but the regular consumer

859
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:56,239
knows nothing about what we're talking

860
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:59,039
about so you have to meet people where

861
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:02,118
they are you have to create safe spaces

862
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:04,759
for them to gather at and show them that

863
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:07,280
there's benefits in consuming legal

864
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:09,480
cannabits you have to show Legacy that

865
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,800
there's benefits for them to cross over

866
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,639
so you have to meet people where they

867
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,599
are and you have to create incubators

868
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:17,639
like this for people to meet up and get

869
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:20,160
together and you know it's a process but

870
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:22,838
it starts with you and your organization

871
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:25,118
and then you inspire others and Etc and

872
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:26,639
Etc so that's my recommendation I I have

873
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,559
a response to that too we're now in

874
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:31,159
Brazil and and me meico so um we're

875
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:34,039
starting to penetrate some of those

876
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:36,519
those Latin markets and um you know the

877
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:38,358
first answer I'll say is lawyer so

878
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:40,920
there's a lot of lawyers involved in the

879
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:43,279
process and you know a lot of creativity

880
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,358
and you know we we use a lot of science

881
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,960
and chemistry to get around regulations

882
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:49,239
but it's a special blend for us in

883
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,679
international markets being in 29 now 30

884
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:53,439
with Brazil actually we just entered

885
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:55,919
this week um it's a special blend in

886
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,159
between lawyers chemistry science behind

887
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,599
the plant and and getting creat creative

888
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:03,159
so um you know as someone that's not a

889
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:05,440
legacy operator anymore we we've found

890
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:08,519
Creative Solutions to complex problems

891
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,280
that are you know somewhat simple at the

892
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:11,639
same time so we've been able to enter

893
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,720
Mexico and Brazil and we've been in

894
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:16,799
Spain for a long time now so um you know

895
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:19,480
we we've been able to figure it out

896
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,160
creatively with creativeness I guess

897
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,920
it's better word that's not a

898
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:28,039
word awesome any uh other questions from

899
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,039
the audience

900
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:36,960
new maybe all right

901
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:40,039
question um no I had something oh here

902
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:45,119
we go there we go just got to give him

903
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:48,440
time we'll get nervous back to you Brett

904
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,838
um I really appreciate that you said you

905
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,880
backed into your business from looking

906
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:55,960
at what the consumer uh wants and

907
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,720
Upstream from that what their products

908
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:01,880
require I'm wondering as your business

909
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:06,039
now uh gets more visibility scale as you

910
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:09,160
said uh and more uh presence uh what

911
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:14,000
that creativity looks like in terms of

912
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:17,199
uh you threading the needle on

913
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,079
regulations you just you just uh spoke

914
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:21,159
about that but I I could imagine that

915
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:23,200
that becomes a more and more important

916
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:25,318
part of your business focus so could you

917
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,439
comment on that thanks yeah the consumer

918
00:37:25,318 --> 00:37:28,119
gets a little bit more difficult in

919
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,639
international markets but the the first

920
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:32,079
part of the question I'll speak in a a

921
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:34,279
US base is is we've reverse engineered

922
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,519
the plant so we've isolated out all the

923
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,400
cannaboids and made you know a lot of

924
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:41,318
Vapes or gummies specifically we've made

925
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:44,318
a product that's an alternative to um

926
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:46,559
just smoking just THC or th oil for

927
00:37:44,318 --> 00:37:48,239
example you know most Vapes in a

928
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:50,159
medicinal recreational setting are just

929
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:51,879
going to be you know extracted from the

930
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:53,358
plant they're going to be 80% th you

931
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,000
might have a little bit of CBG or a

932
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:58,838
little bit of CBN in them but we've now

933
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,079
started to blend in 25% CBN for example

934
00:37:58,838 --> 00:38:03,559
to give a real in my opinion a real

935
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:05,119
indicia um really you know knock you out

936
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:07,679
or put you to sleep and the same on the

937
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,119
sativa side will put 25% THV in a

938
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:12,879
product or some CBG and it'll be more of

939
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:15,358
a you know socializing high or more of a

940
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,880
energy high so you know as far as the US

941
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:18,358
goes we have a lot more freedom to in

942
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,280
order to blend those products and make

943
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:23,639
those products um you know with 46

944
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:26,040
cannaboids we have companies that do uh

945
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:28,159
eight cannaboid Blends there's a very

946
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:30,480
large MSO that just entered the hemp

947
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:32,078
space on February 12th and their blend

948
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,800
is seven to eight

949
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,079
cannaboids um so you know in the US it's

950
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,760
a little bit easier in Europe it's

951
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,599
harder because there are restrictions we

952
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,119
usually only get the liberty of doing a

953
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,480
couple cannaboids plus our presences

954
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:45,280
isn't as large and we don't have the

955
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,800
manufacturing capabilities due to the

956
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,160
fragmentation you know from you know

957
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,440
every country is different in Europe and

958
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:53,118
every country's different in Latin

959
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,880
America but you know I eventually I

960
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,640
think this will get to a point where you

961
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,400
know again people can tailor their

962
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:00,440
cannaboids to whatever they're really

963
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,639
looking

964
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:06,599
for very interesting

965
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:11,719
oh just a

966
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:11,720
second he's running he's running don't

967
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:18,960
trip try to keep things interesting here

968
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:21,119
what's up Brett Marcus all right

969
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,000
so Europe it seems like there's an

970
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:26,599
affinity for more complex cannaboid

971
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,239
Blends versus US market with all the

972
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:30,760
minors merging here and I know you're

973
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:33,719
the expert Brad on this so how would you

974
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:37,160
guys recommend a brand go about starting

975
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:39,799
to quantify the moods and impacts of

976
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:42,879
these behavioral aspects of these miners

977
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:45,160
all combined together the safety aspects

978
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,240
of them and how ultimately we're going

979
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:48,239
to Market to

980
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:56,599
Consumers this just the last question

981
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:58,079
you can okay um you know the safety I'll

982
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:59,280
start on the safety part because that's

983
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,960
the first thing I always hear in one of

984
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,960
these questions is you know um you know

985
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,880
when making these these compounds and

986
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,280
these uh molecules from the Cannabis

987
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,960
plat there there is solvents and and

988
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:13,599
catalysts involved and and luckily for I

989
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,400
guess the Cannabis industry is a lot of

990
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,400
these products are these same uh

991
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,559
catalysts are used in the production of

992
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,480
vitamins and pharmaceuticals and and

993
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:22,880
even Everyday Food Products so there's a

994
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,960
lot of literature over the last hundred

995
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,680
years we call it green chemistry and the

996
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,880
the chemistry space where it's you know

997
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:29,559
it's easy to make sure that they're

998
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,920
produced saf doesn't mean that you

999
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:33,279
should put them in a garage and make

1000
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:35,039
them um you know as as we talk about eug

1001
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,640
GMP you know I truly believe all these

1002
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:39,559
products should be made in a GP facility

1003
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:41,358
um Colorado is actually requiring it

1004
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:42,599
where that's that's where I'm from so

1005
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:44,480
you know I think everything should be

1006
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:46,000
produced in a you know a food food

1007
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,240
setting these are food products or

1008
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,719
Commodities of food in my opinion and

1009
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:51,919
that's how we treat them personally at

1010
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:53,879
our company um so that's the safety

1011
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:58,480
piece but as far as the the Blends get

1012
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,480
more complex and you're 30 more seconds

1013
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:03,960
as the PLS get more complex in Europe

1014
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,560
you know um again it's it's what is the

1015
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,920
consumer taking and there's also the

1016
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:09,759
regulatory part there's lots of RA

1017
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,800
regulatory coming down on hemp in Europe

1018
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,280
and I I think it is pushing people into

1019
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,760
a certain corner to go of certain

1020
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,000
different cannaboids so there's not a

1021
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,359
serious answer to why they're being

1022
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,519
Blended the way they are besides

1023
00:41:18,358 --> 00:41:23,279
honestly regulations um the regulations

1024
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:26,000
are a lot more stiff over here all right

1025
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,480
thank you guys for being on the panel

1026

and sharing uh your know with the

1027
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,000

1028
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,719
and thank you Alex for putting on

1029
