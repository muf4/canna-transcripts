1
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:09,240
so really happy to be here got a great

2
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:11,460
panelists of uh well quite a few

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,199
Canadians actually on the on the panel

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,940
uh we're gonna go through we don't have

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:16,980
a ton of time but we'll go through some

6
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:19,858
introductions we'll find out what got

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,960
each of these guys into genetics uh and

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,820
then we'll just kind of start a organic

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,400
conversation and see where it takes us

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,719
uh so I guess we'll start with you Manny

11
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,358
if you just want to introduce yourself

12
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:32,159
and maybe uh you know give a little bit

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,539
of a background we don't have a ton of

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,179
time so it's like a couple of minutes

15
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:38,339
two three minutes each

16
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:41,100
um just uh what got you into genetics

17
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,640
and how you ended up on this pathway

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,640
hello

19
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,420
what up

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,399
Canada's in the house I can see so I'm

21
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,679
Manny de Silva I was originally born in

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,558
Portugal my whole dual citizenship as

23
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,058
I'm a Canadian citizen as well my

24
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:00,058
experience started with cannabis when I

25
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:03,780
was about 14 and I started growing when

26
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:05,759
I was about 15 16 and quickly learned

27
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,920
that there was more to this plant than

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,140
just putting a seed in the ground and we

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,420
started experimenting with with

30
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,939
different males and females and it just

31
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,978
became a lifelong passion to be able to

32
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:19,319
see the different Expressions that we

33
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:23,060
could get out of each individual

34
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:25,978
cannabis strain that led me to

35
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:29,478
make transition into the legal Market in

36
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:32,459
in early in 2015 2016

37
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:36,658
owned my own facility which I just sold

38
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:38,339
last year and in the meantime I had met

39
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,659
some wonderful people in Israel and we

40
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,900
started a company out of there called

41
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,180
Green boys and we do import export of

42
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,520
high grade only high grade cannabis out

43
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,680
of Canada to various parts in the world

44
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,780
and we also Supply genetics to various

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,960
facilities well John bless you for that

46
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,820
thank you Dave same question you know a

47
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,978
little introduction and where are you uh

48
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:00,658
how you got into the genetics

49
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:04,500
uh my name is Dave OJ I'm the

50
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:07,380
commissioner for Big League genetics we

51
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,439
've we've been selling genetics across

52
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:13,439
Canada for the past two and a half years

53
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:15,419
um I got my start in uh in cannabis

54
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,878
breeding and genetics uh the first time

55
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:19,738
I ever grew I grew some Panama Red and

56
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:22,259
some blueberry and white widow ended up

57
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:25,020
with a male threw some pollen around and

58
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:27,899
was pretty excited about the outcome

59
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,480
um we final hunt we've got a 20 000

60
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,640
square foot grow that we produce

61
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,439
cannabis for international markets we

62
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,199
actually have some new stuff doing an

63
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:40,620
epic drop here in Germany in in the next

64
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:44,280
few weeks and we sell flower into Israel

65
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,840
and we provide genetics now all over the

66
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,019
world

67
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,659
excellent how about you Steve hello hi

68
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:57,000
guys my name is Steve tan I started

69
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:58,919
growing 26 years ago turn of the century

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,739
um why did I get into it I grew three

71
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:04,799
strains for nearly four years nl5 Hayes

72
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:07,019
Scentsy star UK cheese

73
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,739
um you know I came out of the.com Boom

74
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:12,658
making too much money going into weed

75
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:14,580
and you know since then I've traveled

76
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:16,620
the world you know I enjoyed Marcus's

77
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,420
company you know when he had dreadlocks

78
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,340
in a tent

79
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:24,059
um coming out of Jamaica must have been

80
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,920
what 2001 2002. yeah and you know fast

81
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,658
forward that you know mucked around in

82
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,878
California for three or four years you

83
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:33,120
know played in the Bay Area grew grew in

84
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:34,439
hybrid greenhouses I like greenhouses

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,379
um you know I like the moving ship

86
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:39,060
indoor bores me these days and you know

87
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:41,039
so I kind of catered genetics for

88
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,259
greenhouses I like a lot of the minor

89
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,840
cannabloids you know I like to put

90
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:47,699
flavor on CBD

91
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,378
um you know so I like these little

92
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,959
interesting Niche markets and I think

93
00:03:49,378 --> 00:03:53,518
you know weed should be for everyone and

94
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,519
you know we can all debate about high

95
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,039
THC and all that jazz but I think you

96
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,420
know there are a lot of areas that I

97
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,000
think in two or three years will become

98
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:05,818
more prevalent and you know

99
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,620
um I invite everyone here to you know uh

100
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:09,238
push against the boundaries and you know

101
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,739
release products that your marketing

102
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,680
companies are telling you we can only

103
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:15,840
have these kind of profiles and you know

104
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,759
sensory panels in Canada just started

105
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,379
and I think those things are good and

106
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,839
really understanding your supply chain

107
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:24,060
after genetics Innovation happens after

108
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,799
you have to plant you know Marcus talked

109
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,478
about something about you know rosin and

110
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,460
supply chain with that right unless you

111
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:30,659
can have a code line going straight

112
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:34,138
through and I remember that talk

113
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:36,479
somewhere you can't you can't show the

114
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,340
strength of those genetics and you know

115
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,019
extraction genetics are going to be very

116
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:42,119
different from dry flower genetics

117
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:44,039
equatorial Greenhouse genetics that can

118
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,560
be very different from Canadian Outdoor

119
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,360
so I think I'll just stop there

120
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,040
all right we'll finish off with Jameson

121
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,419
thanks Marcus my name is Jameson

122
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,460
Wellborn I'm managing director of the

123
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:55,620
Banyan Tree

124
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,879
um we work with a lot of Legacy

125
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,860
participants to leverage their

126
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,978
intellectual property mostly through

127
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,300
seeds and and and cuts into newly legal

128
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:04,620
markets

129
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,360
um my relationship with the plant

130
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,759
started a little later at the end of

131
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,560
high school and by University I was

132
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,160
lighting up multiple houses and having a

133
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,019
really good time I was uh an ADHD child

134
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,939
and so when I found cannabis I really

135
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:20,339
found what worked for me and it

136
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:22,560
curtailed my Alcohol and Other Drug

137
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:24,418
consumption and made a major positive

138
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,959
impact in my life and it's something I

139
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:31,319
continued on and after University I kind

140
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:34,859
of came clean with what I was doing for

141
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:36,300
my beer money to my family and what I

142
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,160
wanted to continue doing with the plant

143
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,900
and they quickly put a stop to that so I

144
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,419
worked in the corporate world for about

145
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:44,159
four or five years before seeing the

146
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:47,698
light at the end of the tunnel in Canada

147
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,320
and legalization and started Consulting

148
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:52,080
in the space working with a few publicly

149
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,120
traded companies and then ultimately

150
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,978
helping a few startups get started one

151
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,199
cultivation business one genetic

152
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:59,819
business that's up here beside me before

153
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,939
I decide to go off on my own and start

154
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:06,180
uh start my own business and yeah I've

155
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:09,600
spent more time uh putting my focus and

156
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:12,600
energy into championing the Breeders and

157
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,120
Fino hunters and hashmakers then I have

158
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:18,000
actually done in in in breeding myself

159
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,399
so I really like to think of myself as a

160
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,918
more of an agent that is able to speak

161
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,198
and and bring these talented artists

162
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:26,758
into these newly legal markets and

163
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,780
leverage all the work that they've done

164
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:32,520
in the the quote unquote Grace space

165
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:34,258
so that it brings me to the next

166
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:36,120
question which is great

167
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:38,879
um

168
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,038
the the Legacy market and the market the

169
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,019
the the the history of breeding in

170
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:46,199
cannabis has often been connected to

171
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:48,120
these almost savant-like people who are

172
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,680
spending time with the plant they're

173
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,199
going in and they're checking subtle

174
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,259
nuances in the in the grows whether it's

175
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,580
outdoor Greenhouse uh indoors I'm

176
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:58,020
wondering what you guys all think and

177
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:59,579
I'll give you all the chance to answer

178
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:02,579
this question

179
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:05,758
um how you see breeding moving into the

180
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:09,060
future away from traditional methods uh

181
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,538
and into tissue culture crispr methods

182
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,220
DNA fingerprinting where we can now

183
00:07:11,538 --> 00:07:16,800
identify very easily through tissue

184
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,600
culture and fingerprinting What gene

185
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,520
synthesis are present on the plant

186
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,699
whether they're turned off or turned on

187
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:26,758
and how is this going to help us breed

188
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:29,759
for novel cannabinoids novel volatile

189
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:32,460
organic compounds as we move out of

190
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,379
traditional methodologies and and gain

191
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:37,138
these scientific advantages we can start

192
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:39,120
with you if you like Manny

193
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:41,280
so one of the things that we're starting

194
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,500
to see is the recogna the recognition

195
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,239
between the human and cannabinoid system

196
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,779
and the cannabinoids that are produced

197
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,280
by the plant the outlying area that

198
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:53,038
we're we're missing is the connection

199
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:54,719
between those two not every single

200
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:57,000
strain is going to work for every single

201
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,520
patient and point in case you look at

202
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,259
Charlotte's Web that was an amazing

203
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,719
Discovery for Charlotte but a lot of

204
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:06,840
children that were brought and given the

205
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,280
same the same medicine did not did not

206
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:12,359
do well with it the efficacy wasn't

207
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:15,899
there and so I think through uh breeding

208
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:19,080
and through using things like DNA human

209
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:22,079
DNA we can find that connection and be

210
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:23,758
able to prescribe better medicine for

211
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:27,120
people

212
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,759
thanks Manny Dave

213
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,259
um you know we're with you know we're

214
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,519
not growing in basements and attics

215
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,538
anymore

216
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:35,579
um you know that's why we're Big League

217
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:36,538
genetics is is you know this is this is

218
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,778
the big leagues now we're getting

219
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:42,598
scientists involved uh you know DNA is a

220
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:44,338
factor they're viruses and and all kinds

221
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,320
of uh different things that you need to

222
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:48,720
look out for as it relates to the

223
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,100
commercialization of a strain uh just

224
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,600
because something worked in you know

225
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,860
somebody's backyard or their tent

226
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,839
doesn't mean that you're going to be

227
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,759
able to operate a hundred thousand

228
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,740
square feet of it and put food on

229
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:00,299
families tables and participate in

230
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,659
international Commerce and everything

231
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:05,519
else so more and more science is going

232
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:08,338
to be dedicated to this over the next 10

233
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,200
years marker assisted breeding is

234
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,279
already happening

235
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,560
um and I think it's going to continue

236
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:16,019
that way way

237
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:17,879
thank you Steve Marcus

238
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:20,278
um yeah that that topic I you know I

239
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:22,080
might hijack that topic because um we

240
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:24,778
have a startup and we've already done

241
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,459
two crispr cast 9 edits

242
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:28,980
um we've got these seeds now at the

243
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:30,899
University of Guelph and we've done

244
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,159
knock-ins and Knockouts

245
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:34,080
um I didn't actually realize you were

246
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,539
going to pose a question like that but

247
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,600
um so I'm going to plug our biotech

248
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:42,179
startup called hypercan and we're

249
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,659
working with a molecular biologist who

250
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:47,639
has also developed best of class

251
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:50,399
yeast-based enzymes with improved

252
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,720
cannabinoid synthesis so you know to go

253
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,139
backwards and forwards on the question

254
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,759
Jonathan Page at anandia really did a

255
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:59,338
lot of great work and I think he was

256
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:01,319
based maybe in Berlin I forget but um

257
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:04,680
you know at that stage and you know

258
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:07,440
corporate cannabis definitely knocks

259
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:09,239
good or indeed down because you know to

260
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,220
do good plant r d you're really talking

261
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,778
10 years and the way that corporate

262
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,660
cannabis situation that's happened in

263
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:17,759
Canada has has made me realize that

264
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:20,399
working with universities provides me

265
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:23,278
with a longer more stable pathway so

266
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:26,899
we've taken these seeds which for the

267
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:29,820
record are non-GMO point mutation edits

268
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:32,159
and when we breed these seeds we will be

269
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,600
Crossing these mutation point mutations

270
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,659
and our first knockout is actually

271
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,659
taking THC out so we can produce a plant

272
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:41,039
that is truly no percent THC for markets

273
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:43,199
like the Asian market the Japanese

274
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,838
Market which want to grow cannabloids

275
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,920
but they don't want THC so you know

276
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:53,339
editing and Engineering won't come up in

277
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:55,620
in our space I think you know at least

278
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:57,480
three to five years marker assisted

279
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,459
breeding and pan genomic work is

280
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,320
happening very strongly and I'll plug

281
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,659
you know a great company in Switzerland

282
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,420
called pogene they've done amazing stuff

283
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:09,179
and there are also other companies I

284
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:10,679
believe in Canada and you know many more

285
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:14,338
in different states that are working on

286
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:18,139
these things I think what they have and

287
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:21,540
what we didn't have is they have scale

288
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:24,600
they obviously have signs and to measure

289
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:25,860
minor cannabloids like cbcvs and and

290
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,959
these kind of things you really need

291
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,360
science behind you you know we can't

292
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:32,759
test smoke it we can't use our cpg

293
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,680
values to understand it you know we

294
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:36,059
don't have the ailments you know I

295
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:38,639
couldn't tell you

296
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:39,958
um if a CBD product works I just I just

297
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,259
couldn't tell you

298
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:45,719
um as a user so I think you know science

299
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:47,819
is going to take it I believe in Legacy

300
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,820
I think the cpg the flavor the Louis

301
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,500
Vuitton the Louis XII alcohol I think

302
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,600
that's all going to come from a cpg

303
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,179
value brand and I feel that we'll all be

304
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,680
in that empowerment but I think you know

305
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:59,879
we will have to play with these guys

306
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:01,799
because they are going to build

307
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:03,958
bulletproof plants that appear in

308
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:05,639
resistance viroid resistance but then

309
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:07,559
they'll need our flavor profiles to

310
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,299
layer with it so I think that's where

311
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:11,458
that relationship will be they'll build

312
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:13,439
Powerhouse cars but they'll still need

313
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:16,739
us to put the flavor on it or at least I

314
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,320
help so I think yeah I think that's

315
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:22,019
where we are thank you go ahead Jameson

316
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,820
I think that over the next 10 years

317
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:26,519
there's going to be a clear and

318
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,160
definitive line between artistic

319
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:32,339
breeding and Fino hunting and scientific

320
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:34,740
backed breeding and Fino hunting and the

321
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:39,600
reason I say that is just like tobacco

322
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:41,759
we're seeing uh the actual smoking uh

323
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,519
combustion of tobacco reduced but we're

324
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,200
seeing the vaporization of nicotine pens

325
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,700
and things like that increase we're

326
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,879
going to see that same thing take place

327
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:53,639
over these markets in in every any

328
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:55,078
legalized or unlegalized market and each

329
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,259
market happens to be at a different

330
00:12:55,078 --> 00:13:01,919
point in its Evolution but when you

331
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:04,500
really look at the ability to assign

332
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:07,559
drug identification numbers make medical

333
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,159
applications or

334
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:10,559
um

335
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,179
you're going to see individuals using

336
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,159
crisprin and things that Stephen talked

337
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:15,120
about to separate out different parts of

338
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,338
the plant where you're going to have

339
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,980
certain breeding projects made for

340
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:22,920
specific volatile organic compounds and

341
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:25,320
the THC and CBD that that plant

342
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:27,899
produces are the overall inflorescence

343
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,639
of the plant isn't going to be a vital

344
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:31,679
key factor because that's going to be

345
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:35,339
destined for isolation and extraction

346
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,899
and then those different marker assisted

347
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:39,839
breeding projects where one will be for

348
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:42,139
high THC one will be for CBD one will be

349
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:46,019
for beta carophylline one will be for

350
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:47,879
valancine will all be utilized on mass

351
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,139
and extracted and when you're not

352
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:52,679
looking for

353
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:54,000
the optimal concert of all of the

354
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:56,219
different characteristics that you're

355
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,958
looking for that we see in artistic Fino

356
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,500
hunting and breeding where the plant

357
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:05,399
needs to hit hard taste good be powdery

358
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:08,639
uh powdery mildew and mold resistant and

359
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:11,220
you know resistant to to drops in cold

360
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,680
temperatures those factors won't have to

361
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,600
all line up when you're only focusing on

362
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,759
one characteristic and I think that will

363
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,040
be isolated to the medical side where

364
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,019
extraction focused drug identification

365
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:24,659
numbers are being sought after and that

366
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:27,360
will likely be the larger portion of the

367
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:28,819
market and then the Craft

368
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,980
um you know

369
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:34,260
uh artisanal side is going to still

370
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,820
remain with the Fino Hunters who are

371
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:36,778
looking for that overall experience in

372
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,220
that plant

373
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:40,620
yeah I definitely don't think you're

374
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,778
wrong I see in these pharmaceutical

375
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,919
markets that they want to stabilize and

376
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:45,600
I'm

377
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,519
I mean they're scientists so they have

378
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,980
to understand that stabilizing volatile

379
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,379
organic compounds

380
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:55,500
is impossible

381
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:57,299
you can't you can't do it so this is

382
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,679
what Jameson's saying you've got one

383
00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:00,240
group who are like let's stabilize it

384
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:02,638
well how do you stabilize it you short

385
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,039
path molecularly distill it you reduce

386
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,899
all of the volatile compounds out of it

387
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:09,000
and then you're left with cannabinoids

388
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:11,399
oh look it's stable yeah but now it's

389
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,379
boring it no longer has those volatile

390
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:16,679
organic compounds but it does fit into

391
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:19,799
the pathways that are this sort of this

392
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:21,599
medical pharmaceutical pathway

393
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:23,458
um I also wanted to talk to you guys a

394
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,440
little bit about the importance of

395
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:27,539
tissue culture all of the clonally

396
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,540
produced plants on the planet currently

397
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:32,278
being clonally produced are done through

398
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:33,899
tissue culture cannabis is one of the

399
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:36,299
only plants that's not done through

400
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:39,600
tissue culture so the question I wanted

401
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:40,979
to pose to each of you as as breeders

402
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,899
that are producing genetics are

403
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,399
representing these Artesian breeders

404
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:47,399
that are you're selling their genetics

405
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,078
how important is it for you guys to

406
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:51,539
understand because

407
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:53,819
if you give someone a plant that is

408
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:56,338
completely impregnated with viruses and

409
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,959
bacteria and fungi and they go and try

410
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:00,300
to grow this genetic it doesn't matter

411
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:02,099
how good of a grower they are they're

412
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:05,338
not going to be able to get the plant to

413
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,899
express itself the way it should often

414
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,600
in the industry

415
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:11,759
this looks bad on the breeder instead of

416
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,800
the grower who's and it's not even the

417
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,240
Grower's fault in that sense so how

418
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:17,698
important do you guys think it's going

419
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,698
to be to have your genetics initiated

420
00:16:17,698 --> 00:16:24,240
through tissue culture to have any type

421
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:27,359
of anything bacteria fungi viruses

422
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,639
removed from the plant before it goes

423
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,199
into production do any of you guys think

424
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,720
of that

425
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,458
uh yeah tissue cultures immensely

426
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,399
important

427
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:40,379
um it's uh it's not a silver bullet uh

428
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,839
but it's absolutely especially with

429
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:44,820
Germany and European markets and and

430
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,320
international markets operating all over

431
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,420
the world

432
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,839
um just like Marcus said you know if

433
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:55,379
you've got viruses you've got problems

434
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,300
um seeds aren't necessarily safe and so

435
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:58,439
we have a tissue culture lab for Big

436
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:00,659
League

437
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,940
um I'm sure others of you up here also

438
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:06,178
working with tissue culture

439
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,980
um it's definitely a very useful tool in

440
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:11,400
the toolbox to be able to make sure that

441
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,419
you've got stuff stored in vitro that is

442
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,179
safe

443
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:17,699
we do a lot of heat pheno hunting at our

444
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:20,220
facility and so we will run

445
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:22,259
um large populations of different types

446
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,539
of seeds that you know we don't know

447
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:27,179
what might have been you know what might

448
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:28,259
be contracted and and uh and so you want

449
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,419
to make sure that you know when you're

450
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:32,400
starting a new facility or taking in

451
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:34,919
genetics from somewhere else that's been

452
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,840
tested that it's safe or at least as

453
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,640
safe as you can be and then making sure

454
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:40,139
that you've got the the fail safes in

455
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,520
place to you know to be able to take

456
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,500
care of yourself

457
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,259
yeah I mean I completely agree with Dave

458
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:49,140
like when you're when you're selling

459
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:52,558
um you know Championship racing horses

460
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,360
or or race you know Premier breeding

461
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:56,279
dogs they need to come with their hip

462
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:58,139
shot and all the test results and you

463
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:59,700
know that's really what this is bringing

464
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,559
this into a

465
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,538
um a time where

466
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:05,399
you know all the teas need to be crossed

467
00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:07,679
knives need to be dotted and when you're

468
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,380
realizing the value and having and the

469
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,360
time that we save these cultivators

470
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,039
um through these Fino hunting processes

471
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:16,619
you know a lot of these cultivators I

472
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:18,660
know we saw it in Canada where they

473
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:19,739
would raise a bunch of money they'd make

474
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,960
a bunch of promises to their

475
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,000
shareholders and then they'd say you

476
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,919
know we've got a bunch of seats and

477
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,900
we're gonna hit the ground running and

478
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,320
we're gonna have a crop ready in four

479
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:33,480
months for you guys and then the c-suite

480
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:35,279
learns about this Fino hunting process

481
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,519
and The Growers at the board table

482
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:40,379
trying to explain what Fino hunting is

483
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:42,298
and he's going okay if you and your wife

484
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,220
have a hundred kids they're going to be

485
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:46,379
short and tall and fat and wide and

486
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,380
skinny and smart and stupid and we've

487
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,419
got to find the LeBron James of your

488
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,640
kids and that's and that's what female

489
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:55,500
hunting is and and

490
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,240
um that can take eight months or 12

491
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,759
months or 16 months you know depending

492
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,558
on how lucky you are and so I think

493
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,980
there's a tremendous amount of value

494
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:07,440
that you know us as genetic providers

495
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,880
add that sometimes is a hard-earned

496
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,320
lesson for newly created companies and

497
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,000
c-suites that aren't as much educated on

498
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,740
that process and with that

499
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,380
responsibility and with the price that

500
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:21,900
you know is demanded needs to come

501
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,280
proper testing so I mean tissue culture

502
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,960
is just the start there's a lot of other

503
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,480
stuff that needs to be done and provided

504
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,220
whether you're doing nodal tissue

505
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,480
culture or meristem tissue culture you

506
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,279
know you need to educate yourself on

507
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,960
that process and you know where it's

508
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:36,119
coming from and all the tests you need I

509
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,500
mean hop latent is what's on the tip of

510
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:39,959
everyone's tongue but there's tobacco

511
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,119
Mosaic there's there's a a list of other

512
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,100
lettuce chlorosis there's there's a list

513
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:46,319
of other tests that need to be performed

514
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:47,699
to really feel confident

515
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,319
um in in the genetics that you're

516
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,179
bringing into your facility and even

517
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:52,740
when you have all those things you need

518
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:54,298
to have a quarantine program in place

519
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,759
before those genetics go into

520
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:59,099
commercialization

521
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:01,079
just to elaborate a little bit on what

522
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:03,899
Marcus was saying about you know good

523
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:06,240
genetics and uh and and Growers a lot of

524
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,980
times the growers in these companies get

525
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,620
a very bad rep because they have a bad

526
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:13,558
genetic and a good grower uh you know

527
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:15,599
can uh can be brought down by a terrible

528
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:17,879
genetic just like a terrible grower can

529
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,980
be brought up by a good genetic the

530
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,840
other thing that that's important is

531
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,000
that a lot of people think that you can

532
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,798
just get a genetic and start growing and

533
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,599
it's going to be wonderful I've learned

534
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:29,819
over time that it takes roughly eight

535
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,759
turns of any single genetic to be able

536
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:34,019
to have a a good understanding of that

537
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:36,179
plant and how it's going to express

538
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:37,859
itself and what it likes what it doesn't

539
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:40,200
like what temperatures you can take it

540
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:41,939
to so there's there's a lot more to this

541
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,980
for me

542
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,500
um I think it's it's somewhat

543
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:49,319
disappointing that the industry has such

544
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:52,019
a low value for genetics they all

545
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:54,240
believe that uh you know they should be

546
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:56,759
able to pay next to nothing for them yet

547
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,919
genetics are what these companies are

548
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:01,500
making their money off of if they don't

549
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:03,538
have good genetics that produce good

550
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,220
quality flour how can you expect to sell

551
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:07,079
it

552
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,660
and I think you know to pick up on that

553
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:11,639
yeah I mean you know I have a slide and

554
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,340
you know Microsoft invests you know 10

555
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,038
to 12 15 on r d

556
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:18,599
uh you know when I talk to Big LPS and

557
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:20,099
you know I sit them down I'm saying like

558
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:22,199
you guys need to invest two and a half

559
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:23,879
to five percent of your revenue on your

560
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,140
Innovation on your plants on your

561
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,360
genetics whether you want to run your

562
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,520
own programs do your own feminizing you

563
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,439
know do it in-house have a good guy you

564
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:32,759
know has a good background yeah there's

565
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,860
a lot of people that are doing that

566
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:37,379
whether you want to you know go to the

567
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:39,599
market pick the latest Kali hype strains

568
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,580
that's all good but you know the focus

569
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:44,359
markers on tissue culture the reason why

570
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:46,740
cannabis hasn't turned into bananas

571
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:48,658
which and everything else it's actually

572
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,460
quite easy to maintain mothers if you

573
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:53,039
know what you're doing yes the disease

574
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:55,740
element is there yes biobanking has an

575
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:58,558
advantage but if you try and send a

576
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:01,140
thousand TC cuts across the border at

577
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:02,940
the moment it's a nightmare so you know

578
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:05,159
we send fresh cuttings we put fresh

579
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,919
cuttings in a bag and we send them and

580
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:09,600
and that's worked great so you know the

581
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,000
history of tissue culture is trying to

582
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,099
fit a triangle into a square and you

583
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,558
know cannabis is very different so the

584
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:19,319
reason reasons why we don't use tissue

585
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:22,019
culture is you know banana and durian

586
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:24,058
and a lot of other bamboo propagation is

587
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:26,220
a lot harder you know these plants root

588
00:22:24,058 --> 00:22:28,678
in six to ten days and they're pretty

589
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,839
bulletproof and you know hot blades and

590
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,820
viroid and some of these stuff I know

591
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:35,099
guys that put that into their TC room

592
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:37,259
because that's such a mess on its own so

593
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:39,000
just because you have TC doesn't mean

594
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:41,220
you know you're going to avoid diseases

595
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,380
it's more about your Baker who does it

596
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:46,380
how they do it and you know your

597
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:48,080
formulations between different strains

598
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:51,059
um and you know all of that kind of jazz

599
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:54,178
yeah well after coming out of about 100

600
00:22:51,058 --> 00:22:56,279
Years of cannabis prohibition and all

601
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:59,460
living under the mentality of how much

602
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:02,220
can I get and how fast can I get it I.E

603
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:04,980
flowering times and vegetative growth

604
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:07,319
how much does it affect you guys in your

605
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,779
breeding of your genetics now that

606
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:11,519
people seem to be more understanding and

607
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:13,379
interested in the production of

608
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,000
cannabinoids and volatile organic

609
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:18,659
compounds which don't necessarily

610
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,279
correlate to vegetative yields finishing

611
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:22,280
in seven to eight weeks

612
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,659
don't understand the question so you

613
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:29,579
know if you want to look at some

614
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:31,980
companies you can value their output by

615
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:35,220
pure cannabilite output so rather than

616
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,720
biomass so to start there you know as we

617
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,179
know extraction plants have slightly

618
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,759
more open profiles you know your oil per

619
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:43,320
kilo ratio you know your value chain is

620
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:45,538
to your extractor so if you draw

621
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:47,700
extraction strains you add a value chain

622
00:23:45,538 --> 00:23:50,099
to them if you grow dry flower strains

623
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:52,319
then that's that if you look at your

624
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:54,959
whole plant as a total cannabloid output

625
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:57,359
and you value that as pre-roll trim dry

626
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,659
flour and you take that type of strategy

627
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:03,058
then you you start to understand and

628
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:04,380
don't do what you know and I and I lived

629
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:06,119
in Canada for the last few years don't

630
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,320
do what the Canadians do which is oh

631
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:08,759
yeah we're just going to make a hash

632
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:12,119
line from the trim off the greenhouse

633
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:14,339
and you know that's Canadian yeah yeah

634
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:15,959
and you you we we all know the first

635
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:18,178
hash products that came out weren't

636
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,759
weren't built for that and you know hash

637
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:23,220
plants actually don't do well indoors

638
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,900
because of their Leaf to Bud ratio and

639
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,240
you know so you're going to see

640
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,159
different environments in different

641
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,359
markets being operated four different

642
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:34,740
segments because it's clearly you know

643
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:36,658
and we're we're building good Auto

644
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,759
flowers you know California who hated

645
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:40,140
feminized seeds who hated Auto flowers

646
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,779
you know now they're making a lot of

647
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,880
autoflowers field extraction you know

648
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:46,558
some of the emerald Cup winners are now

649
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,120
being turned into autoflowers are here

650
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,759
and you know people are trying to run

651
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:53,158
these so you're trying to get an acre of

652
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:55,379
you know cannabinoid output so calculate

653
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:57,179
your stuff not on biomass because that's

654
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,100
not really where you're gonna win you're

655
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:00,840
gonna win on quality cannabloids or

656
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:03,000
volatiles depending on the market you

657
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:04,918
want so put that into your business

658
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,538
plans figure that out and that works a

659
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,919
lot better I think you know getting you

660
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:09,839
somewhere

661
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,059
add to that

662
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,819
um depending on your customer like I

663
00:25:12,058 --> 00:25:17,700
mean at least for us the customer's

664
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:19,139
desire and outcome is really you know

665
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,240
kind of where we start the genetic

666
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:23,159
conversation there's certainly

667
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,679
um you know I don't know how many times

668
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:28,380
today I got asked if we have high THC uh

669
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,000
if we got high THC strains

670
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,880
um so that that's obviously the first

671
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,058
and foremost on anybody's mind

672
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,460
um you know we try to look after our

673
00:25:36,058 --> 00:25:40,019
customer and their goal uh for what

674
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:43,140
they're trying to achieve a lot of our

675
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:45,058
customers right now are on uh are

676
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,100
selling dry flour

677
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:48,960
um and and that's what they want and so

678
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:50,879
you know it sometimes that's where it

679
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,200
ends up for extraction but a lot of

680
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,760
times it's you know this is what they're

681
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,120
looking for so

682
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:59,099
um yield and and potency is still you

683
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,619
know it's it's what on the front of

684
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:03,240
everybody's mind right now Pi THC opens

685
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:05,219
the door whether whether you move the

686
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,500
conversation forward or not and then you

687
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,839
can really dependent on the company's

688
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,900
structure and how the how they make

689
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:15,178
their decisions the overall yield the

690
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,460
flower time and the amount of volatile

691
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:18,659
organic compounds all play a role in in

692
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,538
a different order for different

693
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:23,400
companies and so there's a

694
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:25,519
situation that we're facing right now

695
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:28,860
where

696
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:31,679
the uneducated and uninitiated want to

697
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:33,899
assign a value to a percentage and and

698
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,580
that's how they're able to achieve sales

699
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,940
volumes and that's how they're able to

700
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:42,298
communicate value to the end Sellers and

701
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:45,298
users and so even though most of us up

702
00:26:42,298 --> 00:26:47,759
here have had 18 cannabis that is far

703
00:26:45,298 --> 00:26:50,278
outdone any 35 cannabis that we've

704
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:55,500
smoked uh that's not the reality right

705
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:57,359
now and so having a threshold of a THC a

706
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,159
number that is going to get the

707
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,319
conversation started and then you can

708
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,760
start looking at okay well this one is

709
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:05,819
finishes in eight weeks and this one

710
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:07,500
finishes in six but the six weeker

711
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:10,139
doesn't yield as much grams per square

712
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,298
foot as the eight weaker and is a little

713
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,860
bit less powdery mildew resistant and

714
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:15,418
we're dealing with powdery mildew in our

715
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:17,459
facility so you have to weigh all these

716
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:19,559
variables and work with your your

717
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,720
cultivators and your clients to find the

718
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:23,819
right fit for that genetic so I really

719
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,919
think that cannabinoids opens the door

720
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:27,778
to the conversation and it's a it's a

721
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,278
full stopper start you can't go okay

722
00:27:27,778 --> 00:27:31,919
I've got something that finishes in six

723
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:34,319
weeks yields great per square foot but

724
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,179
it's only 18 they're going to say we

725
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,278
don't care it you know it could be the

726
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:40,140
greatest thing since sliced bread we're

727
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:43,740
not going to look at it but once you get

728
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:45,360
over that 25 26 threshold then other

729
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,058
characteristics and factors start being

730
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:50,939
put in play

731
00:27:48,058 --> 00:27:52,259
so just to go back on the whole THC

732
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,320
thing it's something that I don't think

733
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:58,319
we talk about enough I think it's a real

734
00:27:55,319 --> 00:28:00,599
misnomer that we use THC as the

735
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:03,839
barometer for quality in cannabis we're

736
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:06,359
trying to equate THC in the same way

737
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:08,579
that they do with alcohol the problem is

738
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:11,579
with a bottle of alcohol if it says it's

739
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:13,319
40 it is from the top to the very bottom

740
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:16,879
you can't have that with cannabis you

741
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:19,259
have a thousand plants with 30 40

742
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,659
colas on it they're not all going to be

743
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:23,900
the same you know and it's unfortunate

744
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:26,760
that this industry has

745
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,798
been so pigeonholed in how we present

746
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:30,960
cannabis to the customer like in the

747
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:33,658
days when we were doing it we were doing

748
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,220
packs you basically opened up a bag you

749
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:37,080
liked how it looked you liked how it

750
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,759
smelled and that's the reason why you

751
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:41,519
bought it today the consumers all they

752
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:44,819
have is a number to go by and it's it's

753
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,619
terrible way to represent cannabis

754
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:48,599
well it leads me to our last question

755
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:50,759
because I believe we are close to the

756
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:52,500
end and guile another four or five

757
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:54,419
minutes so this will be a perfect

758
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,679
question for you guys each of you to

759
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:58,380
answer

760
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:01,200
in your perfect world in your utopian

761
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:03,480
cannabis breeding world how does the

762
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,940
future look

763
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,919
I think the future looks really good

764
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,440
because we are making some really big

765
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,360
steps in cannabis breeding you know with

766
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,759
the science base that we have now and

767
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:17,339
the Legacy uh ways that we did things

768
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:19,259
it's it's starting to come together and

769
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:21,418
I think that in future we're going to be

770
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:22,940
able to develop genetics that are going

771
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:25,320
to be able to Target

772
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,778
a certain cannabinoids and certain

773
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:30,058
profiles even better than we do today so

774
00:29:27,778 --> 00:29:32,940
I think it's a it's a bright future on

775
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:34,918
the on the genetic side

776
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,480
go ahead I think it's

777
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:38,700
you know

778
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,380
I think it's good and bad

779
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,919
um I think that there's a a bright

780
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:45,899
future and a lot of exciting things

781
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,480
um with genetics and and still yet to be

782
00:29:45,898 --> 00:29:50,819
discovered and explored

783
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,440
um I'm kind of an old Bean Head and I've

784
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:54,720
been collecting seeds for a really long

785
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,058
time I like

786
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,519
um new stuff and I I like the old stuff

787
00:29:57,058 --> 00:30:01,319
and I'm you know with with new countries

788
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,679
coming online if we're pulling out of

789
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:06,480
genetic Banks from from Canada the the

790
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:08,278
population that we get to pull from is

791
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,140
going to get smaller and smaller there

792
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:12,240
will be breeding projects that expand on

793
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,038
that but there will be stuff that's

794
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,500
truly lost

795
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:19,079
um and you know as a I guess a bit of a

796
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:21,179
preservationist yeah land race

797
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:24,000
preservation and and stuff that's just

798
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:26,340
old like Thailand is is uh you know gone

799
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,038
through legalization right now a lot of

800
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:30,599
Cali genetics are over there and there's

801
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:31,679
an impact to that

802
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:33,719
um you know there's going to be cross

803
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:37,140
breeding that's going to happen in pure

804
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,899
Thai land races are are going that that

805
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:41,580
that genetic bubble has now been

806
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:43,619
penetrated and so there will be less

807
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:45,418
things like that and for me me I guess

808
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:47,879
that's a little bit sad

809
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:49,980
um but uh yeah the future is definitely

810
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,500
exciting you know marker assisted

811
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:54,720
breeding towards you know going after a

812
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:58,019
certain potency or a certain cannabinoid

813
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,120
or or terpene value effect

814
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:02,220
um all of that's very exciting stuff but

815
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:03,898
I guess the you know the old Bean Head

816
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,399
it means still like uh you know I'd like

817
00:31:03,898 --> 00:31:07,558
to pop some old Urban Poison and see

818
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:10,319
what we find

819
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:12,178
well it started optimistic it went

820
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:14,339
medium I'm not sure if I could go

821
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:16,140
downhill or uphill on the future of

822
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:18,000
cannabis genetics I could say you know

823
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,559
half of us might not be here in three to

824
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,599
five years

825
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:25,079
um I think you know I'll touch on Dave's

826
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:28,500
optimism you know it's so cool uh you

827
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:30,418
know at my age 46 to come in and have

828
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,700
all these tools and to be able to go

829
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:34,380
back into my old seed bank and open it

830
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,899
up pull it out turn it left right center

831
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,340
get support have stuff that I'm not

832
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:40,739
worried about the door getting knocked

833
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:42,959
down and losing that [ __ ] you know today

834
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,519
if you collect winning resources you

835
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,740
should be able to hold on to them we

836
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:49,200
never had that privilege and I think

837
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,700
that's that's amazing

838
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,038
um I think the future is going to split

839
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,500
like the Artesian corporate and I think

840
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,759
that's that's inevitable

841
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,960
um and I think you know DNA

842
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:59,220
fingerprinting and all these things are

843
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,960
going to give the small guy a little bit

844
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,700
more tools I think the pressure will be

845
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,880
on maintaining facilities maintaining

846
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,080
biobanks I think good relationships

847
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,720
exclusive relationships will become

848
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:11,220
stronger as things close down you know

849
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,220
as the market matures

850
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,839
um and you know yeah

851
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:18,179
I think it's going to be more science

852
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:19,500
and less art I think if you take all the

853
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:21,720
colors of the rainbow and mix them

854
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,038
together you end up with brown

855
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,798
um we're dealing with a lot of just

856
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:27,778
polies on polies on Pollies and you know

857
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:29,278
the names are the only things that

858
00:32:27,778 --> 00:32:31,079
differentiate these things and if you

859
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:32,398
open up a large enough population you're

860
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:34,558
going to find everything that you were

861
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:37,798
looking for in your other packs in one

862
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:39,658
pack and so I think that unfortunately

863
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:40,918
like Dave said the bubble has been

864
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:42,539
popped

865
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:45,059
um you know I've spent a lot of time in

866
00:32:42,538 --> 00:32:48,179
the Caribbean and you can see

867
00:32:45,058 --> 00:32:51,778
Auto flowers and you can see wide Leaf

868
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:53,278
uh you know different Expressions that

869
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:56,038
have been brought into the country to

870
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:59,099
help the the Cannabis population but

871
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:01,019
really it's it's it's heard it and so I

872
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:04,759
think that as we move to a more

873
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:08,460
scientific and cannabinoid

874
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:12,298
value-based World we're moving away from

875
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:14,940
the magic of selecting based off

876
00:33:12,298 --> 00:33:17,278
experience and I really think that

877
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,840
that's sad but I think it's the reality

878
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:20,640
that we're heading towards and until

879
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:23,398
there's going to be some type of

880
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,620
Renaissance that we saw in alcohol very

881
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:27,778
similar to you know a hundred years of

882
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:30,058
six different beers in Canada those

883
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:32,038
those were what you had to pick from and

884
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:33,960
then eventually there's this Renaissance

885
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:36,480
of beautiful craft beers coming to

886
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,919
Market and that's when individuals like

887
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,140
guys on this panel who've been holding

888
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:43,799
on to beans for a long time are able to

889
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:45,480
bring them forward and and find Value in

890
00:33:43,798 --> 00:33:47,940
a market that currently does doesn't

891
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,679
denote value for those quality markers

892
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,058
and characteristics so I think it's

893
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,399
going to get dark and then it might get

894
00:33:51,058 --> 00:33:55,798
a little light well I have a utopian

895
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:58,619
view of cannabis and the way I see it is

896
00:33:55,798 --> 00:34:00,898
once the regulatory once we have to stop

897
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:03,599
promoting the lie that is you need to

898
00:34:00,898 --> 00:34:07,199
protect children from Cannabis once the

899
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:10,440
regulatory dissipates and and and you

900
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,780
know is removed massively I look forward

901
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,480
to personally because for me genetics

902
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:17,760
are nothing without the Appalachia and

903
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,320
the terroir to allow those genetics to

904
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,720
express themselves and I look forward to

905
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:24,899
the day where I can purchase Lebanese

906
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:28,019
hash in uh Canada and I say that all the

907
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:29,338
time yes of course I want to taste I

908
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:31,079
want to taste the Appalachian you can

909
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:32,759
buy French wine yeah you could buy

910
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:34,378
Australian wine and you'd pay a lot of

911
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,940
money for it right we'll pay a lot of

912
00:34:34,378 --> 00:34:37,378
money for it wouldn't you I would I

913
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,460
would pay a lot I would pay a lot of

914
00:34:37,378 --> 00:34:42,960
them only hash in San Francisco

915
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:45,000
we may find that there are appellations

916
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,159
and terroirs that we have never taste

917
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,019
did because they were so prohibited they

918
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:51,539
weren't Afghanistan or Morocco or

919
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:53,519
Himachal Pradesh Parvati Valley Nepal

920
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:55,858
all of these hash producing countries

921
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,659
there may be countries that come up and

922
00:34:55,858 --> 00:34:58,440
surprise us and when you say things are

923
00:34:57,659 --> 00:35:00,838
lost

924
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,639
things can also be found so we're going

925
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:05,338
to end it on that note

926
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:07,699
that was fantastic what a way to end the

927
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:07,699
conference
