Observatory for medic cannabis

40
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:05,758

00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,719
someone who

50
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,759
knows everything how is the situation

51
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,199
about medical cannabis in in Spain is Je

52
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:39,840
so I don't know it would be a good

53
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:43,280
question to start um talking about

54
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,560
what's going on with the European uh

55
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,400
catalog products let us know what

56
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,439
happened with harmonization what's

57
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,840
what's going

58
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:53,079
on well the thing that's going on in

59
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,719
Spain is that we are going through the

60
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,800
regulation process right now we have a

61
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:00,719
new minister of Health called Monica

62
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:04,519
Aria we have a meeting with the Minister

63
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:06,560
uh two week 3 weeks ago with them and uh

64
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,319
now they're creating the program in

65
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,878
Spain that is going to be available for

66
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:14,359
patients so these few months that is

67
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:17,518
going to come are really important for

68
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,159
us because what is going to be decided

69
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,879
it's going to be what the patients will

70
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:25,039
receive in Spain so it's a huge huge

71
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,318
burden it's a huge

72
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,878
responsibility and also we are fighting

73
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:32,878
against

74
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:35,079
powers that are really big as the

75
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,798
Physicians they don't agree with uh

76
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,560
prescribing medical cannabis we don't

77
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,959
have much support from them like the

78
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,920
government they don't want to do it so

79
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,759
we are like trying to push and push and

80
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:50,280
push and push and now we have they they

81
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:52,399
give us something they give us some

82
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,039
proposals but now we want to improve

83
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,640
them like for example the use of the

84
00:03:54,039 --> 00:04:00,639
flower vaporizing for patients is a need

85
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:03,639
they say is not so so

86
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:07,119
it's so we are trying to change this we

87
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:09,878
we have this hard work to do in the past

88
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,879
in the in the next few months it's it's

89
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:17,079
too much yeah I hope something change

90
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:22,560
soon because it doesn't make any any

91
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:25,879
sense um Chloe by comparation can you

92
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,399
please um tell us how is the the medical

93
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:32,279
cannabis Market in the in the USA

94
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:35,839
overview sure sure so there's a lot

95
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:38,758
going on in the US um and kind of like

96
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,638
in Europe um like each country is

97
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,280
different in terms of their cannabis

98
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,560
policy each state is different in terms

99
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:48,839
of its cannabis policy in the US um I

100
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,399
think just at a high level you can think

101
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:56,560
of three different big categories of

102
00:04:52,399 --> 00:05:00,719
different medical markets um one is the

103
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:04,639
low THC Medical Market so a few examples

104
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:08,000
would be Texas Georgia um they tend to

105
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,519
be more conservative States uh and in

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:17,120
these markets there's typically a limit

107
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:19,959
on THC anywhere from 3% THC to 5% THC

108
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,360
there's really a huge restriction on

109
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:24,918
different product

110
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:30,280
forms um usually no smoking or vaping

111
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:31,959
like Cara was saying um and uh in these

112
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:35,638
markets there's often a lot of

113
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:37,959
competition from hemp products so

114
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,600
there's a lot of there's a lot needed in

115
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:44,120
terms of patient education in terms of

116
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:46,080
the safety profiles of regulated versus

117
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,439
semi-regulated

118
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,839
products um so yeah it's it's an

119
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,038
interesting place to be but I think a

120
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:58,159
lot of companies see it kind of as a

121
00:05:54,038 --> 00:06:01,038
long-term investment play um and then a

122
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,759
second category would be medical markets

123
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:04,079
and there's a lot of subcategories

124
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,919
within medical

125
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:11,120
markets um they differ immensely in

126
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:14,560
terms of patient qualifying conditions

127
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,399
what product forms are allowed um some

128
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,639
require uh pharmacist involvement at the

129
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,239
point of

130
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:25,000
dispensation um the licensing structure

131
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,639
differs a lot from state to state

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,079
depending on which kind of Medical

133
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:33,079
Market it is so there's a lot of

134
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:36,959
within that group and then uh finally

135
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:39,560
the last kind of Medical Market would be

136
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:42,560
a hybrid market so that's where there's

137
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:46,319
both medical and adult use cannabis

138
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,959
allowed um and in those markets I think

139
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,360
from a patients perspective one of the

140
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:55,239
things I find interesting is that some

141
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,319
states put um put restrictions in place

142
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:01,000
or requirements in place to ensure that

143
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,639
businesses continue to really give a

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,598
good quality of service to patients so

145
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:10,280
there can be inventory set asides for

146
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:13,519
patients um as well as Expediting

147
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:16,478
patient access at the point of

148
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:19,719
dispensation um so yeah those are just a

149
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:22,598
few of the differences uh lots lots to

150
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,240
unpack within the us thank you so much

151
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:27,918
Chloe we will talk uh after what do you

152
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:32,560
think is going to be the the future but

153
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:36,079
less um start with beona and talking

154
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:39,160
about um Spain beona because that's

155
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,399
your expectation well that's what you do

156
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,919
that's what you do that's what you want

157
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,758
to do that what you do every single day

158
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:47,560
uh and you're amazing doing your work

159
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:50,598
too so please let us know

160
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,759
um which kind of requirements would we

161
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:55,959
need to get a medical cannabis license

162
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,158
for cultivation yeah for me the most

163
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:02,158
critical nowadays is uh the requirements

164
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:04,598
about the facility and how to uh how to

165
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:06,680
be sure that we are fulfilling all the

166
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:09,959
requirements like narcotic for the

167
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,439
Spanish uh Health authorities so here we

168
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:15,719
have to think about the design of the

169
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:18,158
infrastructure and how the technician

170
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:22,759
that we need uh considering that it is a

171
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:26,120
plant and this is not like robust like a

172
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:28,960
Pharma uh product so but we have to

173
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,399
ensure at the end that it is a Pharma

174
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,958
product so it's not easy to manage a

175
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:36,918
part of the technician of the facility

176
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:40,759
uh the security measures and at the end

177
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:43,120
how to develop the quality system uh

178
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:45,958
showing the tability to the Spanish

179
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,000
authorities that is requesting like a

180
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:52,679
narcotic product so for me this is the

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,559
most critical point um it takes time so

182
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:59,199
it is we are speaking about a project

183
00:08:54,559 --> 00:09:02,479
that it will be more than two years so

184
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,800
and and and it's it's uh Spanish

185
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,600
authorities is changing the idea so the

186
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,919
requirements nowadays is not the same

187
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,360
like 6 months ago so I think that they

188
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:14,159
are learning so this for me this is the

189
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,600
most most critical point

190
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:20,958
now that's good also I would like to

191
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:24,120
know um what is the biggest handicap we

192
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:26,000
can find if we decide to start a start

193
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,399
the process yeah the handicap I think

194
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,399
that is two points one is the big

195
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,559
Investments so you have to consider that

196
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:39,120
it is we will be speaking about minimum

197
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:42,599
six or 8 to 10 million euro so and the

198
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,879
time so versus time so you have to when

199
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,759
you decide to go on at least you will be

200
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:50,399
more than two years or two years and a

201
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:53,399
half only doing investment so without

202
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,799
the vision of the market or the sales so

203
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:58,839
uh I think this is the big critical

204
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:01,958
point so yeah yeah we know it's is

205
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:05,320
stough is stuff to um allly in I would

206
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:08,559
like to say if you allow me that

207
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,839
listening to Aon and they are one of the

208
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,559
best companies that can help you how to

209
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:16,360
invest your money in Spain if you want

210
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:19,559
to go to GMP you products but I'm here

211
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:23,519
today because the black market exist and

212
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:25,319
the industry exist and uh as in Europe

213
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,078
and in Spain things are really really

214
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,519
slow we thank and appreciate the work

215
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:33,879
that other companies is uh and some

216
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,560
people is can go to prison any moment in

217
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:38,399
Spain so they are fighting a lot to get

218
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,439
approval from the agency and on the

219
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,399
other side there is a lot of cannabis in

220
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,079
Spain mhm and we are having this uh

221
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,240
strange situation right so at the end

222
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,958
the patients will stay go to canab

223
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,639
Social Clubs to the streets or grow at

224
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:57,119
home and it's not that easy know to to

225
00:10:54,639 --> 00:11:02,839
move on the pharmaceutical grade so it's

226
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:05,440
a big huge in in Spain thank you cara um

227
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:07,920
we can keep talking about the the

228
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,000
patients I would like to know what is

229
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,240
the European Union doing for patients

230
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,720
about

231
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,680
patients well I think the most important

232
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,360
things about patience is that we are not

233
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:23,399
going to be shut up anymore some

234
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:27,120
companies and some people used us as

235
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:30,399
puppets to get uh medicinal to get

236
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,679
cannabis and uh some we are starting to

237
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,399
to see in the industry some bad

238
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:37,799
practices in Europe we are not going to

239
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,919
shut up we are going to start some

240
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:44,399
webinars in April called uh we the

241
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:47,000
patients by found Cana we are going to

242
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,919
analyze what we are receiving in the in

243
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,278
the from the industry mhm no everyone

244
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,958
has to be regulated and who regulates

245
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,799
the people who is regulated we don't

246
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,479
know we have to trust them and we are

247
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:01,838
seeing things in Europe that we we don't

248
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,000
like at all so that's why the ICM

249
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:08,040
patient is so important right now also

250
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,720
we want to fight in Europe in Brussels

251
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:12,919
to harmonize our treatments why a

252
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,240
patient in Germany cannot have the same

253
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:19,240
as a person in Greece so that's why all

254
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,879
the patients uh the European went all

255
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,000
together to fight

256
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:26,838
this because we have the fight in our

257
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,720
countries like in Greece in Portugal in

258
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:30,560
Italy maybe the industry is happy

259
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,160
because they have so many licenses but

260
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:36,159
at the end the patients are alone mhm so

261
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,039
there is a big difference so we are

262
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:41,639
working on this and I think it's really

263
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:43,958
important this next step for the for not

264
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:47,079
happening the segment in us that each

265
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:50,439
each region has one kind of Regulation

266
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:52,719
and the patients are not harmonized so

267
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:56,360
we want the same we we don't want to

268
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,480
repeat the same mistakes in that in us a

269
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:04,079
lot of

270
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:07,278
[Applause]

271
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:11,559
a lot of work to to do still a lot of

272
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:13,559
work to do what about um em EMA what do

273
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:16,239
what do they do explain well the

274
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:19,958
International Association for canab

275
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:23,560
medicines was created 25 years ago by

276
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:27,559
Rafa misham Manuel guthman Fran gr and

277
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:30,119
Herman Donald ABS the right scientific

278
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:32,838
of the world they created this this

279
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,360
first Society of Canabis as medicine 25

280
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,000
years ago not an easy thing to do they

281
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,399
created in a house of frano house in

282
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,559
Germany and they become one of the most

283
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,399
important societies for Canabis as

284
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,599
medicine they fight in the European

285
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,839
government they fight in Brussels they

286
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,360
fight in Germany because it's where

287
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:54,759
frano is it and uh some years ago he

288
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:58,000
asked me carola we have to fight for the

289
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:59,879
patients because nothing is working the

290
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,720
industry is failing

291
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:03,759
you are strangling a lot in your

292
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,079
associations in your countries not to go

293
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,919
to jail you are helping people you know

294
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:12,278
you are not bad people you are doing

295
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:14,240
what you can you are patients too so we

296
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:17,958
decided to work together and we are in

297
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,399
this path right now no it's it's it's

298
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:22,879
it's tough to get any single step but

299
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,159
you have to keep pushing we have to keep

300
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:28,000
pushing but also we need support also we

301
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:30,519
need money also we need resources

302
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
because we are if fighting in Spain is

303
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:35,839
too much imagine fighting in the you in

304
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,759
European Union when you have these

305
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,199
countries like Germany with the

306
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:43,039
regulations and the programs they don't

307
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:45,559
care about Spain Greece Italy Portugal

308
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,958
but we care because we are all Europe

309
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:51,719
and we deserve the best and we see what

310
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:55,119
happened in France two days ago with the

311
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:58,440
flower yeah it's not things are not

312
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,919
looking good H yeah okay I will ask you

313
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,920
later because I know there's a lot of

314
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:07,799
people want to know how is the situation

315
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:11,559
in Spain about that regulation is coming

316
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:15,278
I will I will ad later um now

317
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:19,399
Chloe let us know please or um how do

318
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:20,439
you see the the future in a medical use

319
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:25,198
in in

320
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:27,959
US sure so I think the biggest thing

321
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:31,439
that is coming up in the US and it's not

322
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:34,758
a sure deal but um our health and human

323
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,519
services Federal agency has

324
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:40,318
recommended to the drug enforcement

325
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,318
agency that they reschedule cannabis

326
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:46,519
from schedule one in the Controlled

327
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:49,799
Substances Act to schedule three so this

328
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:52,318
would be the most important thing that's

329
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:55,879
happened in in cannabis regulatory

330
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:59,639
history in the US in I don't know 80

331
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:01,759
years maybe um so

332
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:04,959
what that would look like if the drug

333
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,639
enforcement agency decides to accept and

334
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:10,838
Implement that

335
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:13,759
recommendation is that um cannabis

336
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:15,160
operators would no longer be treated

337
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,600
like drug

338
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:21,318
dealers um so there's some taxation

339
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,560
components to that but I think one of

340
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:26,838
the really big impacts from a patient

341
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:30,479
standpoint is that it would really open

342
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:32,959
up the ability to do do research which

343
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,319
is much needed it's extremely difficult

344
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:38,679
to be able to do research on cannabis in

345
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:41,399
the US as a schedule one substance um

346
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:43,638
there's only a few different places that

347
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:46,039
researchers can get cannabis for

348
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:49,399
research and the quality is very very

349
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:52,198
low so it's not really even very useful

350
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:54,240
in terms of looking at what real

351
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:57,159
cannabis products look like and what

352
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,680
their impacts can be um so I think

353
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:02,240
research is is one of the big areas

354
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:05,399
that's going to be impacted but beyond

355
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,439
that just in terms of the stigma around

356
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:12,559
cannabis I think it would really help

357
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:16,120
shift um The Narrative and help the

358
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:19,038
society understand that cannabis is not

359
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:21,519
dangerous it's uh something that has a

360
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:24,679
lot of medicinal benefit and this was

361
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:27,679
just the first step towards uh I think

362
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:29,320
widespread acknowledgement of that and I

363
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,200
think there's a lot of people waiting

364
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:34,439
for the Federal Regulation do you think

365
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:38,919
that uh after the elections this

366
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:41,798
November something can change or oh man

367
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:45,080
you could look on Twitter and see any

368
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:47,960
number of people who claim to know

369
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:51,678
exactly what's going to happen I think

370
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:54,360
the situation is we don't really know

371
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:57,360
when the change is going to happen we

372
00:17:54,359 --> 00:18:01,359
don't know exactly what's going to

373
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:03,918
happen um something should be coming but

374
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:06,959
anyone who says that they know is you

375
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,440
know probably not telling the truth

376
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:13,960
let's see let's see we we'll we'll pay

377
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:17,798
attention and carola yes another uh TR

378
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:20,000
talk um how is the situation in Spain um

379
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:22,599
what happen here about the the medical

380
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,679
regulation it's a trend it's a everyone

381
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:29,399
is talking about the future Spanish

382
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:31,840
medical regulation let us know how the

383
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,759
situation no it's going to be solved in

384
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:38,558
a few months I mean I I hope that uh

385
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:41,400
when we finish 2024 the the second part

386
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:45,200
of the discrete negotiations with the

387
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:47,280
government will uh finished and then

388
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,279
they have to this because in the Spanish

389
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:52,359
system the NHS the is the public system

390
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:54,839
is going to pay for the our medicines so

391
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:56,918
they also have to discuss about funding

392
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:59,279
who's going to provide who to the

393
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:02,880
hospitals so it's going to be a lot of

394
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:05,038
things to discuss too while we um we are

395
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,000
complaining about what the government

396
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,200
offered to us so while we get an

397
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,640
agreement if we can if we have some

398
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,519
power let's go to the Press let's go PR

399
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,880
campaigns we are going we have a few

400
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:20,119
months to to try to make things better

401
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,280
in Spain if we don't do now then it's

402
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:24,918
going to be too late and too much work

403
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:28,158
to change anything from this law from

404
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:30,280
this uh decre so yeah I think I'm really

405
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:32,120
optimistic a little bit tired too

406
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:35,480
because it's too much to

407
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:38,399
deal um so many people waiting for

408
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:42,360
Relief so many people wanted for safe

409
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:45,440
medicine safe access education training

410
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:48,158
feeling safe not feeling like a criminal

411
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,798
in their houses for growing at home we

412
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:53,440
want the whole plant we going to grow at

413
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:56,879
home but we know that at first we need

414
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,038
to pharmaceutical for my mother for my

415
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,559
grandmother for the people that maybe

416
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:04,839
cannot grow at home make their own exts

417
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:07,759
go to found Canan analysis come back

418
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:10,639
delute make your topicals it's too much

419
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:14,679
for a patient yeah it is so we need

420
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:17,280
places to be maybe call and receive our

421
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:19,640
medicine to sometimes it's too much to

422
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:22,678
survive so taking care of the plants and

423
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:25,600
making all the process in my case I'm my

424
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:28,038
decreasing communication it's not uh

425
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,639
plants agriculture whatever it's new to

426
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:31,640
me and I have have to learn because it's

427
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,520
a question of

428
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,679
survival and the black market is

429
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:38,480
sometimes too black in Madrid and we

430
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:41,360
have seen with the analysis that is full

431
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,240
of eoli the Canabis social clubs are

432
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:48,639
better but they are too expensive and

433
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:51,200
the only exist in Barcelona mayorca IA

434
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,679
the canar icelands but the rest of Spain

435
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,759
doesn't have canab social clubs there

436
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,679
are not too many so canab social clubs

437
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:01,279
there are people making good work but

438
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:03,679
still the patients need to feel safe and

439
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,918
we are not feeling safe right now so we

440
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:09,200
are trying to change this and we are

441
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,000
trying to make the law as we are the

442
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,759
last ones in Europe with

443
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,759
Belgium let's try to learn from the

444
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:19,440
mistake of all the countries have made

445
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:22,000
in Europe to make the the best program

446
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,840
possible no the mistakes the things they

447
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,119
do well this is what you have to do in

448
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:30,599
this in this next months and this will

449
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:33,879
mark the way Spain is going to provide

450
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:36,038
us the medicine so yeah it's it's

451
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,320
passionate moment for us right now do

452
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:40,319
you feel

453
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:45,240
positive I think that uh they're going

454
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:48,918
to start with a very closed and uh

455
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:53,000
protect uh scenario in the hospitals

456
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:56,440
with only public uh hospitals no private

457
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,839
practices no green cards for 100 they

458
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,120
don't do what they don't want that also

459
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:03,879
if they're going to pay for the

460
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,918
product they are treating us as

461
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,120
criminals before making the program

462
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,720
already because they think we're are

463
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:14,119
going to sell the oil and no I need it

464
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:15,759
to survive so it's like the Spanish

465
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:20,038
government is

466
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:23,158
so aware of the we now have

467
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:26,679
spanis we have 5 million users Canabis

468
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:29,640
in Spain 100 Canabis Social Clubs they

469
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:31,559
are so frightened of each move move can

470
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,640
do with to the other industry and so

471
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:37,000
many people is making a lot of money

472
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,960
from the black market in Spain there is

473
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,400
a there is we can do a Netflix show with

474
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,519
Spanish situation it's crazy as hell

475
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,679
yeah it is yeah yeah yeah and do you

476
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:48,720
know already how it's going to be the

477
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:50,159
access for the patients the access to

478
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,558
the to the Cannabis is going to be from

479
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,760
Pharmacy is going to

480
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:57,440
be in the hospitals I mean you have to

481
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:59,000
go to the from the moment you have to go

482
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,640
to the

483
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,400
I don't know you have a disease and but

484
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,880
your primary care doctor cannot

485
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,559
prescribe you cannabis and they gave me

486
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,520
methadon the other

487
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:13,440
day but they they cannot prescribe

488
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,679
cannabis because it has to be done for a

489
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,640
specialist in the unity of pain but the

490
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,600
unity of pain for me having ketamin IV

491
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,360
treatment I have to wait one

492
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:28,918
year or will pay

493
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:31,319
00600 per three year per three months

494
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:34,559
so this is how the public system is

495
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:36,639
working so if you only give us the

496
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,960
public system it's not going to work

497
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,640
because we are too much many people the

498
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,558
pharmacies in the hospitals are

499
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,320
overloaded we already know they have to

500
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:48,038
learn how to use cannabis because it's

501
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:50,158
not easy for them to they don't know

502
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:52,038
anything about cannabis the other day in

503
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:56,559
the meeting in the minister of Health

504
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:58,798
with the doctors they confus CBD with

505
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:02,240
dronabinol so this is the point the

506
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:04,599
Spain is so everyone is saying like push

507
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,480
carola push carola and it's like well

508
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:10,199
the observatory can do what we can but

509
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:13,120
we are fighting ignorant people who is

510
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,360
paid by the pharmacy companies the big

511
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,798
Pharma not the Pharma from the Cannabis

512
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:21,278
industry the big big

513
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:24,440
Pharma and uh Spain is one of the best

514
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:27,880
place for lobes to do whatever they want

515
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:31,399
and we know that with the sun with the

516
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:33,320
cannabis it's it's a Spain it's a Spain

517
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:34,959
we we have to deal with it but they

518
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:37,359
don't they don't they don't realize they

519
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,278
don't realize yet but let's Crush our

520
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:41,000
fingers you know which kind of products

521
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:43,398
would be in the market don't if it going

522
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,519
to be flowers tinters structions it's

523
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:49,879
soon to say but I think uh the formulas

524
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:53,839
magistrales at the end is going to be

525
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:56,399
the way but we are fighting so hard to

526
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:58,519
have flowers with us because we need

527
00:24:56,398 --> 00:25:01,079
they they remove the fanil from for

528
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:05,398
chronic pain patients because of the

529
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:08,038
overdoses we were having but uh we need

530
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:09,519
some rescues and we said to the

531
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:13,319
government in the other day in the

532
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:15,720
meeting we need flowers we need a rescue

533
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:18,798
imagine that I'm diabetic will you not

534
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:21,880
give me insulin if I'm having a insulin

535
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:23,679
crisis and he said yes and I say why

536
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,039
don't you give a rescue to a pain

537
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:29,919
patient we we can fell down any minute

538
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:31,599
and lose Consciousness they don't care

539
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,880
they they they don't know what to say to

540
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:37,519
you because it's as long as the

541
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,440
companies sell the Cannabis in other

542
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:42,720
countries they're not going to help us

543
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,880
either because they have their business

544
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:49,120
running and there is we are alone and no

545
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:51,080
way for patients to to grow any plant

546
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:53,119
that's not on the table at all in Spain

547
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:55,879
you can grow at home but you can go to

548
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:58,918
jail because if a neighbor complains You

549
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:01,919
Can the police come to your house maybe

550
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:03,759
you can go to jail for 48 hours and then

551
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,720
go to a judge and then the Jil will

552
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:09,278
decide if you are drug dealer or not I'm

553
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,558
so sorry I'm I'm too old I'm too tired

554
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:14,480
I'm too my pain is too high to deal I'm

555
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:16,119
just I'm just making my medicine because

556
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,079
you don't provide

557
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:21,839
me so if you want to take me to jail do

558
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:25,319
it but I'm not going to stop taking care

559
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:25,319
of myself because you don't do

560
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:32,398
it I'm not going to hide I'm not going

561
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:35,918
to hide if we don't

562
00:26:32,398 --> 00:26:39,158
fight we are done yeah no I I understand

563
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,640
just because it's been a really long and

564
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:44,880
tough and tough way I I really know

565
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:49,038
carola so thank you for your work and

566
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,840
chlo you know um or could you tell us

567
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:54,038
how is the way of requirements to become

568
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:56,319
a patient in in us or for example in

569
00:26:54,038 --> 00:27:01,398
Florida in the state

570
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:04,359
to you work requirements to become a a p

571
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:06,278
yes so it like many other things in the

572
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:09,479
US cannabis industry it differs

573
00:27:06,278 --> 00:27:12,200
immensely from state to state um

574
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:15,079
generally you have to have a

575
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:18,360
recommendation not a prescription from a

576
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:21,119
doctor um actually the recommendation

577
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:24,479
rather than prescription is one of the

578
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:27,678
ways that the Cannabis system works

579
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,159
outside of the federal um regulatory

580
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,759
landscap you know because federal law

581
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,880
doesn't allow cannabis right now drugs

582
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:39,359
are ferally regulated and prescribed

583
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:42,240
based on um Federal Regulations so

584
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:46,278
recommendation rather than prescription

585
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:49,000
from a doctor for a qualifying condition

586
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:53,159
um you have to be a resident of the

587
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:56,919
state um and usually there's not too

588
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:59,600
much more to it there's usually a fee um

589
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:03,440
but in some states that are pretty

590
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:06,240
anti-cannabis anti-p patient they put a

591
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,798
lot of blocks into place to try to make

592
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,519
it as difficult as possible um for

593
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:15,319
patients to get certified so that can

594
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:17,480
mean having to have a recommendation

595
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:19,480
from two separate

596
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,200
Physicians um having to have a

597
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,720
recommendation from two separate

598
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,880
Physicians and two different areas of

599
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,880
medicine so that makes it very difficult

600
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,320
especially when you're in the early

601
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,440
phases of a medical program where there

602
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:38,000
is a lot of stigma there is a lot of

603
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:40,480
fear from Physicians um but luckily it

604
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,558
those those types of policies tend to

605
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,319
open up over time as people see that the

606
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:48,839
sky is not going to fall that people

607
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:52,759
actually have a legitimate medical use

608
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:56,158
for cannabis and that it's not just um

609
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:58,798
just an excuse you know so I think we

610
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,080
see a lot of progress over time

611
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:05,200
as I hope Spain will as

612
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:08,240
well and when the doctor prescrib you

613
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:12,038
some cannabis is like um you have like a

614
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:14,798
total um amount of grains per month or I

615
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:18,839
don't know any milliliters of any tinter

616
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:20,720
or Oils yeah how does it work it differs

617
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:24,278
from state to state I'll just use

618
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:28,360
Florida as an example um in Florida the

619
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:32,000
doctor can um recommend certain products

620
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:34,038
forms for you so flour for example is

621
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,319
recommended for some patients and not

622
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:42,798
others Edibles some patients not others

623
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:45,720
um and then you get a total allotment of

624
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:48,319
milligrams um of of cannabis that you

625
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,960
can get or milligrams of THC and CBD

626
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:53,759
that you can get and when you go make

627
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,840
purchases there's a state system that

628
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:59,278
tracks all of your purchases and draws

629
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:02,079
down on a monthly basis basis against

630
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:06,200
your total allotment but in other

631
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:08,558
markets uh there usually isn't any

632
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,720
specificity from the doctor in terms of

633
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:14,558
what forms you can use so a lot of the

634
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:17,038
education about product types and what

635
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:19,879
product types are good for different

636
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:22,839
conditions happens at the point of sale

637
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:26,720
which is kind of interesting um a lot of

638
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:29,558
doctors are pretty reluctant to tell um

639
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,319
patients this product type or this

640
00:30:29,558 --> 00:30:34,519
product form would be good for your

641
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:37,278
condition but I think more of that is

642
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:40,679
needed and hopefully as research opens

643
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:43,599
up we'll see more medical guidelines in

644
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:46,399
terms of how cannabis is recommended and

645
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:50,599
did you have to renew your prescription

646
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:53,000
also it's like yes yes so um usually

647
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:56,240
it's a annual renewal which requires

648
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,960
another trip to the doctor so that adds

649
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,759
some expense of course and also you know

650
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,639
makes it a little bit more difficult for

651
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:09,759
patients some states allow um tea tea do

652
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:12,719
so um a video call with your doctor but

653
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:15,960
a lot require you to go into your doctor

654
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,360
every 6 months every year to ensure that

655
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,038
you still have your qualifying condition

656
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:24,000
and then your paperwork is processed

657
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:27,200
with the state and your card or

658
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,839
registration is renewed or not thank you

659
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,679
chlo and and I don't know carola we were

660
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:37,638
talking about an um German rapper about

661
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:41,880
what German rapper about an aders

662
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:45,000
time you remember no um we were talk

663
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,159
okay no okay we were talking about um

664
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,759
because the Germany

665
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:52,278
legalization the way they were using

666
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:55,319
patients and you told me something about

667
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:56,480
a singer and a German singer and there

668
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:59,599
was an

669
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,759
adverstisement was not very okay don't

670
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:07,439
worry don't worry about that about that

671
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:10,960
and so H when do you think let's go back

672
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,159
to the regulation um you said that it's

673
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:17,558
going to be like in two months 6 months

674
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:20,480
is going to be like the last step so if

675
00:32:17,558 --> 00:32:22,759
in six months we don't have finally the

676
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,440
regulation it's like the last chance

677
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:27,519
because we've been waiting for two years

678
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,960
well the issue is that also we have the

679
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,399
news from yesterday in catalunia that uh

680
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:35,278
they have elections in two months so the

681
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:37,079
situation in Spain uh let's see what

682
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:38,679
happens with the government because if

683
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:41,678
the government falls

684
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:44,200
again I'm sorry but we are not going to

685
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,600
make another four years in the Congress

686
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:49,880
it has been 10 years I think it's too

687
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:55,319
much we have been through too much they

688
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:57,639
have mistreated us too much so um we are

689
00:32:55,319 --> 00:33:00,278
like already prepared for something to

690
00:32:57,638 --> 00:33:03,638
happen happen when we want to touch the

691
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:06,240
final get the flower then suddenly a

692
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:10,918
pandemic then suddenly new elections and

693
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:14,319
suddenly 155th in catalunia some really

694
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:17,679
a hot happens in our our country when we

695
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:19,960
were about to touch the glory and we

696
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,798
lost and we lost and we lost and we lost

697
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:24,919
we touch it we lost it we touch it we

698
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:28,119
lost it so now I'm just trying to be

699
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:30,759
neutral because it uh it it hurts me

700
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:34,798
like a patient in my pain and in my

701
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:38,679
health mental health and uh we think

702
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:41,519
that now is the moment that now we we

703
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:44,038
need a lot of support in Spain to say to

704
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:47,159
the minister of Health we wi flowers we

705
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:52,480
want private private practices we want

706
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:55,720
primary doctors to prescribe we want uh

707
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,798
also need a program that takes care of

708
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,679
the quality of life more than the

709
00:33:57,798 --> 00:34:01,879
symptoms and they are talking about a

710
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,080
lot of clinical trials and whatever and

711
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,159
I

712
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:08,159
understand but the patients we are not

713
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:13,398
going to wait and we are going to be

714
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:15,320
medicated yes or yes so uh the agency is

715
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:18,039
taking too much long to make some

716
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,879
decisions because that we said

717
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:24,279
before uh but they have to finish any

718
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:27,838
minute you know so I think by December

719
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:30,399
we will have the final project and the

720
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:31,960
final agreements and uh I don't know

721
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:33,838
when the first patient is going to

722
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:37,280
receive the oil if this is the question

723
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:39,398
you ask me but uh because we have still

724
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,679
lot of work to do and they don't provide

725
00:34:39,398 --> 00:34:45,199
us any calendar so we don't

726
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:47,398
know uh everything is a mess so we don't

727
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:50,158
know and we are ready for everything and

728
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:52,279
the they can call you come tomorrow or

729
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,159
they can call you not to come or they

730
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:58,240
can call you we need this

731
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:03,920
uh it's crazy it's crazy

732
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:07,000
is there any change to change um Pepe or

733
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,760
box mins do you think if this happens we

734
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,119
are dead because the Pepe just uh party

735
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:16,480
of popular just present AAL proposition

736
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,559
for non law in Spain saying the

737
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,519
government not to regulate Canabis as

738
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:24,440
medicine when it was approved they're

739
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:27,199
crazy so imagine a government with them

740
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,159
and box that they insult me in the

741
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:30,759
government

742
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,960
so it's impossible it's not going to

743
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:36,359
happen so if we don't do now it's not

744
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,800
going to happen at least in five

745
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:41,960
years okay if the when the government

746
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,400
crashes I mean elections and then the

747
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:48,159
