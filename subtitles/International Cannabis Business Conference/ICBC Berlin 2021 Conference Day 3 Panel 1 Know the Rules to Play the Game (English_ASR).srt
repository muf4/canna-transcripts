00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,679
whatever it is

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,840
after this last year and a half holy

20
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,000
we're still here and we're only

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,520
going to get better

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,439
little disclaimer i always have to do

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,359
this i'm not a lawyer i'm not a cpa no

24
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:56,000
matter what you do in this industry you

25
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:58,000
must use these sorts of professionals

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,719
structuring companies tax finance

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,640
regulation you do one thing wrong

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,118
you lose your license you do one thing

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,040
wrong you go to jail

30
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,959
it's serious this is a once in a

31
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,799
lifetime opportunity when it comes to

32
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,239
capital raising structuring your

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,000
companies and creating things that are

34
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,719
going to be legacy entities or

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,560
generational wealth that only happens

36
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:22,158
once in a blue moon

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,719
like alcohol happened tobacco happened

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,640
tech happened what other big pioneer

39
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,560
industries do we have so you're like i'm

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,840
gonna do this new thing there's a time

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,519
and a place for that but if there's

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,439
professionals that have been there and

43
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,359
done that you don't go climb everest and

44
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:37,199
be like i think that's a great idea i'm

45
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,959
gonna do that without a guide

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,680
maybe wim hof

47
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,798
but

48
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,960
i don't even think he wore clothes or

49
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,720
anything wim hof you know him anyways

50
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,199
sorry if i offend you your company your

51
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,560
business you can't fix stupid

52
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,000
so

53
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,000
not to offend but like when you fight

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,478
the truth you lose

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,560
so the truth being i've done this for 15

56
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,159
years i'm originally a farm kid from

57
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,600
wisconsin

58
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,439
you know pretty poor farm kid

59
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:04,158
wisconsin's kind of like germany lots of

60
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:07,599
beer mustard new glarus like

61
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:10,399
cheese sauerkraut sour reuben like very

62
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,639
similar lots of german sounding towns so

63
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,400
very very familiar with that but uh i

64
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,359
was in the united states air force and

65
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,360
was a crypto linguist

66
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,840
but that

67
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,000
ability of being in the military that

68
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,920
professionalism and learning i also got

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,680
hurt in the service so it was like hey

70
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,359
if i hadn't gotten hurt i would have

71
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,200
never found cannabis so i got out when i

72
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,200
was 22 and a half went to colorado in

73
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,839
2006

74
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:38,318
and tried cannabis compared to 14 drugs

75
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,400
i was like this plant's incredible

76
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,079
it's worth giving a life to like all of

77
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,400
us have pretty much done and there's so

78
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,239
many stories like that but having been a

79
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,439
true pioneer and not having gotten

80
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,878
killed yet

81
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,159
i've got some lessons for you from these

82
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,598
trenches and i want to share that based

83
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,959
on eu and what's happening in the rest

84
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,119
of the world

85
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,439
i'll definitely use that microphone that

86
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,480
microphone how's that

87
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,560
oh

88
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:04,560
double fisting technology anyways

89
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,158
global cannabis some shit's happening

90
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,080
it's 2020

91
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,158
one

92
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,440
do you remember when we first started

93
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,719
the compassionate use 1996 in california

94
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,039
and then all these other countries

95
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,878
happened and then things started moving

96
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,158
and then uruguay legalized and we

97
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:21,439
thought that the

98
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,719
international narcotics control board

99
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,878
was just going to destroy that little

100
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,719
country and nothing happened

101
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:30,079
and then canada happened on a medical

102
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,598
basis for federal as a country

103
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,440
and then some other countries did that

104
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,439
under compassionate use laws because

105
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,598
normally a new drug or something has to

106
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,000
go through so much clinical trials api

107
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,839
development you can't just start making

108
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,680
medical claims but remember in the 80s

109
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,759
when aids got fricking crazy and people

110
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,599
were like dying in the streets like we

111
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,079
don't have time

112
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,919
to go for 11 years people are dying and

113
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,760
the risks of these new drugs and

114
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,359
antivirals

115
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,120
are worth the cost

116
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,799
and cannabis is literally the same

117
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,640
program that's how we have compassionate

118
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,519
use medical programs in the united

119
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,000
states

120
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,519
and internationally but it's those sorts

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,840
of things that that you only have a

122
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,719
window that that happens and it's this

123
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,158
low global landscapes developing i mean

124
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,759
the united states were close to 30

125
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:15,598
billion probably in revenue of cannabis

126
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,199
sales this year legal for medical and

127
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:18,238
adult use

128
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,840
i mean

129
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,679
the illicit market in the united states

130
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,918
many people thinks like 50 60 billion

131
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,680
it's like close to 200 billion

132
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,279
not tracked and logged not taxed and

133
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,280
that's just transitioning from one thing

134
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,879
to another so this isn't a brand new

135
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,359
thing that we're scared people might not

136
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:35,519
use as investors people already use it

137
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,840
but we're making standardized consumer

138
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,599
packaged goods and as this is happening

139
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,519
you have one shot to secure some of

140
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,439
these opportunities

141
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,639
now just like giada said the most

142
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,839
interesting thing that happened this

143
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,160
last year

144
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,399
was in december and like i said uh at

145
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,919
the investment forum a few days ago like

146
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,679
when ukraine leaned forward and he's

147
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:55,680
like yes

148
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,720
i was like damn he put us over the line

149
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,680
and we didn't think that was going to

150
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,440
happen

151
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,280
but we rescheduled cannabis

152
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,319
internationally so it's no longer like

153
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,079
heroin

154
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,800
which cannabis was the same as heroin

155
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,959
until december last year we were all

156
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,240
like watching netflix and pajamas and

157
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,120
the un

158
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,120
amended the scheduling for cannabis

159
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,519
still needs more research but has been

160
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,759
shown to have some medicinal benefit

161
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,079
boom step one of three steps that's

162
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,680
going to change the global landscape so

163
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,038
it's not like is that going to happen it

164
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,879
frickin did

165
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,360
now all of the member nations of the

166
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,519
united of the united nations that signed

167
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,879
that drug compact the 1961 single

168
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,758
convention treaty on psychotropic

169
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,279
substances are in violation of

170
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,319
international law that they said that

171
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,319
they would agree to so we're all

172
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,240
supposed to amend our own csas

173
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,240
controlled substances act to be in

174
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,400
alignment with that drug policy that we

175
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,918
ratified again in 1971 and a bunch of

176
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:49,038
times after

177
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,198
so

178
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,879
this is huge news for investors what's

179
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,800
going to happen clinical trials

180
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,879
standardization of drugs not just like

181
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,160
gw pharmaceuticals with epidiolex and

182
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,439
some of those kind of crappy products

183
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,280
that are really expensive not super

184
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,439
efficacious and have a few milligrams of

185
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,959
something from a plant

186
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,600
it's going to allow other people to do

187
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,680
that but that company's what market cap

188
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,280
eight billion dollars

189
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,600
for a little pill that's got 2.5

190
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,679
milligrams of thc and 2.5 milligrams of

191
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,919
cbd in it

192
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,360
huh interesting yeah the united nations

193
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,000
kind of a big deal

194
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,919
so raising capital in this industry is

195
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,319
very hard because it has been federally

196
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,399
illegal like we break every day in the

197
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,039
united states i break federal law with

198
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,719
everything i do like pablo escobar was

199
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,800
like very little compared to what i've

200
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,639
done in like racketeering going state to

201
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,560
state i don't fly with weed from one

202
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,038
state to another but like what we've

203
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,360
literally done

204
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,199
big time and many of you too like we're

205
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,400
talking about something that's literally

206
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,639
illegal

207
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,478
and how to facilitate forming companies

208
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,000
that's why many german lawyers or others

209
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:54,079
in the beginning with the tinder they

210
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,240
couldn't even work with companies even

211
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,399
on guam or many states the state supreme

212
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,240
court or bar station bar association

213
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,318
will say you can't work with cannabis

214
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,560
and it's like we're lawyers we're kind

215
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,560
of looking out for our client interests

216
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,918
so it's really hard to raise capital you

217
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,598
can't just go to a bank and be like i've

218
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,038
got a business plan

219
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,038
family offices high net worth

220
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:16,478
individuals you go on public in a

221
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:18,719
country that is legal canada the css cse

222
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,318
tsx that's why all of those canadian

223
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,319
public companies were able to happen

224
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,160
after 2015

225
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,560
because it wasn't federally illegal

226
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,160
there i can't just start an ipo and go

227
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,918
to nasdaq and be like hey cannabis

228
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,520
company it's like this is a federal

229
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:32,719
exchange that's federally illegal you

230
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,439
can't raise money to do something

231
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,280
federally illegal on a federal exchange

232
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,879
so it's kind of hard but if

233
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,478
you're not first you're last but

234
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,639
sometimes when you're first you actually

235
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,079
get freaking murdered which if you don't

236
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,000
do it right so there's definitely some

237
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,359
navigation that needs to happen

238
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,120
united states is one of these key

239
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,439
markets that being there breaking

240
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,199
federal law state by state the cannabis

241
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,519
we grow in one state we can't bring it

242
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,199
to another state to sell it

243
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,279
so it's like i have to grow cannabis in

244
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,360
alaska to sell it in alaska i have to

245
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,598
manufacture vape cartridges edibles

246
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,120
chocolates in massachusetts from

247
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,199
cannabis grown in massachusetts to

248
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,360
stellen massachusetts but people can

249
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,360
come from another state to buy it there

250
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,038
in the united states now there's 19

251
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,199
states

252
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:17,360
that have legalized adult use cannabis

253
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,080
for 21 years or older

254
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,919
there's only about 10 well 10

255
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,359
currently doing active sales

256
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,359
dc doesn't really count where our

257
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,560
capital is even though it's legal but

258
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,080
there's this harris amendment that

259
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,160
doesn't allow the federal the feds are

260
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:31,839
like we won't give you any taxes

261
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,440
but and they won't allow stores but it's

262
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,679
literally legal

263
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,039
in washington dc for recreational

264
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,718
cannabis

265
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:40,080
where our capital is where buffalo man

266
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,360
like went and kind of like took it over

267
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,440
in january which we don't like to talk

268
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,759
about but kind of happened

269
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,440
but the united states is emerging fast

270
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,278
this is where we make all of our revenue

271
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,880
all possibilities happen based on what's

272
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,039
in the united states and when you see

273
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,278
brands and consumer packaged goods and

274
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,719
the development of new genetics

275
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:58,720
next door and like charling with

276
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,360
bedrakan in the netherlands like they

277
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,720
have their sick standardized genetics

278
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,159
in the united states when you look at

279
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,160
phyllis bioscience and some of these

280
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,079
galaxies of genetics like there's over

281
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,480
16 thousand

282
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,480
individual different cultivar chemo bars

283
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,360
or if you wanna say strains

284
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,920
like this type of dog hund ein hoon spy

285
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,560
hoons dry like sixteen thousand in the

286
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:22,079
united states alone but from land race

287
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,838
varieties and everything else this is a

288
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,920
dioecious plant

289
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,839
meaning like cannabis keeps its house it

290
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,838
sex in two houses there's a male plant

291
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,440
and a female plant but the development

292
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,160
and genetics there you can't protect

293
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,839
them like driscoll in the united states

294
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,600
biggest berry company in the world but

295
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,120
they have they make eight percent off of

296
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,200
every plant that they sell and they get

297
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,639
first-rate refusal on the strawberries

298
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,879
the blueberries

299
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,039
you know the raspberries but without

300
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,639
even having to grow a single plant now

301
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,719
you can't protect a genetic if i get a

302
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,559
seed of yours or cutting of yours a

303
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,920
clone and i make a copy of that like i

304
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,439
go to your grandma's house and she's got

305
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,799
a nice african violet and i take that

306
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,800
little leaf and put in some water grows

307
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,639
a little roots that's a clone like that

308
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,159
dolly sheep

309
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:03,600
it's the exact same thing but you can't

310
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:04,559
sue me for stealing your intellectual

311
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,399
property

312
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,239
because there's no breeders rights in

313
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,399
the united states internationally once

314
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,720
you standardize genetics you can start

315
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,078
to do brand licensing of those and

316
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,040
surprisingly in the us and

317
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,479
internationally it's not illegal to own

318
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,639
the intellectual property to do

319
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,920
something illegal

320
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,000
kind of crazy

321
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,599
so that's an ancillary opportunity which

322
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,360
isn't even high risk which big banks and

323
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,600
others could actually get into there's

324
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,120
more states coming forward it's only a

325
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,440
matter of time there was a two-week

326
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,560
period this last year where new york

327
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,040
governor signed adult use new jersey new

328
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:41,679
mexico and virginia and i was like what

329
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:43,919
the just happened

330
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,239
i'd been going slowly state by state

331
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,719
educate senators we get this medical law

332
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,079
passed it goes through a bunch of bs and

333
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,320
was just like boom boom boom boom boom

334
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:53,519
and i'm like holy

335
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,440
like i guess we're gonna need a bigger

336
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,959
boat like it was one of those moments

337
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,560
that it's like this is

338
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,399
faster than we even thought and we're

339
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,919
not ready for federal legalization in

340
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,600
the united states

341
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,278
because it's so compartmentalized state

342
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,240
by state doing different pesticide

343
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,919
regulations tracking taxation

344
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,600
that we're not actually ready to like

345
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,439
just do a massive consolidation because

346
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,120
the second that federal legalization

347
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,120
does happen

348
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,519
massive roll-ups institutional capital

349
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,679
will gobble up through consolidations

350
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,399
and mergers and none of you unless

351
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,759
you're that has a shot and like british

352
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,519
american tobacco philip morris

353
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,039
everybody's on the sidelines this is too

354
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,639
risky for them to play in these little

355
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:31,759
games they'll let us take all the risk

356
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,360
oh you're gonna make a couple hundred

357
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,759
million dollars here oh you a billion

358
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,120
dollar valuation that's cute

359
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:38,639
i'm gonna buy you

360
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,879
and if you don't sell to me i'll destroy

361
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,799
you like these are very powerful

362
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,720
entities that have generational wealth

363
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,958
behind them that we have one shot to

364
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,240
build this and as i commonly say it's

365
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,759
not about i'm going to be the next

366
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,919
pfizer or i'm going to be the next

367
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,078
amazon there already is a pfizer there

368
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,519
already is an amazon you want to sell to

369
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,519
them

370
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,480
very seldomly do you actually get to

371
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,839
have a disruptive company like airbnb

372
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,360
but then you'll have challenger

373
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,440
companies like

374
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,278
vrbo or the 19 other million things you

375
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,279
got uber and then you got dd and then

376
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:11,200
you got this and then you got

377
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:14,000
you know here now or whatever you guys

378
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,680
use of rooms i don't know so the united

379
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,200
states look what's happening there

380
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:20,000
because it's going to dictate kind of

381
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,079
like what's happening in europe

382
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,600
12 minutes in kicking ass one of the

383
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:25,519
biggest things is understanding cost of

384
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,720
goods sold in europe so you're like i'm

385
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,320
going to be the next world leader in

386
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,560
germany i'm going to have this massive

387
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,560
greenhouse see large denmark or some

388
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,399
other places it's like what's the cost

389
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:37,119
of production there what's your vat

390
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,360
taxes what's your climate remember farm

391
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,278
kid how much does it cost me to grow

392
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,639
that echinacea to make one gallon of

393
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:46,000
milk or 3.78 liters you know

394
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,639
americans with our measurement

395
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
systems we're so idiots sorry about that

396
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,399
apologizing in advance for america

397
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,600
little toddlers but what happened

398
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,200
originally

399
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,959
is yeah we're like new like you guys

400
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,720
been around for hunt like thousands of

401
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,159
years people have been living here and

402
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,320
the same in america but like with like

403
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,159
developed civilizations

404
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,760
we get this first mover opportunity just

405
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:08,879
like the canadians and that's why they

406
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:10,720
built like

407
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,639
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of

408
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,120
hectares of greenhouses outdoor

409
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,720
plantations massive warehouses like

410
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,799
tilrey like i'm gonna take a giant

411
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,959
chocolate factory and make it into a

412
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,559
giant weed factory like when it costs

413
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,359
you 600

414
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,559
or

415
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,639
520 some euros to produce one pound or a

416
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,000
half a kilo of cannabis that doesn't

417
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,360
make sense from an agricultural

418
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,360
standpoint

419
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,839
temperature airflow humidity daytime

420
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,240
highs nighttime lows precipitation frost

421
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,760
free days all of these things determine

422
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,799
where is the best place to grow

423
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:45,039
strawberries or oranges or pineapples or

424
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,479
whatever agricultural commodity it is

425
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,078
which this is the plant we're

426
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,399
talking about that makes amazing

427
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,479
biological compounds it's also an

428
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,159
entheogen just like lots of other plants

429
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,560
in fungi that are illegal

430
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,240
but only do one weird thing at a time

431
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:59,679
you know cannabis we got to get this

432
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,360
thing legal in medicine for everybody

433
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,838
but if you understand your cogs you're

434
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,680
raising capital it's not just about that

435
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,240
if you're not first your last thing

436
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,759
sometimes being first is stupid

437
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,278
but like license is hopefully the

438
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,480
person's maybe not here but yesterday

439
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:13,838
there's this person's like i have this

440
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,480
license i'm like i would have literally

441
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,279
gotten you 10 million euros for that

442
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,839
in 2017 i'm like i don't even really see

443
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:23,679
the value of like 150 200 000 for that

444
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,600
piece of paper anymore

445
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,359
there's pieces of paper that canopy

446
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,000
until ray and aurora went after that

447
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,600
they spent 30 50 80 million dollars not

448
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,799
on bribes but like

449
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,800
government relations

450
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,839
and then those assets

451
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,919
have been sold for like three million

452
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,760
euros like what they did in spain what

453
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,879
they did in south africa what they like

454
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,759
they were like we're going to take over

455
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,360
south america and spend

456
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,278
billions

457
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,959
of investors money from their stock

458
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:54,720
exchanges and they don't have a single

459
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,000
position there anymore even though

460
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,399
that's where if you've heard of a

461
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
company like dole

462
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,759
if you hold your colombian positions

463
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,278
your peruvian positions and you make it

464
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,000
through and you understand your cogs

465
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,120
when this emerges and it's not this

466
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,278
compartmentalized patchwork of i can do

467
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,799
this here and not here and that and this

468
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,759
is a bonafide

469
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,919
commodity you're going to be dull

470
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,278
it's not going to be like oh we have a

471
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:18,639
greenhouse in iceland and like we're

472
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:20,320
going to take over the world yeah that

473
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,159
happened with canada didn't work so much

474
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,760
we buy their greenhouses we rebuild them

475
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,600
in the united states for like 10 cents

476
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,000
on the dollar right now and they just

477
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,680
keep growing more and more

478
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,360
so here we are europe

479
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,758
navigating this complex framework which

480
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,759
i've been doing since 2015

481
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,560
like having done you know denmark

482
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,720
germany portugal worked with slovenia

483
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:41,838
romanian kind of hempside poland

484
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,000
hempside

485
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,959
france like that first kind of r d

486
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,639
market

487
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,078
experiment thing is the only market we

488
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,399
haven't participated in from a new

489
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:51,838
license application standpoint which

490
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,278
getting that first piece of paper even

491
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,000
though i'm saying sometimes doesn't have

492
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,360
value they do majorly but when you think

493
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
about what's happening in the european

494
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,759
union minus brexit-ish kind of thing

495
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,958
which is kind of you know still one of

496
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,399
those touchy subjects over here but

497
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,078
that's going to be a unique opportunity

498
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,839
with the uk as well especially with

499
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:11,519
their commonwealths or like a couple

500
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,199
conversations yesterday like with france

501
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,480
or other places that still have those

502
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:16,000
territories

503
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,278
back from like imperialism days which we

504
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,958
don't like to talk about too much but

505
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:20,958
kind of still happened and actually

506
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,078
still super profitable from

507
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,479
war rape

508
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:25,679
tyranny from like 500 years ago

509
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,800
but

510
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,638
what's going to happen in europe is

511
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,879
going to dictate based on eu gmp

512
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,120
compliance standards especially with pix

513
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:35,198
countries so you know american kind of

514
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,360
scene here it's like we landed on the

515
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:38,879
shore we're like you europe like

516
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,560
we're gonna go do our own thing over

517
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,159
here it's awesome it's like we were with

518
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:43,599
you but like we don't wanna

519
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:44,879
like we're gonna sign this declaration

520
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,440
and do our own thing and it's like

521
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:50,078
what's over there what's to the west

522
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,320
who knows new new greenfield

523
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,519
opportunities blue ocean sorts of

524
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,000
opportunities and you're like it's going

525
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,679
to be incredible

526
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,639
we're going to like find all this stuff

527
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:02,479
and gold and then sometimes

528
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,640
sometimes you literally get murdered and

529
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,078
there's people there like this is ours

530
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,919
we're like i'm gonna go over here this

531
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:09,279
is a great idea and bam you fall off a

532
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,759
cliff

533
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:14,000
so sometimes being first is very very

534
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,679
important but it takes a lot of those

535
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,439
first pioneers that got out there and

536
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,959
like just like i like that bottom

537
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,400
picture there it's like if you do things

538
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,640
wrong

539
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,439
you're the same as that dude

540
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,520
like how you doing like

541
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,120
where you going

542
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,879
so as you're paving this way here this

543
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,959
is greenfield as well in europe it's

544
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,559
greenfield around the world and it's

545
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,919
greenfield in the united states but i

546
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:37,678
have seen hundreds and hundreds of

547
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,799
companies thousands

548
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,240
start fail scale merge

549
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,000
and it's not about i'm gonna go and

550
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,079
claim and plant my flag here and take

551
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,160
this like i said the other day it's like

552
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:49,759
you look left you look right that might

553
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,840
be your biggest competitor here or there

554
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:56,000
but when we collaborate in human culture

555
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:57,519
and human nature we always succeed more

556
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,880
like many of the languages i had to

557
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:02,400
study it's like there's no personal

558
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,640
pronoun of i it's only we this is ours

559
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,038
we share this and like we do and this

560
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,720
plant it's like i own this this is my ip

561
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:11,839
but like this plant we're caretakers of

562
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,839
it and it's our duty as an industry to

563
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,759
like develop this responsibly for one

564
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:17,839
time with some consciousness before it

565
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:20,400
just gets taken over and all of a sudden

566
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,359
you've got seagrams and bacardi

567
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,679
and

568
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,519
constellation and just giant companies

569
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,000
that have had things for like ever like

570
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,679
from fur trading to tobacco when there's

571
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,240
a new thing you've got one shot but it's

572
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,840
the collaboration of not like i'm gonna

573
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,599
use this investment it's mine yeah

574
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:37,918
sometimes i'm a fund manager i do

575
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,519
protect my portfolio companies but i

576
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,759
make them bigger by combining

577
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,200
investments of other investors

578
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,720
so really just think like even though

579
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,480
you're like this is mine and there's so

580
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,240
much competition out there

581
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,200
if you all collaborate you can be strong

582
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,480
against things and even though the

583
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,759
native americans were actually right in

584
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,679
this context we were kind of the wrong

585
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,038
ones but that metaphor just let it stick

586
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,880
with you if you do things wrong and you

587
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:58,798
think you know everything you literally

588
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,000
might get shot in the back front side

589
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:01,519
doesn't matter

590
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,279
even if it's the best idea in the world

591
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:04,720
they even still fail

592
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:06,319
so a big thing like with the dutch wheat

593
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,240
experiment i wanted to go over giada i

594
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:09,678
saw you yesterday so i had my staff use

595
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,038
one of yours

596
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,640
this was big we applied for this we

597
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,640
helped two groups to get this and also a

598
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,320
big united states company cookies brand

599
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,840
got this

600
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:19,200
so the wheat experiment we all know

601
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:22,000
about coffee houses in the red light

602
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,840
district and how that all works out

603
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,640
kind

604
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:27,519
of

605
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,120
not from personal experience of course

606
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,279
or any of you

607
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,519
um

608
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,759
so in the netherlands this whole

609
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:37,759
coffeehouse thing like

610
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,440
you can't grow it in the netherlands you

611
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,879
can't import it but they regulate the

612
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,400
sale of it for residents but then they

613
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,200
only check ids at the border near

614
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,038
germany at those certain coffee houses

615
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,960
so then the dutch government's like one

616
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:50,798
dutch love taxes

617
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,400
who doesn't but like taxes are like

618
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,400
heroin to a government and once they get

619
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,919
a taste that's how we've tricked so many

620
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,840
states into legalizing it's like tax

621
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,280
revenue jobs and they're like

622
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:01,199
and they literally become addicts and

623
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:02,960
then they'll fight the other markets and

624
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,279
they'll go after the illicit market

625
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,880
because they're not paying taxes and

626
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,399
more importantly especially like you

627
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,840
know lewis the past director of

628
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,759
marijuana enforcement division here had

629
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,519
to deal with like wow we're regulating a

630
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,359
new industry but then there's all these

631
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,759
pesticide issues or safety issues or

632
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,439
like i can't call osha to come and deal

633
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,599
with like all these bamboo stakes and

634
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,480
like people burning sulfur inside to

635
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:24,399
kill

636
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,159
kill fungus

637
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,600
you do that in like greenhouses or caves

638
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,480
and things like that but not when people

639
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,079
are there

640
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,360
this is the most important that's

641
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,119
happening on your goddamn continent

642
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,119
right now this is the first adult you

643
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,639
sanctioned weed experiment even though

644
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,239
it was a weed experiment before they

645
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,159
called it officially the weed experiment

646
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,599
it was hilarious when we were doing

647
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,280
those applications and having to

648
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,439
translate all this stuff into dutch it

649
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,839
was nuts but like this is the first

650
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,960
legally sanctioned produced cannabis in

651
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:50,240
europe

652
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,840
for europe

653
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,000
and you've all gone to amsterdam maybe

654
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,439
or maybe not and had an amsterdam space

655
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,119
cake or some random cones you're like

656
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,880
i'm gonna try this bubba kush or this

657
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:00,959
you had no idea what you're getting but

658
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,320
the amount of pesticides fungi and other

659
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,720
things in that from the test that we've

660
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,158
done from independent sampling not like

661
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,079
this maybe a little

662
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,000
not this one maybe

663
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:12,000
but these ten companies are the only

664
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,079
companies with licenses to do this and

665
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,400
the brands that are developed there

666
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,158
as tourists go there

667
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,360
and get familiarized with those consumer

668
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,360
package goods you're like i'm gonna

669
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,119
start a giant brand in germany or like

670
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:24,558
with this and that when it comes to

671
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:26,158
medical cannabis internationally it's

672
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,158
not about brands it's about cost of

673
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,240
production and like the contracts for

674
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,320
import export and all about compliance

675
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,240
it's not even about your brand at all

676
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:35,839
but this is going to change everything

677
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,839
for europe this is the foothold into

678
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,439
this continent got two exclusive

679
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:41,599
positions on investment there this is

680
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,519
going to be massive and not just for the

681
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,279
revenue the dutch will make but for the

682
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,038
ip and brand licensing companies that

683
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,038
are established the consumer recognition

684
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,798
of those consumer package goods and that

685
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:52,158
will dictate the entire future of this

686
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,079
continent and what's going to happen in

687
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,440
the next year year and a half two years

688
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:58,558
so is germany going to be the cannabis

689
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,840
capital of freaking europe no you're not

690
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:01,678
beef farm was kind of annoying to deal

691
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,199
with originally thank god the bee farm

692
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,280
informat all of these the danish

693
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,640
medicines agencies do what they do but

694
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,720
each one of those

695
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,159
is just like each state regulator like

696
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,679
that we have to deal with how are we

697
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,600
going to regulate pesticides how are we

698
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,200
going to give licenses who's going to

699
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,879
pay me more to do this i'm going to give

700
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,558
licenses to my brother and my cousin and

701
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,640
my uncle not talking about north

702
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,879
macedonia here but maybe or some other

703
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,400
places or greece or how the military is

704
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,520
going to do all italy's minus the hemp

705
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,798
side

706
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:28,639
awesome things are going to happen here

707
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:30,319
and thank god the bee farm allowed

708
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,880
compassion to use medical cannabis for

709
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,960
patients that needed medicine which is

710
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,480
the main reason we do what we do getting

711
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,240
medicine to people be it medical or

712
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,079
through adult use there's going to be

713
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,679
great companies here ancillary business

714
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:43,439
opportunities

715
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,519
you're not first

716
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,279
next door is think about some investment

717
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:48,480
there especially with bv and their taxes

718
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:50,240
be really careful with some of these

719
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,360
other novel cannabinoids as you're going

720
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,440
through europe you're like well i can't

721
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:55,519
get this license i'm gonna do cbd i'm

722
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,679
going to do delta 8. that's going to get

723
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:59,359
scheduled like heroin very soon whenever

724
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,960
you isolate something from nature it's

725
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,119
very dangerous and takes 11 years of

726
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,159
clinical trials and about half a billion

727
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,759
dollars

728
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,320
to know if it's safe or not even for

729
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:10,000
something like vitamin c

730
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:12,158
so just because there's this quasi gray

731
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,079
area it's literally black and white and

732
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,080
you can't build an empire on ambiguity

733
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:17,759
like that so you got to be very careful

734
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,279
pix countries are super important look

735
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,359
at all those blue ones in europe if you

736
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:23,519
do clinical trials drug development

737
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,798
standardization of medicines that's

738
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:25,918
where you can sell it to all the big

739
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:27,839
countries with all the money in the

740
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,759
world that have the largest market share

741
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,599
of drugs and then the generics start to

742
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,798
happen but any of the countries that are

743
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:34,879
in blue

744
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:36,879
that also have medical cannabis programs

745
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,720
massive opportunities

746
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,720
screw all that ip's super important i

747
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,319
talked about that a town the ancillary

748
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,319
opportunities are enormous also for

749
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:45,759
europe asses is starting to develop

750
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:49,038
because like i said

751
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:51,038
it's not illegal to own something

752
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:53,038
the property and knowledge on how to do

753
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,400
this or the real estate and like some of

754
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:56,960
our conversations this week like in the

755
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,120
united states we make 12 to 18 on real

756
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,919
estate where i own the building

757
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:03,839
and i'm literally making 18.8 percent

758
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,600
because they can't go to a bank i get

759
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:07,119
huge returns for our investors on that

760
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:08,558
and when it comes to just like our

761
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:10,558
dispensary is going to be illegal in

762
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:12,319
germany and then we'll which real estate

763
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,480
churches schools parks day cares

764
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,240
addiction centers industrial zoning one

765
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,000
manufacturing two commercial zoning for

766
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,720
this that the other like i got this

767
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,880
property it's going to work probably not

768
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,240
in my experience like 10 000 real estate

769
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,400
type plays

770
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,240
99 of the time if you have a property

771
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,360
it's not zoned correctly it doesn't have

772
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,200
three-phase power it doesn't have

773
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,359
natural gas doesn't have water doesn't

774
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,880
have legal access or entitlement no one

775
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,439
wants to go and live and work there like

776
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,278
the 40 20 hectare greenhouse in arizona

777
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,120
that accompany i'm not going to say

778
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:42,960
their name built

779
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,558
goddamn nowhere so you have to think

780
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,400
about all these things and really

781
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:48,558
analyze those but the ancillary side is

782
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,720
huge there was a hilarious pitches there

783
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:53,038
but i i think it self-censored me

784
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,880
because it was too too vulgar

785
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:56,558
i'll leave that up to your mind but in

786
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,840
the future just know

787
00:24:56,558 --> 00:24:59,599
when you're going through these new

788
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:01,119
greenfield places

789
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,719
if there's a body on your left and a

790
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:04,158
body on your right and something has

791
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,480
been done and people have failed

792
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,120
numerous times in other markets

793
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,079
like the most valuable thing in human

794
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,599
history is knowing what not to do

795
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:16,798
it's only through knowing what not to do

796
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:19,119
can you actually start to see what to do

797
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,960
so look at all these examples in canada

798
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,959
like giant warehouses high cost of

799
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,679
production using bad pesticides not

800
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,278
having good integrated pest management

801
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,360
i dealt with a company in colorado they

802
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:33,038
were not going to name 58 million in

803
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:35,519
revenue they were netting 300 000

804
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:37,919
58 million in revenue that's like an

805
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,839
airline profit margin even worse like

806
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,759
airlines are like one to like six maybe

807
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,439
southwest is like 12 probably not these

808
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,200
are numbers pre-rounded i don't know the

809
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,519
post ones

810
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,200
this is it we have a very short window

811
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:51,200
until these u.n laws start to happen

812
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,679
countries are going to start to fold and

813
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,600
massive positions like colombia where it

814
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,440
was first just oil now flour they're not

815
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,278
a picks country but like i can produce a

816
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,120
kilo of the highest quality cannabis

817
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:04,480
you've ever seen there

818
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:04,479
for about five euros

819
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:08,719
and less and less in the future through

820
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:11,440
combines and things

821
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,319
so agricultural commodity consumer

822
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,080
package goods retail consumer experience

823
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:18,240
if you focus on this like outside

824
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:19,759
industry things that are already known

825
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,079
you will succeed if you come up with

826
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:24,720
some hair brain idea on how to do a

827
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:27,199
cannabis cryptocurrency crowdfunding

828
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,720
program with some blockchain and

829
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,319
i don't know throwing some drunk hookers

830
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,240
in there too and you think that's gonna

831
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:33,200
be a great idea or like a body sushi

832
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,079
party

833
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,519
like we have to be mindful no i'm not

834
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,359
gonna say that company's name either we

835
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:42,079
have to be mindful in what we do this is

836
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:43,759
a once in a lifetime opportunity

837
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,119
this is probably the last great emerging

838
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:46,879
industry

839
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:48,798
in humankind

840
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,400
and if we do it right it's not just for

841
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:51,599
you and your profits or generational

842
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,679
wealth we're creating something we're

843
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,278
going to pass to future generations this

844
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,120
plant's been with us

845
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:58,480
literally from the sea squirt 330

846
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:59,918
million years ago through a weird little

847
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,919
evolution that made a cannabinoid

848
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,520
receptor and this thing's not even brain

849
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,278
that we're relatives to has been like

850
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:07,519
passing through that was a receptor for

851
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:09,519
a plant that hadn't even evolved yet

852
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:13,759
we're caretakers of this we're evolving

853
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:15,519
with this evolve adapt use good experts

854
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,278
we are fighting a war and need so much

855
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:18,879
capital to do this and a lot of the big

856
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:20,558
companies that are out there are very

857
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,320
terrifying investment opportunities but

858
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,558
there's so much good

859
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,798
to be done in this space and we can't do

860
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:28,398
without good collaboration so i really

861
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:29,918
appreciate the opportunity here today i

862
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:32,398
somehow made it on time i don't know if

863
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:35,840
i have a question or two for you or

864
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:35,839
if somebody has one quick question

865
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:39,918
don't be shy this you're once in a

866
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,159
lifetime it's you what do you got all

867
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,200
right where where where who did somebody

868
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,240
raise their hand

869
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,720
let's yell it out what you got

870
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,720
oh robert

871
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,319
here's the question like how do you like

872
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:03,679
small scale operations mom and pop type

873
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:05,200
things like little things kind of scale

874
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,240
like how do you fit into that especially

875
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,159
with like bio organic certifications so

876
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,480
one example in the united states organic

877
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:15,278
certification is through the usda the

878
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,640
united states department of agriculture

879
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:18,480
states can also do their own

880
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,159
certification and standards like oregon

881
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,599
and a few states can do that just like

882
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,039
each state can do their own pesticide

883
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,918
regulation

884
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:25,519
but when you're doing something

885
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,679
federally illegal it's really hard to

886
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:29,918
get federal organic certification so one

887
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,000
of my due diligence like

888
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,720
instant red flags if someone's like we

889
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,640
grow cannabis organically

890
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,480
so here's a 25 000 euro sentence for you

891
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,480
we cultivate cannabis following organic

892
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,640
methodologies using certified organic

893
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,558
inputs

894
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,559
i didn't say i was organic anywhere i

895
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:50,000
said the word twice i marketed you you

896
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:52,558
think it's organic

897
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,798
and it is close to it without that label

898
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:56,240
that is so expensive to do even as a

899
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:57,839
small farmer when we tried to get

900
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,000
organic certified it was like a ten

901
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,599
thousand dollar thing and it's like an

902
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,278
echinacea farm in like wisconsin you're

903
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:05,439
like you can't do that

904
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:07,599
so small mom and pops they've taken the

905
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,320
risks

906
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:12,480
merge merge consolidate grow and get

907
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:15,200
bought by something everyone can brew

908
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,880
beer everyone can make wine how many

909
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,798
people do it how many people had some

910
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,240
wine last night that was home brewed

911
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:21,839
it's fun to do once until you have to

912
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,798
clean all those bottles and deal with it

913
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:24,639
so

914
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:26,960
it takes a lot of money to do this well

915
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,038
compliantly scale take market share deal

916
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,798
with liquor distribution

917
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:32,000
but like i love a farmer's market more

918
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:33,599
than anyone

919
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,159
but like farmers markets how many

920
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:39,599
tomatoes are sold at farmers markets

921
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,720
versus in supermarkets it's about 1.3

922
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:42,158
globally

923
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,240
and that's including all like the really

924
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,159
poor countries that don't have cisco or

925
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,079
nestle or other types of things like

926
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,480
that so if you are a small mom and pop

927
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:53,038
and you have something unique you must

928
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,399
scale quickly or you will die

929
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:56,798
and if you make false statements or

930
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:58,639
health claims my product cures cancer

931
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:00,798
they will literally destroy you do not

932
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,120
make fake health claims

933
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:05,440
do not make fake certifications do not

934
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:07,038
lie do not make fraud and no matter what

935
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,960
there was a conversation or two

936
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,158
yesterday had like we're gonna do this

937
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,679
we have this building and this and that

938
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,320
i'm like i've literally

939
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,840
read your 160 page law and know that

940
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:17,200
what you're telling me is actually not

941
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:18,959
even possible

942
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,880
so if you're going to play this game and

943
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,159
you don't want to die you don't get shot

944
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,760
you don't want to lose all your family's

945
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,159
money or waste your life which is the

946
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:28,640
only thing you have

947
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,919
know the rules to play the game and if

948
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,960
you can help to write them and influence

949
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,240
those rules you're going to own that

950
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,519
game

951
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,798
but do it legally not with corrupt

952
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:36,240
lobbyists but

953
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:37,918
absolute honor to share what i knew with

954
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,919
you sorry for being offensive but like i

955
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,480
said this is what we've done what we do

956
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,679
and i'm not guessing so absolute honor

957
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,059
everyone thank you and wish you the best

958
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:50,259
of luck nick easily

959
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:50,259
[Music]

960
