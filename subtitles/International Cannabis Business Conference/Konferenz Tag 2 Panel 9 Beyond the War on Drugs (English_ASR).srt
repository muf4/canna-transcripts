1
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:07,379
hello

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,359
um so hi everybody uh my name is Stephen

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,839
Murphy and um we have

4
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:19,618
30 minutes to solve Global cannabis and

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,079
regulations which is should be doable

6
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:23,160
on a Friday Friday evening

7
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,919
um

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,259
look the the I think it's very nice to

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,240
be able to talk about Beyond The War of

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,480
drugs and to kind of you know one

11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:36,058
recognize the the impact that has been

12
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:38,039
made in the last seven years especially

13
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:42,119
coming out of of North America which is

14
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:44,640
now transferring over to Europe but you

15
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:48,419
know we're in a

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,939
crazy young industry which we are kind

17
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,280
of to use an analogy we're flying a

18
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:54,359
plane with both hands tied behind our

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,420
backs

20
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:59,359
um look there is there is a recent you

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,039
know there's a recent major U.N report

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,558
that came out during the week which you

23
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:08,460
know called for an end of the end of the

24
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:11,819
war on drugs and it sounds great and it

25
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:15,419
sounds super super positive but

26
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:18,179
really when you translate the the the

27
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,640
the social mission of ending the War on

28
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,118
Drugs into the reality of conducting

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,299
business and and actually working to

30
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:30,420
bring a business face to drugs and make

31
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:33,000
it more uh agreeable and certainly

32
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,299
certainly more professional like how

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,500
would we talk to uh conscious conscious

34
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,540
investment

35
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,478
how do you do that how do you how do you

36
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,520
put a how how do you get investors

37
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,200
excited about ending the war on drugs

38
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:47,219
and that part of the story for

39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,859
businesses

40
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:51,359
uh maybe maybe Aaron if you want to if

41
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:53,219
you want to kick it off

42
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,140
yeah thank you I you know I think we

43
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:57,719
really it's it's all about lining

44
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,200
aligning self-interest with with the

45
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,819
cause of of ending prohibition and

46
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,659
um you know with what we're seeing in in

47
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:09,659
across the country is this emerging

48
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:11,219
emergent legal cannabis industry that

49
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:13,259
um you know investors are seeing just

50
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:15,900
seeing like as an opportunity like any

51
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:17,878
other opportunity and so you know what

52
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,379
we're you know the kind of the Gospel we

53
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:21,959
preach is that if you're invested in

54
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:23,759
this industry then you are an advocate

55
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,520
and you must invest in the federal

56
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:28,560
policy or state federal now

57
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,200
International policy reforms necessary

58
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:35,280
for the industry to prosper

59
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:37,619
yeah I mean I I would add to that that

60
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,719
there's not always an alignment between

61
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,439
the the self-interest of a particular

62
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:47,219
business and good policy so if you know

63
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:49,560
I am uh Joe's Mega Corp

64
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:52,139
um I want Joe's Mega Corp to have

65
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,140
Monopoly on cannabis which is terrible

66
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,759
policy so there's what I notice is that

67
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:58,859
there's friction

68
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:01,378
um with you know especially like the the

69
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,019
larger companies larger investors with

70
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:06,419
wanting to have market dominance

71
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:09,000
um versus what I think I would argue

72
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:11,818
many would argue uh is better policy

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,759
which is an ecosystem of lots of smaller

74
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:17,219
businesses that are doing things

75
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:19,859
conscientiously are paying attention to

76
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:21,719
like environmental considerations uh

77
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:26,180
Equity considerations things of that

78
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:28,378
nature so I I think the the initial

79
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,180
legalization effort and whatever country

80
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:33,239
we're talking about

81
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,780
um yeah you can get uh investors behind

82
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,900
that concept if if I want to be in the

83
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,759
Cannabis space I it has to be legal in

84
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,799
order for me to invest

85
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,179
um if I have you know a bank that's

86
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,819
going to finance that that's going to be

87
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,680
a variable issue in different places

88
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:52,259
um if I have to answer to shareholders

89
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,819
or a board of directors you know those

90
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:57,239
fundamental issues of legality are

91
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:59,479
threshold issues but once you get past

92
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,280
that threshold issue of legalization

93
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:03,719
then you know it becomes more

94
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,019
complicated and what that legalization

95
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:08,400
looks like itself also can become very

96
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,080
complicated and that's where you end up

97
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,459
with like a lot of like limited markets

98
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,860
we see this a lot in the states

99
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,719
particularly on the East Coast where

100
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,939
there is you know a set number of

101
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:20,819
licenses and what you have there

102
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:22,500
typically are like the publicly traded

103
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:23,939
companies that are publicly traded in

104
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,819
Canada because they're not allowed to be

105
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:29,399
publicly traded in the U.S that dominate

106
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:32,399
these markets and then the way that that

107
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:34,198
translates to the consumer is not very

108
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,138
many options and not very many

109
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:40,080
especially good options so they go to

110
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:42,360
their local cannabis store and they have

111
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:45,000
the options of like five different

112
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,639
things that are in 20 different jars and

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,279
it's all pretty gross so it's it's it's

114
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,660
not exactly lined up very easily I don't

115
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:53,359
think

116
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,199
foreign

117
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,080
for that one

118
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,960
wow you guys really nailed it I I think

119
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:04,198
that what's lost here in

120
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,839
um making something that is a magical

121
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:09,840
mystical

122
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:12,239
unexplained ethereal plant medicine into

123
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:15,418
a consumer package good for capitalism

124
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,759
there's a natural disconnect and I think

125
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:20,399
that the the people that I've seen do

126
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,680
the most well business-wise success wise

127
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,779
in California have been the ones that

128
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,879
bake in a triple bottom line where they

129
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:30,138
know that love is lucrative

130
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:32,819
turnover in companies lack of loyalty

131
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:35,460
boof but you know bad bad quality

132
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:37,439
products there's proof of concept

133
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:39,299
there's data that shows that that does

134
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,180
not scale markets that does not welcome

135
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,220
new users that does not bring Innovation

136
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,280
and polish and sophistication to the

137
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,479
space and so we we have proof that shows

138
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,079
that if you don't invest in your people

139
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:53,159
and the industry people like ncia Aaron

140
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,258
you know works with the national

141
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,820
cannabis industry Association you know

142
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:58,439
ask yourselves are you part of a Trade

143
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:00,719
Organization are you talking to each

144
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:03,000
other what happened in California we

145
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,360
fought like cats and dogs in front of

146
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,579
the state capital in front of the the

147
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,600
federal capital and they looked at us of

148
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:11,399
course they're going to go with big

149
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,139
Pharma and big Ag and big tobacco

150
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,000
because we weren't on the same page

151
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,259
before we showed up we didn't have

152
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,360
common language about what

153
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:20,100
sustainability meant for us and the

154
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,740
people that are doing the best in the

155
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,840
Bay Area in LA in California are people

156
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,360
who are giving back when we use the word

157
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:29,219
Equity we have a very uh in the United

158
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,199
States because of our history with

159
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,300
slavery and institutionalized racism and

160
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,100
racist uh policy we have what's called

161
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,900
an equity program so you might hear us

162
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,580
talking about it a little bit what we

163
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:40,079
did was we put people of color and

164
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:41,879
people from communities that were most

165
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,939
highly policed by the war on drugs and

166
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,560
by police first in line to get licensing

167
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:47,519
I'm in New Jersey they have really

168
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,720
unique

169
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,519
um you know structures where they're

170
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,979
actually getting business training

171
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:55,439
they're getting uh good loans good rates

172
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:57,000
on loans they're getting deals on you

173
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,519
know rent things that are are really

174
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,740
barriers to entry to acknowledge that

175
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,959
they have you know 400 years of being

176
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,180
treated like sub-human beings and they

177
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,379
deserve a step up because many of their

178
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,660
communities have been destroyed by the

179
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:11,639
War on Drugs not only from policing but

180
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,220
from the fact that most you know black

181
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,840
fathers in urban centers are in prison

182
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,699
those are all black children that are

183
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,918
now being raised in the hood without any

184
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,840
support so the War on Drugs has

185
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:23,698
incredible implications that do mess

186
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,339
with the economy that do destabilize

187
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,660
spaces and make cities unsafe so these

188
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:30,719
are the things that we try to talk about

189
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,460
to these msos or to you know Joe

190
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,620
corporation that don't know why it's

191
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:37,019
important to care about it they if you

192
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,120
don't actively have in your Marketing in

193
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:41,939
your budget in your community and in

194
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,519
your Staffing an acknowledgment of the

195
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:47,038
the underlying racism and the underlying

196
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:48,779
sexism and greed capitalism that has

197
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,339
pushed us to where we are now you

198
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:52,079
actually won't do well

199
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:54,538
um it hasn't really worked to be

200
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:57,060
unabashedly greedy in the space we don't

201
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:59,038
like it as consumers as B2B and in

202
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,199
general the world is moving towards more

203
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,639
conscious capitalism so we got to be on

204
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,199
the right side of that

205
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:09,120
like I I totally buy into you know

206
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,759
social equity and Equity programs and

207
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,978
that being critical parts of the theory

208
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,720
well well the the reality is very

209
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:17,879
different the reality and implementation

210
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,319
of us is exceptionally different let's

211
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,478
mess it up by the way we didn't do a

212
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,280
good job at this it's an idea well we're

213
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:26,519
talking about it but but it's also

214
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,318
for a company who is who's trying to you

215
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:30,719
know operate within the business and

216
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,180
then the challenges of of running a

217
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,639
business day to day with the additional

218
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,399
tasks of you know supporting a

219
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:40,918
membership and that membership you know

220
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:43,200
uh like just a constant like you know

221
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:45,899
pushing a hill up or pushing a rock up

222
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,200
the hill like how do you how you've

223
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,940
you've seen you've been scarred by what

224
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,420
is you know what is a David versus

225
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:57,120
Goliath task of of not only pushing you

226
00:08:54,419 --> 00:09:00,360
know pushing cannabis forward in in in

227
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,600
the US but doing so with so many vested

228
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:07,440
parties who want to see cannabis

229
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:11,040
ultimately fail like how do you convince

230
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,140
companies to really Embrace that like

231
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,360
what's what what what's your message for

232
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:17,338
them well I mean I think in the U.S

233
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,860
we've evolved over time where there

234
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:22,080
isn't there isn't uh the kind of the

235
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,060
boogeyman of big Pharma and tobacco

236
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,980
really actively lobbying against

237
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:28,619
cannabis not to say that they don't have

238
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,420
interests that are that are you know in

239
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,480
opposition to ours but it's not a

240
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:35,939
priority the problem that we have is

241
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,240
that the industry itself especially you

242
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,880
know the small operators are not

243
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,278
investing in the policy reforms that

244
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:46,080
that are needed and so you know what's

245
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:48,899
what's really important isn't to Joe's

246
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,839
point is that you know we can have we we

247
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:54,778
can make this look really bad by having

248
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,720
one or two of the largest companies push

249
00:09:54,778 --> 00:10:00,299
through National reforms that that are

250
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,980
favorable to them and no one else uh but

251
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:03,539
what you know what the message that we

252
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,980
have out there is that there is an

253
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:07,439
alternative to that which is making sure

254
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,080
that the small businesses have a voice

255
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,000
making sure that we're we're you know

256
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,278
creating a policy landscape that you

257
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,919
know that raises all you know the the

258
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:19,320
that raises All Ships uh and ensures

259
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:21,000
that you know we have we have an open

260
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,080
and inclusive Market

261
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,820
um and that's you know that's what we do

262
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,080
as an association is represent the small

263
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,660
businesses

264
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,700
um but you know I don't I think that you

265
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:32,579
know you're going to see yes we're going

266
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,200
to see big big Pharma and alcohol and

267
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,399
tobacco they're already playing in this

268
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,320
space

269
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:39,778
um but there's room for you know for

270
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,060
craft cannabis as well well I I think

271
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:44,458
it's not as much oppositional I think

272
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:46,319
that they seek to co-opt it

273
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:49,439
um I I think that you know there

274
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,500
certainly is investments from Big Pharma

275
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,380
and big tobacco into cannabis just not

276
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,720
in a way that is conducive to having a

277
00:10:55,379 --> 00:11:00,720
healthy cannabis industry and in a way

278
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:04,259
that's beneficial to Consumers it is uh

279
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,200
with the sole focus of driving uh

280
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:10,919
revenues to shareholders and and you

281
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,200
know not ideologically aligned with you

282
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:15,479
know the this this plant that is

283
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,060
beneficial and helps people

284
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,560
therapeutically and you know should not

285
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:21,119
be criminalized and I think to your

286
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:23,578
earlier question

287
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,919
um the War on Drugs is an awful thing I

288
00:11:23,578 --> 00:11:28,199
spent a lot of my career in the trenches

289
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:30,958
combating the War on Drugs Case by case

290
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,519
and I've seen how bad it is on families

291
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,859
and communities firsthand the

292
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,000
legalization of cannabis does not fix

293
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,800
that

294
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,120
um and you know what what Luna was

295
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:44,578
describing was that we had decided you

296
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,519
know starting in California but exported

297
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:49,919
to other states in the U.S to try to

298
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,339
rectify the harms of the War on Drugs by

299
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:55,679
providing preferential treatment to

300
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:59,040
applicants in local Municipal permitting

301
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:01,859
and the the reality which you would

302
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:04,679
think is obvious but is lost upon many

303
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:07,019
cities and counties and states is that

304
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:09,719
giving someone beneficial treatment in a

305
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:12,360
permitting process does not correct the

306
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,120
the generational harms to Society of the

307
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,600
War on Drugs but okay so

308
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,720
like you're you running you know running

309
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,120
running a compliant business great you

310
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,440
want to have a very strong social Equity

311
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,000
Mission like you know I don't think

312
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:33,000
anybody is is in cannabis you know well

313
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,919
you know for for for the wrong reasons

314
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
it's really it's it's you I just imagine

315
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,659
there's a lot of people in there for the

316
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,659
wrong reasons no

317
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:43,620
like when you realize you actually have

318
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:46,439
to work hard like it scares a lot of

319
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,299
people but like once you get over that

320
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,339
shock of okay it's this isn't going to

321
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:53,639
be easy you know the the the the the the

322
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:56,940
the the true the the truth green people

323
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:59,278
come out and it's you know it's it's a

324
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,720
case of you want to you're in the

325
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,100
industry because you think this is

326
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,240
something that can change the world and

327
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,500
change the world in a very you know

328
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,600
doesn't have the solutions to absolutely

329
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,700
everything but but but no one puts money

330
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,620
behind it to Aaron's point if you're

331
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,060
being regulated to death why would you

332
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,980
spend ten thousand dollars a year to

333
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:15,419
have them Lobby for you it's the

334
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,039
self-fulfilling prophecy no one has the

335
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:19,199
money to lobby and we don't have money

336
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,059
because we have bad policy sure but but

337
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,259
you've got so you've you've got federal

338
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:28,799
policy which is is is is one thing but

339
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:32,519
maybe is there any policy that you have

340
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:35,819
seen that has has enhanced or certainly

341
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:38,519
been more favorable to find somewhat of

342
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,139
the balance because you have to like I

343
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,639
think a lot of people sitting here last

344
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:43,379
year were licking their lips on the

345
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:45,120
thought of of adult use cannabis in

346
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:47,278
Germany I need to see it being more

347
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,539
watered down than than ever and that's

348
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,278
going to happen you know that's going to

349
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:52,019
happen time and again this is uh you

350
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:54,419
know this is as everybody says this is a

351
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:56,278
marathon not a Sprint but there are

352
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:58,860
policies that are being designed in

353
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:01,200
certain states that are

354
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,159
are finding are trying to find that

355
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,860
balance

356
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:08,039
no one has done it right I I think that

357
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,899
I can look at at globally every

358
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:12,299
jurisdiction that has sought out

359
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:14,039
legalization has done a lot of things

360
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:17,099
wrong I think that they're I would

361
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:20,219
invert that and say that there are are

362
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,740
bright spots in different areas where we

363
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,740
should replicate certain elements of

364
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:28,139
policy and deploy those and kind of

365
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:33,060
Frankenstein it in other areas so for

366
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:35,820
example Amsterdam Amsterdam is is the

367
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:39,899
thought leader on this issue

368
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:42,839
um going back to the 1970s and there's a

369
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:44,940
lot wrong with how the the Netherlands

370
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,279
and and I say Amsterdam because you know

371
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:51,000
in large part more broadly in the

372
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:53,039
Netherlands cannabis isn't as well

373
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,019
tolerated as it is in Amsterdam

374
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,480
especially more recently with you know

375
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:59,519
the government there but point being the

376
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,519
the social consumption aspect of coffee

377
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:06,000
shops and being able to go to a business

378
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:08,578
and consume cannabis and hang out is

379
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,740
something that's special and unique and

380
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:13,679
is not replicated in most other places

381
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:16,259
if you look in the U.S by and large the

382
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:18,059
model is an off sale model like what you

383
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:20,100
would get going to like a liquor store

384
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:23,039
you go and buy your product you take it

385
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:28,379
home and consume it and that is not

386
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:32,099
adequate for for society to destigmatize

387
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:33,958
this product however what they do poorly

388
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,079
in the Netherlands is that the supply

389
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:38,819
chain is not legalized or regulated and

390
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:41,939
so then you have this sort of like

391
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:44,699
illicit supply chain that feeds into a

392
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,980
quasi-legal model and it can never

393
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:50,278
really become mature and it's just

394
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:54,240
stymied as it has been for the last 50

395
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:59,338
years or so in California one of the

396
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:02,159
things that we did there that I I don't

397
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:06,600
know whether or not it can be successful

398
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:08,819
is we do not limit the supply side the

399
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,920
production side so there's no limitation

400
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,839
by the state of California for how many

401
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:15,360
cultivation licenses there can be or not

402
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,980
be ideologically I thought out of the

403
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,079
gate that's a good thing let's let's

404
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,720
allow business to do what business does

405
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:24,059
the better businesses will out-compete

406
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,920
the worst businesses and you know

407
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:28,979
through this process like what we see

408
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:30,778
with other Industries we will see you

409
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,399
know the good businesses rise to the top

410
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:35,100
and they will get the market dominance

411
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,740
but what has happened is that we've had

412
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:40,320
a massive oversupply problem and and

413
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,778
because we have created a system there

414
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,379
where we allow for some municipalities

415
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:48,659
to legalize and others to prohibit in

416
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:51,480
California still several years after

417
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:54,299
legalization more than 65 percent of the

418
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,920
State of California is does not allow

419
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:58,439
for legal cannabis for commercial

420
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:01,319
cannabis and so then what you have is

421
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:04,980
this massive oversupply that gets

422
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,298
funneled into to a uh to the retailer

423
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:09,000
where there's there's just not enough

424
00:17:06,298 --> 00:17:11,099
retail availability for a consumers so

425
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,558
consumers go to the illicit Market they

426
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:15,539
go back to their dealer and amongst

427
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:16,678
other things that local dealer the

428
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:18,659
person that they've known that living

429
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:20,400
room they've gone to whatever they don't

430
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,319
pay huge taxes

431
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,059
they don't have all those added expenses

432
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,578
which makes the legal cannabis

433
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:28,500
businesses ironically less competitive

434
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:31,019
than the Legacy folks that never

435
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:34,679
bothered with legalization to begin with

436
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:36,720
so it's it's complicated but what I

437
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,880
would say is that you can look at some

438
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,259
things about how California has done it

439
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,340
you can look at some things about how

440
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,440
Canada has done it one of the things

441
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:45,599
that Canada has done well is federal

442
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,298
legalization for all of the problems

443
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,339
with Canada of which there are many and

444
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:52,379
I would say that the industry there is

445
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:54,058
largely been a failure at least there's

446
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,220
Federal legalization and you can import

447
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:58,918
export in and out of Canada and you can

448
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,600
have access to Banking and and that is

449
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:02,700
something that is special so if we look

450
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:05,699
at sort of this like Frankenstein

451
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,620
approach we could imagine a model where

452
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:10,380
there are you know there's a federal

453
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:12,239
level of legalization uh there is the

454
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,940
ability for the consumer to go to a

455
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,038
place and consume and there are some

456
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,940
guard rails in the supply chain to

457
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:22,859
ensure both that there is not fully an

458
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,600
oversupply which I think that there's

459
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:27,000
some larger debate there that we don't

460
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:28,678
have time for now while ensuring that

461
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,960
the point of access for the consumers

462
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:33,720
Isn't So unduly restricted that people

463
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,340
are basically compelled to go to the

464
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,220
illicit Market in order to have access

465
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:39,839
to Canvas OR like in uh in Australia

466
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,640
where I've heard that if you get caught

467
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:42,839
driving they can take your light with

468
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,400
cannabis in your system they can take

469
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:46,500
your license and it puts the license of

470
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,298
the prescribing doctor at risk so then

471
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,619
there's also the implementation that the

472
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:51,480
devil's in the details a lot of times

473
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:53,339
something I want people to realize too

474
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,500
as we're talking about this the word

475
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:57,480
legalization doesn't mean anything don't

476
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,339
use it you're either talking about

477
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,919
decriminalization

478
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:03,538
or tax control and regulate

479
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,700
because when in California they thought

480
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:07,019
they were legalizing they or then they

481
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,860
voted yes they thought they were

482
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:14,160
decriminalizing it for for possession

483
00:19:09,859 --> 00:19:16,558
use transport cultivation what we were

484
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,360
actually voting for was the consumer

485
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:19,918
package good model that was sold through

486
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:22,500
license dispensaries through the state

487
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,080
so there's two things happening here

488
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,700
you've got Portugal you know Uruguay is

489
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:28,798
really interesting example the question

490
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,480
is is are we talking about is it good

491
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:34,200
for business or is it good for the plant

492
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,779
and medicine and medical sovereignty and

493
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:40,080
human rights sometimes they're not odds

494
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:42,298
right yeah yeah but I suppose this is

495
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,720
this has to be kind of a universal

496
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:47,400
conversation this is you know where

497
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,839
we're closer getting close to 80

498
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,419
countries around the world with some

499
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:53,519
sort of legal framework for access to

500
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:56,700
cannabis predominantly medical and

501
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:59,058
that's not including the US like you

502
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:02,100
know there's there's

503
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:05,160
every day there's some a fresh wave of

504
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:08,538
optimism for federal legalization only

505
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:12,419
to be jammed back in the can

506
00:20:08,538 --> 00:20:15,779
that's that's there there needs to be a

507
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:19,020
major Domino to fall uh it's you know

508
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:21,240
it's not going to be the EU because

509
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:24,019
they you know they're not prepared to

510
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:28,019
kind of rule on something so significant

511
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:31,500
it's highly unlikely to be the US so

512
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:34,980
it's essentially going to be a mishmash

513
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:37,500
of federal of federal policies or you

514
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:41,120
know International policies for each

515
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:45,720
jurisdiction do you see any sort of

516
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:48,479
Juicy kind of or suspect any change

517
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,160
within the federal system uh for for the

518
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,640
next five years because that's you know

519
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,200
that's the global Domino yeah in the US

520
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,640
I mean all of the action has been at the

521
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,380
state level and I you know I'd argue

522
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,320
there's been some some positive to that

523
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:03,360
is that it probably has is kept uh has

524
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:04,379
kept the big big tobacco a big Pharma at

525
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,079
Bay

526
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,360
um but you know I think that in terms of

527
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:11,279
of seeing you know full regulation and

528
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:12,899
control like alcohol at the federal

529
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:14,399
level in the United States that's still

530
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,259
more than five years out that's five or

531
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,679
ten years out there's a lot of factors

532
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:21,298
on where you know who's elected and a

533
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,480
lot of you know factors that are in play

534
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:26,220
to you know make that prediction but I

535
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,740
do think what we will see in the near

536
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,720
term will be uh what is called in our

537
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:33,419
U.S law rescheduling of cannabis kind of

538
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,400
a medicalization uh that could provide

539
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:37,799
it'll it'll provide some relief for the

540
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,179
industry on on some levels but it comes

541
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:42,839
with a whole other host of regulations

542
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:44,880
it would not affect international trade

543
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:47,279
in any way you know most of our industry

544
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,039
will still be out of compliance with

545
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,960
federal law for quite some time but

546
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:54,720
that's probably that's probably going to

547
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,419
be the next you know Big Move uh short

548
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:01,440
of of other you know in terms of larger

549
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:03,120
uh policy reform nationally in the U.S

550
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,519
I'm seeing people really looking

551
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:08,519
re-looking at their license caps I think

552
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:10,200
that we've seen that limited licensing

553
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:11,759
is a real problem

554
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,620
um to the point we just heard I think

555
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,298
that this is one of the most important

556
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:17,519
things is you know letting business do

557
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:20,158
what it does part of that is allowing

558
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:22,500
you know not bottlenecking so I think

559
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,600
that having I mean the biggest thing is

560
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,298
is we were the consultants for the city

561
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:29,219
in the state when we were trying to push

562
00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:30,900
these things through in Oakland they

563
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,940
didn't know their own laws they did we

564
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,960
had to tell them how business worked we

565
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,058
were just talking in the Green Room

566
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,380
about a lot of these policy makers and

567
00:22:36,058 --> 00:22:39,418
legislators they don't have experience

568
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,820
in business they don't understand what

569
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:43,380
an implementation of a business plan

570
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:45,240
um what you know shareholders like the

571
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,799
pressures they don't know what you know

572
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,259
the devil ends up being in the details

573
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:51,480
so being at the table knowing who these

574
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:53,158
people are is what I would recommend I

575
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,038
was on a first name basis with all of my

576
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:58,200
my city council members my district

577
00:22:56,038 --> 00:23:00,119
um Representatives they knew me they

578
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,340
knew my crew they knew our argument we

579
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:03,599
showed up we did clean cleanups in the

580
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:06,119
community to show that cannabis was

581
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:08,038
giving back we donated in Berkeley we

582
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:09,899
were giving money to the libraries and

583
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:13,200
the schools way before we legalized this

584
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,400
was pre-tax control regulate and when

585
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,080
the cops would have an issue where we

586
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,700
would have someone break in the school

587
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,019
teachers and the Librarians would show

588
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,340
up at these city council and saying

589
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:21,779
actually these people are contributing

590
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:23,519
and they would show up for us and fight

591
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:25,619
for us so I think that there's a little

592
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:27,179
bit of of you know making sure that you

593
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:29,579
know who these people are that they know

594
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:31,740
you in Brazil you will go to a judge and

595
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:33,899
ask their permission to grow cannabis

596
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:36,240
imagine the societal change when the

597
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,880
judge class which skews typically more

598
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,740
wealthy more educated more Elite are

599
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,059
hearing hundreds of testimonials a day

600
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,919
about why someone needs their medicine

601
00:23:42,058 --> 00:23:45,839
this is the thing that's going to change

602
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,038
hearts and Minds it's not going to be in

603
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,099
the data it's not going to be in the

604
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,538
money you can't quantify magic and you

605
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:53,639
can't can't quantify a community

606
00:23:51,538 --> 00:23:54,599
building and what this plant does and I

607
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,460
think that that's the most important

608
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,980
thing is we're not loud enough as

609
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,779
consumers as business people we are not

610
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,099
working hard enough on the policy side

611
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:04,379
because we're so big busy with our

612
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:06,599
packaging our branding our social media

613
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,640
content our personal laundry and

614
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:09,839
relationships if we have a life so I

615
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,000
think we need to put a lot more energy

616
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:13,319
what I noticed in California is when we

617
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
were at the City Council meetings it was

618
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:16,259
just business owners there weren't many

619
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,839
consumers there weren't many other

620
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:20,400
people arguing and as a policy maker if

621
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:22,139
you see business people arguing for

622
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,400
themselves you just imagine that they're

623
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,600
greedy and they just want what they want

624
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,460
in their own business interests they

625
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:28,019
didn't realize we want the movement we

626
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,179
want medical safe access and

627
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:32,279
recreational access so who are you

628
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:34,380
talking to do they know you are you at

629
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:37,079
the table to tell them how you want it

630
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:39,840
done because trying to undo and fix bad

631
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:42,000
policy is way harder more stressful more

632
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,879
expensive than baking it into the DNA

633
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,079
from day one and there's a saying either

634
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,760
you're at the table or you're on the

635
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:51,658
venue facts

636
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:53,279
um and I would say so I was I was doing

637
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:55,740
parallel things to all the things that

638
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,538
you just described and you know sitting

639
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,279
here all these years later today it

640
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:01,798
didn't make a damn bit of difference the

641
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:04,079
businesses that were there that were or

642
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:05,819
Champions that time they're gone they

643
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,319
don't exist and the reason why they're

644
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:09,359
gone they don't exist and why it didn't

645
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:11,639
matter is uh because there's over

646
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,199
taxation amongst other things and this

647
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,900
is something that I think if we have a

648
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,940
takeaway to impart on you know the

649
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,580
people here and on policy makers in

650
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:23,038
Germany and other places it's to not

651
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:26,278
look at cannabis as being a cash cow

652
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:28,500
cannabis is it's it's not going to solve

653
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:31,019
a budget it's it can't be over taxed

654
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,179
it's don't look at cannabis as providing

655
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:35,700
any more Revenue than any other business

656
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:38,038
in any other industry in any other place

657
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,019
it it won't do that it's not going to

658
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,058
fix these larger problems it's not going

659
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:44,339
to fix the War on Drugs it's not going

660
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:47,278
to it's not gonna fix like larger

661
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:50,278
epistemic things that have larger

662
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:54,720
epistemic problems so what it is is it's

663
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:58,259
an opportunity to end in abysmal and

664
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,538
immoral policy of what we call the War

665
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:02,940
on Drugs to incarcerate people for a

666
00:26:00,538 --> 00:26:04,859
beneficial plant that helps them and

667
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,558
doesn't hurt anyone that's never killed

668
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:10,558
anyone ever in the history of humanity

669
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:12,538
has never caused a single death

670
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:16,139
that's all we're looking to do we're

671
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:18,538
we're looking to just fix that wrong and

672
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,520
allow businesses to succeed and to allow

673
00:26:18,538 --> 00:26:23,038
people to use it and to use it fairly

674
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:25,859
and reasonably freely and the the model

675
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:27,179
that I think if we're looking at it one

676
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:30,538
of the things that we haven't talked a

677
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:32,759
lot about is the beverage model I what I

678
00:26:30,538 --> 00:26:35,099
think is going to work the best for

679
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:37,798
cannabis is essentially what we see

680
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:40,139
working for wine it's there's a lot of

681
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:42,000
parallels there and in your home country

682
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,980
when you think about how is wine

683
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,200
regulated where can I access it how much

684
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,298
does it cost what's required in order to

685
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,460
get into the business extrapolate that

686
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:52,798
into cannabis there's a way to do that

687
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,778
and I think that you know just in how

688
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:56,639
we're having this conversation and we've

689
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:59,579
been in the trenches since the beginning

690
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,159
we have a lot of Battle Scars here we

691
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:04,859
have been through it all and it can be

692
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,260
absolutely awful and we can tell you a

693
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:08,959
lot more of what not to do than what to

694
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:11,640
do don't do what we did in California

695
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,679
don't do what we do in America don't do

696
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,960
what has been done in Canada the first

697
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,538
model for legalization in Germany was

698
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,278
there was it was going to lead to

699
00:27:18,538 --> 00:27:22,619
Monopoly and it's not a bad thing that

700
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:24,900
that didn't pass so I think that there

701
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:27,000
is just an opportunity here for

702
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:29,820
re-examination of a fundamental policy

703
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,519
issue and to think about what can we do

704
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:35,879
in order to make uh businesses

705
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:37,740
successful to give some benefit to

706
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,419
communities and allow for safe access

707
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,640
those are really the only things that

708
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:43,740
are going to be accomplished well if we

709
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,480
accomplish those alone that's still

710
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,700
something pretty significant and then

711
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,860
and then it comes down to judging well

712
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,960
what is what is winning the war on drugs

713
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:55,798
and what does that look like because I

714
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:58,860
think if people want everything it's not

715
00:27:55,798 --> 00:28:01,619
achievable but uh I think that wraps it

716
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:02,959
up if I yeah yeah the flashing red

717
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:05,399
lights
