1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,729
you know it's about two years ago that

2
00:00:02,428 --> 00:00:07,470
everybody was talking about the big CPG

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,000
companies entering the space and they're

4
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:10,949
going through Canada and they figure out

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,710
how to get in the United States and it

6
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:15,359
was really less than a year ago that one

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,850
of the Canadian companies bought one of

8
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,189
the larger or didn't buy they tied up

9
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:23,100

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,390

12
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:29,518

somebody that when we first got into the

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,760
space was kind of like a rock star we

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,609
used to listen to his podcast every week

32
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,310
yeah anyway he was it was it's neat to

33
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:17,129
be still here with him seven years later

34
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,170
almost so anyway my name is Emily paksy

35
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:21,658
a co-founder managing partner Poseidon

36
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,250
we have two investment funds dedicated

37
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,950
to the cannabis industry we launched our

38
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,868
first fund in January of 2014 alongside

39
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,990
the opening of the Colorado adult use

40
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:33,299
market and it's been an incredible

41
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:36,390
experience from that point forward we've

42
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,640
invested in the US Canada Europe Mexico

43
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,329
and Colombia and we launched our second

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,280
fund in September of 2018 that fund is

45
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:46,379
very focused on just Series A or later

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,719
stage private companies and it was kind

47
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:51,390
of where we noticed a gap in the funding

48
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,578
space when everyone was to Alan's point

49
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,968
earlier just kind of focusing on this RT

50
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:59,609
o IPO process in in the MS o category

51
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:01,199
and so we always have found that we do

52
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:03,420
really well when we place investments

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,350
where the crowds aren't running so

54
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:10,979
that's our second fund ir kaufman chief

55
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:13,469
revenue officer of dama financial by way

56
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,270
of background dhamma provides the critic

57
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:16,740
financial infrastructure that the

58
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,689
industry needs to be able to operate

59
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,120
just like it were a non cannabis related

60
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:23,639
business to of co-founders come from

61
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,890
banking and payments backgrounds took to

62
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:27,119
companies public in that space but the

63
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:28,619
important thing to note is that one of

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,539
the fundamental value propositions of

65
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,849
both of those companies was moving a

66
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:34,349
cash based economy to a banked and

67
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:36,389
digital economy and that's all we're

68
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:38,430
doing here and so what we set out to do

69
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:40,289
was provide them a solution to the most

70
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,930
pressing need which was a bank account

71
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:44,849

139
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:14,759
did we slowed off that portfolio then it

140
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,860
came to the candidate space because you

141
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,050
know I came in as an investor because

142
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,759
there's tons of opportunity and then I

143
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,139
ran into Bob Hoeven and he sucked me

144
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,538
into hope and Law Group

145

want to start with you Emily cuz I know

155
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,908
you have the right perspective here

156
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:49,228
about the before and the after but how

157
00:05:47,908 --> 00:05:53,009
have things been changing from your

158
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:55,348
perspective when it comes to M&amp;A so

159
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:57,750
we've seen a couple this whole industry

160
00:05:55,348 --> 00:05:59,279
has been going through a few cycles and

161
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,228
it really depends on a couple of things

162
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,209
it's been a catalyst driven industry for

163
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:04,918
sure and the way that capital flows on

164
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:06,329
the back end of a catalyst is really

165
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:08,848
it's really interesting to observe and

166
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:11,579
it's important to consider the first

167
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:13,709
wave of M&amp;A that we were seeing really

168
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:16,288
take place last year or was it yeah

169
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:18,719
about last year we were seeing MSOs

170
00:06:16,288 --> 00:06:21,509
purchasing product companies was a big

171
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,310
one I would say at that time capital was

172
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:25,740
flowing very well into that space

173
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,199
because people perceived it to be liquid

174
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,079
space and that there is a premium for

175
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,770
liquidity a lot of the time in this

176
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,269
especially when you're talking about

177
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:35,579
people who are thinking about how do I

178
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:35,949
maximize a return in a short period of

179
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:39,069
time

180
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:41,110
so we saw some of the acquisitions going

181
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:43,449
on with some of those product companies

182
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:46,830
that I would consider to be a pretty

183
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:48,969
frothy valuations pretty high multiples

184
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:51,939
traditionally speaking branded products

185
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:53,710
don't command a very high multiple but

186
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:55,449
in these instances it was kind of a land

187
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:57,399
grab and people were doing it and it was

188
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:59,319
driving stock prices up it was it was an

189
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:01,329
opportunity to really create more

190
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,949
attention around the companies and so

191
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:05,649
that was really driving it and then what

192
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:06,909
we saw was what I'm kind of we call it

193
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:08,409
kind of the Darwin phase or The

194
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:10,060
Reckoning where people are starting to

195
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,670
actually pay attention to business

196
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:14,829
fundamentals if you can imagine that I'm

197
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:17,560
so thinking about things like revenue

198
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:19,240
growth of Revenue eBay da all of these

199
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,319
factors that really indicate the health

200
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,230
of a business not just press piece at

201
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:27,490
that point we started to see more

202
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,319
scrutiny about what people were paying

203
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,300
for these companies and the way that

204
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:33,219
these mergers were occurring or these

205
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,410
acquisitions were occurring and so now

206
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:38,110
it's a different time where we're seeing

207
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:40,300
the multiples come way way down we're

208
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,610
seeing mergers starting to happen

209
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,079
because it's basically too many people

210
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,090
trying to do the same thing in the same

211
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,740
market and so a lot of people are trying

212
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:49,810
to think about how do we go through a

213
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,120
one plus one equals three scenario where

214
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:54,280
we can come together consolidate and

215
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,199
streamline our operations and then drive

216
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:58,119
revenue growth more in an exponential

217
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:00,550
way rather than just incremental bumps

218
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,470
so I would say that we moved from a

219
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,819
point of exuberance where it was driving

220
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,980
a lot of attention driving a lot of

221
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:09,129
excitement to now it's almost like a

222
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:11,650
survival part of the M&amp;A space and it is

223
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:15,459
a critical piece to it one thing we're

224
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:18,669
watching for is that let's face it in

225
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:21,039
every maturation of a of an industry not

226
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:23,230
everybody's gonna make it failures of

227
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,610
startups are astronomical in every

228
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,770
single sector that you look at

229
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,120
historically speaking so some companies

230
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:30,219
are not going to make it through this

231
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,990
time and I'm a little bit worried that

232
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,418
we're kind of pushing things together

233
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,700
without contemplating the true upside or

234
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:38,799
a creative value of that just to keep

235
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,300
some of these companies alive and I

236
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,039
think we just have to go through the

237
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,990
painful process if some of them can't

238
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,419
make it and I don't want to see the M&amp;A

239
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:49,799
process just kind of carrying dead

240
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:49,799
weight through into the next cycle

241
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:53,860
so Eric you talked to people all over

242
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,740
the country what is your take on what's

243
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:59,649
going on in M&amp;A right now I echo the

244
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,000
same sentiment I think it's not just the

245
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:03,190
exuberance but the irrational exuberance

246
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,289
has kind of dried up now right I mean

247
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,120
people were we called it dumb money and

248
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:08,769
while we're not directly involved in the

249
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,089
M&amp;A I think we're a little bit ahead of

250
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:11,799
the curve and seeing what's coming down

251
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:14,380
the pike because we're banking the

252
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:16,629
industry so we see when funds go up or

253
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:17,950
down or who's being paid or isn't being

254
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:21,909
paid so we get to see some of these

255
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:24,490
trends before they necessarily rear

256
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:27,189
their head to the to the masses so I

257
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:28,959
also think not just on the investment

258
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,820
side but you saw a lot of businesses get

259
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,399
out over their skis we were talking

260
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,230
about it before I'm a dispensary I'm

261
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:37,659
doing great I'm making money hand over

262
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:39,339
fist I'm really tired of dealing with a

263
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:41,559
distributor or something else you know

264
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:42,970
I'm gonna get into distribution so you

265
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:44,559
get a distribution license you get into

266
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,690
distribution without realizing that it's

267
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,639
a fundamentally different business and

268
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,140
you don't hire or bring on anybody

269
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,028
that's got experience in distribution

270
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:53,708
and then that distribution company

271
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:55,990
actually sinks the Golden Goose which

272
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:57,729
was the dispensary so people kind of

273
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,730
trying to get into every vertical not

274
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:03,220
fully appreciating that they are very

275
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:05,139
different businesses okay I'm gonna come

276
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,450
right back to you but first break can

277
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:08,860
you talk about how things have changed

278
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,540
from your perspective the deals that you

279
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,669
you've seen at home and in terms of

280
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:14,169
amount of cash going in the deals or

281
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:15,789
anything like that that would have

282
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:18,278
changed over the last year or two

283
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:19,929
sure just uh just a couple general

284
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:21,639
trends that we've seen if you look at

285
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:22,929
the number of deals that happened twenty

286
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:25,328
eighteen over twenty nineteen I there

287
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:28,479
was a roughly about 250 deals M&amp;A deals

288
00:10:25,328 --> 00:10:32,198
that were closed in 2018 that's up to

289
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,670
about 300 in 2019 interesting enough

290
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,708
cultivation retail accounted for about

291
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:37,389
50% of those deals which actually kind

292
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:39,189
of makes sense because those are the

293
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:41,409
areas of the market that are getting

294
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,839
most affected by lack of capital and

295
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:45,389
regulatory and uncertainty and so those

296
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,760
are those are kind of the bargain

297
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:50,860
companies right now from another key

298
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:52,120
point is that probably bout two-thirds

299
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,649
of the deals that are getting done are

300
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,970
getting done by public companies that

301
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:56,860
are acquiring companies as opposed to

302
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,690
private deals but we focused primarily

303
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,459
on private deals and we're seeing

304
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,200
definitely the deals are getting

305
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,789
challenging

306
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,020
evaluations are getting challenging

307
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:06,000
we're seeing a lot of companies that

308
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,860
just they weren't set up correctly they

309
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,139
didn't have adequate capital and so

310
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,169
they're effectively they're distressed

311
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:14,789
and so they're not in the best

312
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:18,149
bargaining position you know deal size

313
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:20,789
you know we seen an increase in deal

314
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:22,889
size you know probably our average deal

315
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:24,269
size is probably you know probably two

316
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:26,159
years ago it was in the you know the

317
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:27,269
five to fifteen million dollar range now

318
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,250
we're seeing them in anywhere from

319
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,179
probably the ten to thirty thirty five

320
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,759
million dollar range

321
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:34,559
so definitely an increase in deal size

322
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:37,049
but there's everything seems to be on

323
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,279
pause q4 were definitely slowed I think

324
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:41,009
everyone is just trying to figure out

325
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:42,779
what's going on and then I do think that

326
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:45,059
twenty twenty at some point in time will

327
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:47,389
see increased M&amp;A M&amp;A activity last

328
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:49,500
point that I'll make is with the

329
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:51,029
legality of hemp now we're definitely

330
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,500
seeing more activity on the hemp side in

331
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:54,389
terms of you know folks buying up

332
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,289
cultivation centers to grow hemp

333
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:57,720
farmland

334
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:59,309
excetera in that Katie you already

335
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,230
warned us that you have nothing but bad

336
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:03,989
news to share a bit can you tell us kind

337
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:06,720
of you know how much your business is

338
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,340
picking up from failed M&amp;A I guess it's

339
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,480
really sick business development you

340
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:14,280
guys so you know where is Eric's on the

341
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,740
front end and seeing how the trouble

342
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:20,370
brewing early on I am on the way back

343
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:23,340
end dealing with let's say even a very

344
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:25,799
well formulated M&amp;A transaction where

345
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,950
you know some months later a year later

346
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:30,959
it needs to be unwound because it's now

347
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,150
same reasons we've heard here right that

348
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:36,210
they didn't look into it well enough I

349
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:38,159
see a lot of fights amongst just

350
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:40,139
personality disputes amongst the owners

351
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:45,120
you know these are the sort of like soft

352
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:47,009
things that can't be measured by for

353
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,990
instance you know the lawyer running the

354
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:51,840
numbers right that's totally different

355
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,879
so my business is unfortunately quite

356
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,170
busy and I was just telling these guys

357
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:56,820
in the greenroom I'm having trouble

358
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:59,250
keeping up with the demand which is

359
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,410
really sad and you know for a lot of

360
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,090
these companies you know they do kind of

361
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:04,860
just need to go away but instead of

362
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:07,170
doing so they're you know the distressed

363
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,060
asset trying to find someone to come

364
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:11,919
home you know absorb them and pick them

365
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:13,439
up and make it work and you know

366
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,659
[Music]

367
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,450
tactics at the front lack of

368
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:22,009
understanding of how how much the tax

369
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:24,390
burden from 280e is going to affect you

370
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:26,309
all across the board there's I mean I've

371
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:28,199
seen all the different reasons and and

372
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:30,209
if people are losing their dreams

373
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,830
they're losing their hard work if they

374
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,570
hire the wrong lawyer and they don't

375
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:35,100
negotiate well enough or they don't

376
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,720
understand the transaction they end up

377
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,960
really surprised later and that's that's

378
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,110
not a reason to undo a contract but that

379
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:45,150
doesn't mean people don't try Emily if

380
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,110
we had been sitting here a year ago we

381
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:48,750
probably would have been talking about

382
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,519
all the out-of-state operators publicly

383
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,950
traded especially that we're looking to

384
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:54,240
buy California companies and I'm sure

385
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,320
there's not you're here in the market

386
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,480
you know what's going on there but

387
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,129
what's your outlook for the exit

388
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,100
strategy for I'm sure some of the people

389
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:04,320
in the room here in terms of that exit

390
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,300
strategy in terms of exiting through an

391
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,760
acquisition by them so you know I think

392
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:10,349
that that's still an opportunity that

393
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:13,379
comes down the line I think California

394
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:15,840
has got a ways to go to get sorted it's

395
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:18,240
really hard to be an operator here and I

396
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,800
think egregiously so I think many of the

397
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,870
people in this market have been in it

398
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:23,609
longer than anybody in the industry has

399
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:26,460
been in it because of the nature of how

400
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:28,860
long we've had regulations around

401
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,120
cannabis in California now they looked

402
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,029
at these businesses looked very

403
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,830
different once upon a time but it's it's

404
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:37,079
been so incredibly difficult and the

405
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,389
taxes are so incredibly challenging and

406
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,610
and then you had all these resources

407
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:42,929
pushing people into the illicit market

408
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,029
which is basically the biggest

409
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:48,120
competitor for a regulated business and

410
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:50,879
that's it's just unfortunate however I

411
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,980
do think there are good operators here

412
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,320
and I think the operators here actually

413
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,060
have become the smartest and the leanest

414
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,680
and they know how to compete in one of

415
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:01,109
the most competitive and longest-running

416
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:03,779
cannabis markets in the world and so

417
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:05,490
therefore I think that once California

418
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:07,139
gets sorted out there are going to be

419
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:09,710
incredibly attractive business

420
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:12,029
opportunities here and I think an MSO

421
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:13,680
should constantly be keeping an eye on

422
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:16,199
this market because who would not want

423
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,849
to have a toehold in the cradle of the

424
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,009
Emerald triangle or the cradle of the

425
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,089
breadbasket and the in the wine basket

426
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:23,309
and all of the wonderful things we have

427
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:25,920
here in California including the heart

428
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:27,029
of cannabis and so I think that I do

429
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:28,649
think that's coming

430
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:30,179
I think it's going to take a little bit

431
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:33,209
more time that mess those are definitely

432
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:34,979
focusing on EBIT positive businesses and

433
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,600
rightfully so because they've got enough

434
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,070
on their plate and these limited license

435
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,409
markets where many of them are focused

436
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:42,300
but I do think that when they can look

437
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:43,500
to these California businesses they're

438
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:45,809
going to see some of the most attractive

439
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,269
businesses in the entire world that I

440
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:50,250
would also say that some of the MSOs are

441
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:52,669
finding talent from some of these

442
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:55,080
California businesses because of the

443
00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:56,909
challenges they face and operating if

444
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:02,520
you can take that into basically and

445
00:15:56,909 --> 00:16:04,919
I'll go up oligopoly market limited

446
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,559
licenses limited license yeah yeah I try

447
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:09,240
to mix it up but they I mean then you

448
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:10,500
can really you can make it rain because

449
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,379
you knew what it was like to compete

450
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,720
against 750 illegal stores in this in

451
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:18,029
the Los Angeles market and still make

452
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,639
money doing it one of my favorite tweets

453
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:22,319
this year was somebody was like how did

454
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,090
we take something that inherently made

455
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,000
money and we managed all start losing

456
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:29,129
money doing it selling cannabis people

457
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,679
so I feel like there's something to that

458
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:33,509
but so I'm still very optimistic I mean

459
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:34,979
we when we formed our fund we did not

460
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:36,659
form it in Colorado which was the

461
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,460
popular concept at the time because

462
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:40,169
Colorado is where the legal don't market

463
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,700
was we formed it in California because

464
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:43,799
to me that California still is the

465
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,870
future of this it's the history and the

466
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:47,519
future of this industry so that is

467
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:49,320
optimistic what you're saying is keep

468
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,850
your nose to the grindstone the cycle

469
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,280
will turn and you'll be able to do your

470
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,720
deal in the future and if not just go

471
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,519
work for one of these guys and move out

472
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,129
- I don't know Virginia or wherever it

473
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:01,829
sounds okay focus focus yeah I'd have to

474
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:05,519
be an optimist to this industry for this

475
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:09,299
long okay so you might just say yeah go

476
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:11,279
ahead because I think it's unfortunately

477
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:14,309
we're having a very painful right sizing

478
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:17,069
of the market and necessary evil painful

479
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:20,279
nonetheless but anybody that's still in

480
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:22,799
this space is incredibly bright you

481
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:26,490
can't figure out how to be here and

482
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:28,139
still be here and not be incredibly

483
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:30,450
savvy and smart about your business

484
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,430
because it is incredibly difficult so I

485
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,200
think that's why those msl's are picking

486
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,360
off people and bringing them on board

487
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,230
and I will just say from a positive

488
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:44,699
outlook we're seeing and improve

489
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:46,259
in applicants for accounts meaning we

490
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,500
have a very thorough due diligence

491
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:51,028
process when we onboard somebody the

492
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,519
businesses are better structured the

493
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:55,109
paperwork's more in order the processes

494
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:58,259
going faster and faster so I think

495
00:17:55,109 --> 00:18:00,148
there's been and and and you see a month

496
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:02,369
on month the improvement so I think

497
00:18:00,148 --> 00:18:04,500
businesses are getting better at the

498
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:06,119
outset than they were you know you're

499
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,220
catching them and they probably started

500
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:09,839
several years ago but now we are seeing

501
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,819
an improvement which is a positive

502
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,849
change so things is that in California

503
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:16,470
or is that across the country you're

504
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:20,638
you're I like to think is each state of

505
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:24,480
each state as its own country right

506
00:18:20,638 --> 00:18:27,000
because unfortunately in my experience

507
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,038
we haven't seen States learn best

508
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,778
practices from other states necessarily

509
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,629
they kind of go do it on their own

510
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:34,679
unfortunately so if you go into Michigan

511
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,659
there's a there's a big learning curve

512
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:38,340
and some of that's natural right it's a

513
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:40,110
new market they're just opening their

514
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:41,730
businesses they don't necessarily these

515
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:43,558
from our perspective appreciate how

516
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,028
difficult banking is going to be oh it's

517
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:47,398
legal in Michigan I could get a bank

518
00:18:45,028 --> 00:18:49,740
account maybe maybe not so you kind of

519
00:18:47,398 --> 00:18:52,048
see a pretty steep learning curve but

520
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,750
definitively in California we're seeing

521
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:57,210
an improvement and then so to avoid

522
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,798
having to see Katie what are you

523
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:01,259
supposed what are you advising your

524
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,898
clients to do what are some of the smart

525
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:06,240
things to do on the front end

526
00:19:02,898 --> 00:19:08,099
well one comment on on the previous

527
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,599
topic the you know it used to be a

528
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:11,099
couple years ago if you just had assets

529
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:12,629
you get to attract capital and maybe

530
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:15,178
even have an early exit to get some

531
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,500
licenses you had some real estate those

532
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:19,440
days are over you have to actually have

533
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,210
a business fundamentals matter you have

534
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,960
to have a strong management team you

535
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,759
have to know how to run your business

536
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,220
efficiently how to use capital

537
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:29,460
efficiently so it you actually have to

538
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,808
it's like a startup company 101 right I

539
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,889
mean they actually you know have all the

540
00:19:30,808 --> 00:19:34,769
fundamentals that you need to actually

541
00:19:31,888 --> 00:19:37,678
run a business you know from things

542
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:39,690
things to avoid I mean there's things

543
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,429
that I've seen that are problematic is

544
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,950
everyone wants to get a deal done by

545
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:46,048
tomorrow and they don't spend time on

546
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,909
diligence they don't understand the

547
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:50,940
management team they don't do all the

548
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:52,620
kinds of the background stuff you know

549
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,779
from a diligent standpoint and I can go

550
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:55,859
a lot of details but a lot of companies

551
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:58,349
just don't have all their ducks in a row

552
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:59,549
I mean your ownership structure do you

553
00:19:58,349 --> 00:20:00,659
have documentation for everybody that

554
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:03,629
actually owns a piece of your business

555
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,610
we see it all the time where we go to do

556
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:07,380
a deal well it turns out that somebody

557
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:08,699
put a you know hundred K in two years

558
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,220
ago but they never got it they never had

559
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,170
a contract they don't know the terms

560
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:15,000
we've had issues come up where you know

561
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,230
they they say well I I want five percent

562
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,599
that was supposed to be two years ago

563
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,400
well now more money's come in so five

564
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:22,259
percent is now two percent but they

565
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,410
still want five percent and there's no

566
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:26,759
documentation we have issues where they

567
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:28,170
haven't done their securities filings we

568
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:29,940
have issues where they don't have

569
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:32,429
contracts with their employees we have

570
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,840
issues where they don't have documented

571
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:36,390
supplier contracts or distribution

572
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:37,980
contracts so across the board we have

573
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:40,559
issues where they haven't properly done

574
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,920
renewals so I guess long story short you

575
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:45,869
know get good counsel get good advisors

576
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,519
get everything paper and get every audio

577
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:49,589
ducks in row because not only will that

578
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,700
keep you out of trouble but that also is

579
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:52,678
going to help you sell your company for

580
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,500
a higher value do you have anything to

581
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:56,880
add to that Katie to avoid seeing you

582
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,730
yes all those things that you listed are

583
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,190
a really great way to end up hiring me

584
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:04,200
it's very sad so I see a lot of what I

585
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,730
call producers situations and back to

586
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,289
the story about the producers you know

587
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:09,690
those folks who you know were promised

588
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:11,639
5% and it wasn't papered a couple years

589
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,620
ago and now all of a sudden they heard

590
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,850
there's a big murder coming up and they

591
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:16,109
think they're gonna get paid out and

592
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:17,669
they come out with their hand out and

593
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:19,740
there's been a hundred and twenty

594
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:22,860
percent of the interest pledged to

595
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,870
people yes that is going to cause lots

596
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:27,599
of problems it's probably going to tank

597
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:30,719
your intended murderer acquisition and

598
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:33,808
you know disclosing what's going on with

599
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:37,440
your company is the best idea even if it

600
00:21:33,808 --> 00:21:40,379
takes your intended transaction because

601
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,090
if you don't say that oh by the way this

602
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,700
guy out here the news saying that I

603
00:21:42,089 --> 00:21:48,319
promised him 10% a few years ago don't

604
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:51,420
mind him put the risk on the acquirer

605
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:53,579
your co party to contract let them know

606
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,779
what's going on the good the bad the

607
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:56,639
ugly all of it

608
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:58,319
let them make the decision and let them

609
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,640
walk away it's better than getting sued

610
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:03,720
later don't you think

611
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,720
Emily you were involved with a special

612
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:09,419
purpose acquisition corporation in tech

613
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,220
that bought MJ freeway and went public

614
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:13,890
we've seen a few other of these facts

615
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,779
and I'm just wondering if you think this

616
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:20,669
is a positive for the industry and will

617
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:23,339
these be ways to consolidation and in

618
00:22:20,669 --> 00:22:24,840
retail but on the ancillary side which

619
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:27,538
is where they're gonna be limited the

620
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:30,869
ones in the US is this a positive in

621
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:32,970
your mind or negative so I it's

622
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:34,649
interesting how we went from this rush

623
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,640
to the RTOS and now I feel like it's

624
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,860
raining spax

625
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,630
having participated in really one of the

626
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:41,729
very first facts in the industry I

627
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:42,750
thought it was a very very good idea and

628
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:45,000
for the following reasons

629
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:47,579
it was allowing ancillary companies to

630
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,650
gain access to the capital markets in a

631
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:51,058
way that could create momentum behind an

632
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:53,429
ancillary company and push it to the

633
00:22:51,058 --> 00:22:55,408
next level at that point there was only

634
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:57,179
really the OTC markets available in the

635
00:22:55,409 --> 00:23:00,150
US so this was like a real opportunity

636
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:02,179
to get on the Nasdaq and that creates a

637
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:05,000
whole new access point in terms of

638
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:07,048
analysts coverage in terms of the and

639
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,339
institutional involvement all of these

640
00:23:07,048 --> 00:23:13,079
things that can make for a really

641
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:15,178
positive result i I know now it seems as

642
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:18,000
though you can't swing a stick without

643
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:20,100
hitting us back and in the US and it's

644
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,569
it's great in many ways because again it

645
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:23,339
could create some velocity around

646
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:25,589
capital flows within the United States

647
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:27,839
towards these ancillary businesses which

648
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:29,519
I've we've been a big fan of ancillary

649
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,899
investing since the beginning of our

650
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,779
fund in fact that's how we started

651
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,220
because we weren't sure how investors

652
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,990
would respond to plant touching

653
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:40,409
investing so we started with a lot of

654
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:43,019
tech and agriculture tech solutions to

655
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:46,620
try to improve the efficiency of grow so

656
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:48,418
I do see a place for it I have seen that

657
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:51,418
it can struggle to find the right

658
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:52,650
opportunity to invest and a lot of the

659
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:54,960
ancillary companies like in our

660
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:56,309
portfolio we're grooming them we're

661
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,819
waiting for them to be able to actually

662
00:23:56,308 --> 00:24:01,980
just IPO just do a real like direct IPO

663
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:03,289
either a direct listing or an IPO

664
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,460
process on

665
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:07,039
Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange

666
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,569
we're patient capital so we're willing

667
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,180
to wait a few years for that to happen

668
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:12,829
but if a company is looking to go like

669
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,480
I've seen a couple of tech plays like

670
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:17,960
I'm tech is a perfect example of this

671
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,120
which then became Kern or a Corona which

672
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,039
was the seed of that I would say was MJ

673
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:24,169
freeway and now they're looking to

674
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:26,450
acquire other tech companies to kind of

675
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:28,700
create this tech consolidated approach

676
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:31,069
suite of products for the industry I

677
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,660
could see how that works because when it

678
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:34,069
comes to M&amp;A if you're a public company

679
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,540
you have different currencies to play

680
00:24:34,069 --> 00:24:38,359
with and in other words you have stock

681
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:40,069
that you can really use to kind of drive

682
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:41,839
the transaction it doesn't have to just

683
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:44,149
be cash or it's not just private stock

684
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:46,009
transaction and so you have a little bit

685
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,390
more in terms of the heft of the

686
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:49,549
currency available and you can also

687
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:51,560
probably access capital more quickly if

688
00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:54,470
you need to do a raise to buy something

689
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:56,029
out so there's certain benefits to it I

690
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:58,519
wouldn't say it's the Holy Grail but I

691
00:24:56,029 --> 00:25:01,309
think it was a very in knowing the guys

692
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:02,960
that put together that first back I got

693
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:04,609
to understand where they were going with

694
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,160
it and I thought it was a very smart way

695
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:08,539
to approach a capital constrained

696
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:11,000
industry and to try to create more

697
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:13,039
access points one thing that makes me

698
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,960
crazy about this industry is that

699
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,789
because of the way the regulations are

700
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,970
like we can only accept accredited

701
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:21,440
investors into our funds or or even

702
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:23,870
higher than that and I think that

703
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,730
democratization of access to investing

704
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:27,769
into high-growth industries is important

705
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,450
and I think that having it listed on

706
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:30,829
these exchanges like the Nasdaq where

707
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,960
the reporting requirements are more

708
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:34,220
strict and I feel like it provides a

709
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,779
little bit more safety around those

710
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,700
investment opportunities for

711
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:39,430
non-accredited investors to be able to

712
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,960
participate in an industry like this

713
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:44,000
Eric I think you work mainly with with

714
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,000
plant touching companies but do you have

715
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,529
a view on the ancillary space an M&amp;A

716
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,029
that might be going on there now we're

717
00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:51,589
in the future yeah we'll work with

718
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:54,019
anybody whether it's a cultivator

719
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:56,659
distributor or manufacturer retail or

720
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:59,210
home delivery a jar manufacturer that

721
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:01,490
sells a portion of their jars to the

722
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:04,670
cannabis industry we're actually seeing

723
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:06,769
a lot of those ancillary businesses that

724
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:09,050
a portion of their business is cannabis

725
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:11,960
related because they received the check

726
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:13,210
from a cannabis company put it in their

727
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,740
be of a account and the guy

728
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:16,960
corporate accounts shut down so if

729
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,519
they're going to have a cannabis part of

730
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,829
their business they're opening up

731
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:23,069
separate accounts and I am so we're

732
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:26,139
seeing a lot of that and I think on the

733
00:26:23,069 --> 00:26:29,528
specifically on the M&amp;A side what we're

734
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:32,679
seeing is just and this is just

735
00:26:29,528 --> 00:26:35,528
anecdotally that people are moving away

736
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:37,570
from the quote unquote you know sexier

737
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:40,240
side of the business or the the consumer

738
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:42,788
facing side of the business and are

739
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,079
looking more at the infrastructure side

740
00:26:42,788 --> 00:26:46,950
of the business because that's really

741
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:49,058
what's missing you know distribution

742
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:51,038
financial whatever it may be it's the

743
00:26:49,058 --> 00:26:53,259
infrastructure to support the industry

744
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:56,408
that really needs to be there and then

745
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:59,048
you know as companies do do these call

746
00:26:56,409 --> 00:27:00,309
them roll ups or consolidations I do

747
00:26:59,048 --> 00:27:03,849
think people are getting a little more

748
00:27:00,308 --> 00:27:05,259
diligent in defining what is a fit for

749
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:06,759
their business it's very easy to get

750
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:07,658
style drift and get excited and buy

751
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:09,730
something because you think it's going

752
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:11,830
to work and then you realize wow that

753
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,778
that's not really our business it

754
00:27:11,829 --> 00:27:15,609
sounded it or look good and you can

755
00:27:13,778 --> 00:27:17,589
easily convince yourself that it's part

756
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:20,259
of your core business and I think people

757
00:27:17,589 --> 00:27:21,879
are taking a deep breath and stepping

758
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:25,329
back and saying okay does this really

759
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:27,370
make sense Brent separate from cannabis

760
00:27:25,329 --> 00:27:29,408
in the hip side it's that only a

761
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:30,639
down-cycle like we're seeing cannabis

762
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:33,190
when it comes to M&amp;A because of the

763
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,440
federal uncertainty or is there anything

764
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:38,048
specific to him right now that you all

765
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,048
are seeing on the hem side of it you

766
00:27:38,048 --> 00:27:43,058
were we see a huge opportunity on the

767
00:27:41,048 --> 00:27:45,759
hemp side and I assume everybody in here

768
00:27:43,058 --> 00:27:47,288
knows knows the difference on the

769
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:49,269
interesting thing about hemp it's now

770
00:27:47,288 --> 00:27:52,240
fully legal at the federal level and it

771
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:54,668
arguably has 50,000 industrial uses so

772
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,890
more than just hemp derive CBD or CBD

773
00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:59,080
related products but there are truly

774
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:00,940
many other you know plastic bottles and

775
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:03,970
batteries and car doors and houses and

776
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:06,220
and so we're we're definitely all in on

777
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:07,600
hemp and we're making sure our clients

778
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,950
understand that there's huge opportunity

779
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:10,538
there you know marijuana was always

780
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,159
going to be there but it's you know it's

781
00:28:10,538 --> 00:28:14,379
got its medical uses people use it to

782
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,210
have a good time but it's all it's all

783
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,890
just gonna be that you know hemp huge

784
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:19,720
and we're definitely seeing people want

785
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:21,520
to grow more hemp more states are

786
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,399
adopting their plans under the the new

787
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:26,319
USDA regulations and so our business

788
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:30,279
probably two or three years ago is

789
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:32,049
the 70 75 % marijuana and maybe 20 25 %

790
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:34,329
hemp now it's half and half and I

791
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:36,819
suspect in two years from now it'll

792
00:28:34,329 --> 00:28:39,009
probably be 70 75 percent hemp and 20

793
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:40,509
25% marijuana so asking a little bit

794
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:42,039
different everybody sitting on the

795
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:46,210
sidelines right now waiting for the FDA

796
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:48,069
to ultimately weigh in on CBD do you see

797
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:51,850
pent up demand from were consolidation

798
00:28:48,069 --> 00:28:53,859
when that happens so with regard of the

799
00:28:51,849 --> 00:28:55,779
FDA I mean it's that's not gonna get

800
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:57,789
resolved anytime soon right and so it's

801
00:28:55,779 --> 00:29:00,039
one of those things where folks are

802
00:28:57,789 --> 00:29:02,589
cautious but a lot of is just education

803
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:04,149
I mean educating our clients that yeah

804
00:29:02,589 --> 00:29:05,799
there is this FDA issue but I mean

805
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:08,650
there's compared to marijuana there's a

806
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:10,299
lot less risk in terms of hemp derived

807
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,920
products and that's really just related

808
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:13,089
to CBD

809
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,289
you know think outside the box and

810
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:16,720
there's so many of the things that helps

811
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:18,789
going to be used to get you know turned

812
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,069
into and also all the other parts of it

813
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:23,619
I mean all the genetics and all the

814
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:24,849
technology around you how do you grow it

815
00:29:23,619 --> 00:29:27,250
efficiently how do you process it

816
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:28,809
efficiently how do you efficiently make

817
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:34,569
it into batteries and bottles and cars

818
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:36,970
and plants and all that houses so people

819
00:29:34,569 --> 00:29:38,259
think of hemp as CBD hemp is so much

820
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:40,029
larger than that and so you know

821
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:41,799
definitely think outside the box and

822
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:44,379
also look at all the stuff that's going

823
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:45,730
to be needed to be developed in terms of

824
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:49,000
processing hemp and turning it into

825
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:50,950
products and scaling so I want to give

826
00:29:49,000 --> 00:30:00,759
the audience an opportunity are there

827
00:29:50,950 --> 00:30:02,110
any questions audience I have more

828
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:04,000
questions if you don't but I wanted to

829
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:07,059
make sure if anybody had questions for

830
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,039
the who's got a question anyone do I see

831
00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:13,710
you guys are all incredibly well

832
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:16,599
informed apparently knowledge you need

833
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:19,870
all right I'm gonna go oh wait I saw a

834
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:22,449
small hand wave oh right it was like an

835
00:30:19,869 --> 00:30:26,309
auction you have to be very on it it's

836
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:26,309
very subtle like an upper-class auction

837
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:39,670
so one of the things I did not hear I

838
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:41,589
still think that we're missing in the

839
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:44,740
industry as a whole when we talk about

840
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:47,949
risk and risk aversion and we talk about

841
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:50,200
insurance and you know yes they have

842
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:52,390
been providing business solutions and

843
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,819
such but they're finally really starting

844
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,050
to look at the industry as a whole so

845
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:58,359
those of us that have been doing this

846
00:30:56,049 --> 00:31:01,629
for a while I think that there's a big

847
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:03,879
opportunity to bring that group along

848
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:06,850
and not just in the investment so maybe

849
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:09,880
you can talk a little bit about avoiding

850
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:10,959
exposure and product liability and some

851
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:18,430
of the other things that are already

852
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:19,990
affecting us like a lawyer question do

853
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:22,240
you want to rephrase it so that he can

854
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:27,039
answer it I'm sorry yeah it was a little

855
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:28,660
hard to hear you sorry we talked about

856
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,399
the financial part of this but we're not

857
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:33,009
talking about the backend side of this

858
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,690
right so as we you know and this is

859
00:31:33,009 --> 00:31:36,490
probably - Katie a lot because you're

860
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:38,799
probably dealing with some of those

861
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:40,529
things and I think we see the whole vape

862
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:44,859
gate and what we learned from

863
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:46,809
unregulated unlicensed areas great so

864
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:48,429
one way I would answer that would be to

865
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:51,009
make sure that you are surrounding

866
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:53,440
yourself with the experts who know what

867
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:55,660
they're talking about and that means

868
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,100
almost endless specialization right if

869
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:59,560
you're concerned about your product

870
00:31:57,099 --> 00:32:00,669
liability which you should be everyone

871
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:03,069
should it be everyone in the supply

872
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:05,860
chain make sure that you are going to

873
00:32:03,069 --> 00:32:08,139
someone and go retain a lawyer who is a

874
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:10,029
product liability specialist do not go

875
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:11,860
to the criminal defense attorney that

876
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:14,798
kept you out of jail in the 90

877
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:17,139
right hey that guy is great we're very

878
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:19,539
happy with him but it's like asking a

879
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,340
podiatrist to do heart surgery right so

880
00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:23,139
the way that you I think the way that I

881
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:24,849
see that people have the best luck

882
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:27,059
controlling their risk is when they're

883
00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:30,189
seeking out and spending the money on

884
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:31,839
the real professionals who know what's

885
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:33,640
going on and really we were joking about

886
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:36,308
this in the in the green room earlier

887
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:38,980
but like it's so much cheaper to hire

888
00:32:36,308 --> 00:32:41,069
someone who's a specialist at the front

889
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:43,960
end than it is to hire a litigator

890
00:32:41,069 --> 00:32:45,399
afterwards right this is really like do

891
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,169
not be penny wise and pound foolish

892
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,179
really look into your wrist be very

893
00:32:47,169 --> 00:32:51,100
honest with yourself about where it is

894
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:53,259
and listen to your advisors about who

895
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:55,418
else you might need to go look towards

896
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:56,950
and so that that's one of the biggest

897
00:32:55,419 --> 00:32:58,900
mistakes that I see people doing is that

898
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:00,789
they rely on one lawyer for everything

899
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,380
or one consultant for everything and

900
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:09,490
that's that doesn't work in any other

901
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:11,200
industry why would that work here my

902
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:13,660
name is Helene Servian I'm a partner at

903
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,110
journey one we do early-stage cannabis

904
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:19,150
investments my question was around

905
00:33:16,109 --> 00:33:21,339
there's two parts of the question what

906
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:23,700
industries outside of cannabis are you

907
00:33:21,339 --> 00:33:26,589
guys most intrigued or excited about

908
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:29,319
that you think will start to tip into

909
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:44,949
near future M&amp;A and the second part is

910
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:47,500
if those industries alcohol or direct up

911
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:49,200
your alley we though is it the first

912
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:51,429
part of the question is that what other

913
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:56,860
industries am i interested in investing

914
00:33:51,429 --> 00:34:01,660
in that I think near future M&amp;A so the

915
00:33:56,859 --> 00:34:03,609
example like food and beverage yeah I

916
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:05,558
mean they're all over the space I would

917
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:07,389
say food and beverage or traditional

918
00:34:05,558 --> 00:34:09,759
consumer packaged goods companies are

919
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:12,039
all over this industry already they're

920
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,190
already talking to companies already

921
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:17,710
looking at them but what I'm a little

922
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:19,869
I'm not even sure that it's going to be

923
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:21,668
M&amp;A and not build your own product in

924
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:23,590
many of those cases because we have yet

925
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:24,108
to see breakaway brands we have some

926
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:28,039
brand

927
00:34:24,108 --> 00:34:29,748
are bigger in this industry but from my

928
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:31,460
background of use I used to consult for

929
00:34:29,748 --> 00:34:32,959
PepsiCo and so I understand the way

930
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,579
these groups think about it and there's

931
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,349
a lot a lot of market research and

932
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:38,089
understanding that goes into new product

933
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:40,609
development and and launching these

934
00:34:38,088 --> 00:34:41,898
products so if there's a low moat around

935
00:34:40,608 --> 00:34:43,998
it they're just going to do it

936
00:34:41,898 --> 00:34:45,710
themselves and so right now I feel like

937
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:48,199
CBD would be falling right into that

938
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:49,659
category and so I'm I'm probably one of

939
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:52,128
the more skeptical people that

940
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:54,220
acquisitions of high multiples of CBD

941
00:34:52,128 --> 00:34:56,358
brands are going to happen from

942
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:58,759
traditional CPG companies or even

943
00:34:56,358 --> 00:35:00,858
alcohol brands I think that from what I

944
00:34:58,759 --> 00:35:02,568
understand constellation kind of regrets

945
00:35:00,858 --> 00:35:05,088
the way that they invested into canopy

946
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:06,619
growth corporation and I think that they

947
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,998
I mean they've been pretty vocal about

948
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:09,470
their disappointment and in the

949
00:35:07,998 --> 00:35:11,719
performance and the lagging of the

950
00:35:09,469 --> 00:35:14,419
launching of beverages and so I think

951
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:15,588
that we've got some pain points to go

952
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,650
and I don't think we're gonna see those

953
00:35:15,588 --> 00:35:21,108
lofty multiples for a while again I

954
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:23,269
think that when some of the regulations

955
00:35:21,108 --> 00:35:25,098
change around banking and when when

956
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:27,409
things open up a bit more and things get

957
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:30,769
up sighs we could see some more interest

958
00:35:27,409 --> 00:35:32,538
around that but I do think that it's so

959
00:35:30,768 --> 00:35:34,399
I know beauty brands like I know L'Oreal

960
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:36,230
is looking at the space I know that

961
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,910
alcohol is looking at the space I know

962
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,679
consumer packaged goods companies are

963
00:35:37,909 --> 00:35:41,268
looking at the space I know big Big

964
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,618
Tobacco is looking at the space all of

965
00:35:41,268 --> 00:35:44,058
them are investigating it and all of

966
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:45,170
them are trying to decide if they just

967
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:47,869
do it themselves or if they buy

968
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:50,450
companies and they're gonna be slow

969
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:52,519
until the FDA weighs into on CBD

970
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:56,149
probably yeah it depends on where

971
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:58,419
they're located too but testing did

972
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:00,920
anybody else have anything to add I

973
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,358
think it's kind of interesting because

974
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,309
some some people are a lot of people

975
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:05,568
think that cannabis is like is this

976
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:07,069
really really different thing and has to

977
00:36:05,568 --> 00:36:09,288
be treated differently I mean it's

978
00:36:07,068 --> 00:36:11,808
there's some legality and regulatory

979
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:14,059
hurdles but it's it's a plan right and

980
00:36:11,809 --> 00:36:16,430
and it's gonna evolve like most other

981
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:18,289
industries and so don't think of it that

982
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:19,909
differently right in terms of from an

983
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:20,749
investment standpoint and how it's going

984
00:36:19,909 --> 00:36:22,009
to evolve what and where the

985
00:36:20,748 --> 00:36:23,808
opportunities are because it's you know

986
00:36:22,009 --> 00:36:25,039
we're gonna look back in 15 years so

987
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:27,170
yeah that's just like everything else

988
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:28,278
that evolved at some point in time you

989
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,389
know what I think is interesting though

990
00:36:28,278 --> 00:36:31,969
you pointed out about the other

991
00:36:29,389 --> 00:36:33,710
industrial uses of hemp and that is

992
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:34,899
where I'm seeing some large

993
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:37,869
multinational

994
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,889
and he's like fashion brands are talking

995
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:40,990
to those companies because they have

996
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:43,088
something proprietary and special about

997
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:44,919
how they can create an actual textile

998
00:36:43,088 --> 00:36:47,078
that's user friendly actually

999
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,639
eco-friendly and something that these

1000
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,930
large companies can work with and then

1001
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,578
they can talk about this really

1002
00:36:49,929 --> 00:36:53,288
interesting story about bringing hemp

1003
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:55,420
back bringing seeds they're calling it

1004
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:56,470
seed disown movement so there's some but

1005
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,329
that's where I'm talking about with the

1006
00:36:56,469 --> 00:37:00,459
moat that gets really interesting and

1007
00:36:58,329 --> 00:37:02,318
that's when the M&amp;A gets that's when you

1008
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,519
get the better bio it's great point

1009
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:05,019
because really the only thing that's

1010
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:07,028
concerns people right now about CBD is

1011
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:08,619
the FDA issues there's so many other

1012
00:37:07,028 --> 00:37:10,210
uses of hemp that there's there's

1013
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:11,980
literally no restrictions now to develop

1014
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:17,579
products using using that plant for all

1015
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:17,579
these other products any other questions

1016
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:23,710
