company in north america

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,920
all right great so

39
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,839
what are the differences between u.s and

40
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,240
global strategies for investment and

41
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,040
operations let's start from moser

42
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,039
um moser can you tell us a little bit

43
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,680
you know your point of view on

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,560
differences and similarities

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,159
between us or north american you know

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:00,000
canada as well and european companies in

47
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,159
their operations strategies

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,759
i think first of all

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,079
if you look at us

50
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,118
there are front runners in the sector

51
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:11,680
and the companies are much larger than

52
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,840
than in europe and i think

53
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,560
in u.s a lot of companies acting

54
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,200
globally in europe most companies are

55
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,680
just acting in their countries

56
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,959
because it's a bit i would say a very

57
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,360
fragmented sector in europe right

58
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,439
and just to elaborate on that why do you

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,080
think north american companies are

60
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:34,000
acting internationally versus you know

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,160
differently from european companies

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,759
acting more domestically

63
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,439
i think first of all they have much more

64
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,679
money because

65
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,159
the money markets in north america

66
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,360
especially in u.s also canada are much

67
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:50,878
larger so they have a lot of

68
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,959
cash funds to invest approach and of

69
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,199
course they invested

70
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,039
you know too much money so they lost a

71
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,158
lot of money if you look at the stock

72
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:03,199
market if you look at you know the

73
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:05,598
the listed cannabis companies the stock

74
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,119
went down market cap went down because i

75
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:10,560
think they invested

76
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,158
i would say not smart the money they got

77
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,920
beautiful actually i'm going to jump to

78
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,120
jamie here

79
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,199
because i know

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,200
you know her background so

81
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,158
based on what moser

82
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,759
just said right marcus

83
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:26,719
so sorry

84
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,399
um so he's saying that the reason why

85
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:29,598
north american companies are going

86
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,760
internationally is because they have

87
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:34,158
more money do you agree with that in

88
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,079
terms of you know is there like a growth

89
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,679
problem here i don't think so i don't

90
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,719
agree with that i think

91
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,560
um what and i don't think you're wrong i

92
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,199
think it's um i think there's more to

93
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,759
the story and i think the

94
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,839
the piece that i would add to that

95
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,479
couple things number one

96
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,479
let's take the publicly listed company

97
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,399
true leave for example

98
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,238
um their market caps down i think

99
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,319
they're trading around 12 when they

100
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,400
normally operate around twenty eight

101
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,919
dollars there they were around a ten

102
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,760
billion dollar market cap i think now

103
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,199
they're like two and a half billion

104
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,598
um

105
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:12,158
that's they've put up 18 profitable

106
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:14,479
quarters they've continued to exceed

107
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:15,919
analyst expectations

108
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,399
that's not because they're making bad

109
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:20,399
decisions that their market caps low as

110
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,198
i said in my keynote the entire sector

111
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,359
is down so i don't think that you can

112
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,000
say that american companies are making

113
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,680
bad decisions i think it's cannabis

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,959
you're swimming upstream

115
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,639
you are operating in prohibition and

116
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,560
capital is not easy to get doesn't

117
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,079
matter what continent you're on um

118
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,120
because there is a stigma there's a lot

119
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,199
of fear

120
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,840
um but what i will say is you can run a

121
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,600
fantastic company right now and your

122
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,758
market cap's going to be

123
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,199
in the tank that's just the reality of

124
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,280
the world that we live in right now i

125
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,680
think to answer your question why are

126
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,279
u.s companies looking to come to europe

127
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,840
it's a burgeoning market

128
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,638
we're we're starting to see

129
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,000
the

130
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,079
you know

131
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,279
playing out of what we witnessed and

132
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:08,240
what we experienced in the us in 2016

133
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,399
2017 as different states started to

134
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,000
legalize and you're starting to see the

135
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,918
spread of cannabis

136
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,639
across the european continents very

137
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:19,680
exciting and for those of us that have

138
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,600
experienced that first to market success

139
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,280
we've got another market that we can go

140
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,520
jump in and be first to market i think

141
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,119
that's why these american companies are

142
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,120
looking for other opportunities where

143
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,280
they can jump in and take a stranglehold

144
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,519
on a market and be first to market

145
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,679
that's what i think is happening exactly

146
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,240
other opportunities so

147
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,038
what are the current u.s msos expansion

148
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,360
consolidation strategies and reasoning

149
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:46,319
you know behind that

150
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,280
well i've had several msos approach me

151
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,240
to

152
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,319
you know

153
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,400
put my fingertips out into the world and

154
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,759
see where there's opportunity and what

155
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,239
they're what they're doing is trying to

156
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,879
smell who are the operators that are

157
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,560
tied into money who are tied into

158
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:04,079
legislation and who are tied really kind

159
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,639
of are operating in the background and

160
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,719
they know what's happening and so the

161
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,319
msos who've been there done that are

162
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,759
smart and they're looking for the

163
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,120
operators so

164
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,038
with that being said

165
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,000
if you're an operator out there and

166
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,680
you're running uh an operation that is

167
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,360
well-funded that's connected

168
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,840
legislatively

169
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,319
and that has the ability to to do big

170
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,879
business across multiple countries you

171
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,720
should come find me

172
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,600
let's ask a question to david actually

173
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,639
uh

174
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,520
as a you know continuing from this topic

175
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,240
uh

176
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,959
can you tell us a few strategies for

177
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,800
cannabis investment operators that uh

178
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:46,159
that we've seen uh

179
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,160
work internationally um well better or

180
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,560
worse you know from the united states

181
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,840
into into other countries

182
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,360
thanks claudia

183
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,198
actually let me step back a little

184
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,680
because first of all

185
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,840
i'm an investment bank uh banking firm

186
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,519
golden eagle partners uh we're the first

187
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,159
investment bank to be in cannabis in the

188
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,439
u.s we jumped into 2013

189
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,120
but i think i want to tell a little

190
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:08,639
story because it helps inform our

191
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,959
perspectives because i've been very

192
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,960
lucky uh to do what we're doing because

193
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,560
i started out in biotech have two

194
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,638
undergrad degrees biochem molecular

195
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,800
biology and got into biotech companies

196
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,199
actually one based here in berlin book

197
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,280
15 years operational experience luckily

198
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,199
got inventorship on two u.s patents for

199
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,119
my work in bioprocessing with

200
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,199
recombinant hemoglobin

201
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,720
so that's as you guys know

202
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,120
processing is a huge part of this

203
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,280
industry whether you're talking hemp

204
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,759
marijuana cbd thc whatever you want to

205
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:40,399
call it got an investment banking 2005

206
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,160
doing biotech deals i also did five

207
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,758
years of business development working

208
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,120
with companies doing deals with pfizer

209
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,360
astrazeneca

210
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,560
and then moved back to colorado in 2009

211
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,080
to lead the life science group at a

212
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,000
group called headwaters

213
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:54,000
and then left in 2012 to found gold

214
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,560
legal partners and that's when

215
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,399
colorado and washington voters legalized

216
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,439
it so in 2013 we started working in the

217
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,839
industry

218
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,680
we've done 25 deals in the space we

219
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,758
helped pharmacan raise one of the

220
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,598
leading msos raised 30 million we helped

221
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,479
a panacea which is a leading hemp

222
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:13,519
processor to a strategic deal

223
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,478
in 2019 uh but we've also spoken around

224
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,198
the world

225
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:20,000
uh on cannabis we're the only investment

226
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,199
bank in davos in 2020. uh we've spoken

227
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,680
in dubai

228
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,879
toronto twice cayman frankfurt earlier

229
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,720
this year

230
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,400
and obviously now berlin

231
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,560
and one last thing too if you guys know

232
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,718
athletes for care it's a great group

233
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,599
i played pro lacrosse so i've been an

234
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,760
athlete

235
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,839
ambassador for athletes for care for

236
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,240
five years and then also i'm the chief

237
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,800
scientific advisor for the industry or

238
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,158
for athletes for care so i put together

239
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,679
a group of the leading scientists

240
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,159
including ethan rousseau guillermo

241
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:50,559
moreno-sans from spain raquel perube

242
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,639
from uruguay and also deb kimlis from

243
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,958
the u.s so when you're talking about

244
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,958
science cannabis and finance we

245
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,479
certainly are a global leader but as far

246
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,439
as getting back to

247
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,240
hey nick

248
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,800
as far as the the strategies for even

249
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,480
investment and operation the title here

250
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,639
one thing i want to say quickly is

251
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,000
failure coming from the science side is

252
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,759
a great teacher

253
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,278
especially if you learn from failure is

254
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:17,278
not so bad right uh so essentially

255
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:20,080
we've seen a number of things failures

256
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:22,399
and i mentioned this in davos uh

257
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,320
certainly one a couple of the problems

258
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,159
people assume markets are going to open

259
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,320
up much quicker than they do

260
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,838
uh we see that as a problem you may know

261
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,839
canopy growth

262
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,920
put 40 million into a facility in south

263
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,200
africa and selling it for pennies on the

264
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,879
dollar

265
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,959
the other thing that we know a lot about

266
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,039
is the biological supply chains are

267
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,759
inherently unstable and so a lot of

268
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,439
these growers you name it i mean uh

269
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,759
aurora had the big facility out of

270
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,519
edmonton that they shut down and i'll

271
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,000
tell you if you want to talk to me later

272
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,240
i actually know the reason why uh but

273
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,720
they assumed all these producers assumed

274
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,519
okay we grow they'll come which is

275
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,200
another uh fallacy and then the other

276
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,320
thing that we've found and i think jamie

277
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,480
will agree

278
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,480
uh there's actually been very little uh

279
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,240
history of first mover advantage in this

280
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,079
industry serna where i worked at i was

281
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,600
chief business officer and i failed to

282
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:13,199
mention one of the first public

283
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,320
companies in the space it went public in

284
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,959
march 2014 they were the biggest name in

285
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,360
cannabis in 2014 they had the biggest

286
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,879
booth at the ntia events they're nowhere

287
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,360
to be found now if you've got dixie

288
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:27,600
they're gone uh canopy growth who knows

289
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,000
what's gonna happen with that right so

290
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,240
uh those i think failure when you can

291
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,399
talk to me later is a great teacher on

292
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,039
whether what you do with operations or

293
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,320
what you do on investment

294
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,240
can you elaborate a little bit more on

295
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,440
the first mover advantage

296
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,919
actually first of all i want to

297
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,920
introduce

298
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:51,440
yes sorry uh i'd like to introduce

299
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,679
nicolas fais senior research analyst at

300
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,640
brian guernier so another research

301
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:59,120
channel is consulting advisory guy here

302
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,958
hi how are you finally he was talking

303
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,919
another uh he went to the other hotel

304
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,000
unfortunately

305
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,559
yeah and on top of that and you couldn't

306
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,399
enter the hotel here because there was

307
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,000
uh an important person who was trying to

308
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,839
get out of the hotel so the police

309
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,278
blocked everybody getting in there's a

310
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:18,000
delegation here at this hotel

311
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:20,240
welcome so sorry to be late thank you

312
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,919
so so now just david uh quickly really

313
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,200
quickly like the first movie advantage

314
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,000
because we're seeing like you know

315
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,000
mexico coming online like brazil very

316
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,759
soon of course all these countries in

317
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,559
europe and now thailand as well right so

318
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,078
you know

319
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,639
what why do you think first mover

320
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,000
advantage is not a good thing uh well

321
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,159
actually

322
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,519
people like jamie will love this the

323
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,679
problem is there's been too much

324
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,959
arrogance and too little humility in

325
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,958
this industry

326
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,159
people think that their first mover

327
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,799
they've got them they've got four

328
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:53,360
billion dollars i mean that's gone from

329
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,439
canopy growth so that's i think the very

330
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,600
short and sweet of it is if you're going

331
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,120
to be successful in this industry

332
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,159
take a little humility and don't be so

333
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,000
arrogant

334
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,360
to that point i think what happens a lot

335
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,720
is

336
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,639
people that have had success in

337
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,240
mainstream business

338
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,519
have a level of arrogance and they come

339
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,879
in and they're like oh well there's a

340
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,399
bunch of stoners we're going to come in

341
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,278
and we're going to show them how to do

342
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,320
stuff

343
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:16,159
and then

344
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,240
they don't realize it's not not that

345
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,078
simple cannabis is a very difficult

346
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,720
business and it's its own

347
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:24,319
um industry it's its own community

348
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,639
and

349
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,600
there's a lot to know about operating

350
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,000
both

351
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,759
in and out of the legal sphere or in the

352
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,519
gray area and a lot of you know

353
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:36,078
traditional business people aren't

354
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,839
comfortable operating in the gray area

355
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:39,759
and you better get used to it if you're

356
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,320
going to be in cannabis

357
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,159
right so cannabis actually is comprised

358
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,399
of so many verticals right so we're

359
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,278
looking at agriculture of course biotech

360
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,559
manufacturing now technology

361
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,519
distribution

362
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,319
and consumer products and pharma right

363
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,799
so

364
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,800
so bank is a consumer product company a

365
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,000
little bit like you know also canopy

366
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,759
took

367
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,679
that approach right um can you give us a

368
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,720
comparison between

369
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:10,879
the normal consumer product cpg industry

370
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,639
versus you know the one in the cannabis

371
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:15,679
and the problems

372
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:19,360
the most obvious one in the u.s is

373
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:22,559
um if i were let's say producing i don't

374
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,680
know why tampons come to mind

375
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,439
if i were producing that i'm going to

376
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,958
produce it in one spot

377
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,079
and then i'm going to put it on a truck

378
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,199
and i'm going to ship it to all 50

379
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:33,519
states but in cannabis i have to have 50

380
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,920
different manufacturing facilities

381
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,759
because it's federally illegal

382
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:40,000
which means that i can't do interstate

383
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:42,240
commerce i can't cross state lines well

384
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,120
that means as a manufacturer of

385
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,959
chocolate i have to have 50 different

386
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,240
chocolate machines

387
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:53,198
and when they're let's say 150 to 250

388
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,759
000 a piece it becomes cost prohibitive

389
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:58,479
to automate the manufacturing of the

390
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,399
product times 50. so then i'm making

391
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,440
decisions about how many redundant

392
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,519
machines do i want to have

393
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,519
there are some places where i can't make

394
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,480
the decision to get rid of it i have to

395
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,480
have a tempering machine in every single

396
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,600
facility where i'm at but i don't

397
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,399
necessarily have to have the big fancy

398
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,079
flow wrapper i can do that manually or

399
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,679
with a foot pedal because i don't want

400
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:26,239
to have 49 redundant flow wrappers

401
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:28,879
i'm always parallel processing federal

402
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,198
legalization um and then the other thing

403
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,559
is basically in cannabis we struggle

404
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:35,039
with banking

405
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:38,638
and we struggle with marketing uh right

406
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,919
now every single person i would argue on

407
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,919
the globe

408
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:44,240
is buying their products

409
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,479
on their phone right in that device they

410
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,198
have in their pocket cannabis companies

411
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,800
are not allowed to market on social

412
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:55,359
media on facebook and so we kind of have

413
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,599
to swim upstream in the marketing world

414
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,919
and do what i call guerrilla marketing

415
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,759
so you have to do targeted marketing you

416
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,159
want to use influencers and you kind of

417
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:07,759
have to figure out ways around it so if

418
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:09,759
you're an agile business operator and i

419
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,360
would argue that's the other reason why

420
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,958
we need to pull

421
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,399
people from

422
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,958
the roots in the suits we need to pull

423
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,720
the roots into the into the industry is

424
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:21,919
that these are people that already have

425
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,800
experience operating in an upstream

426
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,799
environment and having to go around

427
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,078
being out in the open uh so those are

428
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,078
the people that are going to give us

429
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:32,559
advice about how do you get your how do

430
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:35,278
you get the word out how did jungle boys

431
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:37,919
for example when they opened in florida

432
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:39,198
jungle boys outsold every mso

433
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,120
on day one

434
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,359
with no social media tell me how they

435
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,120
did that we need to go talk to them

436
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,480
because they can tell us how they did

437
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,720
that

438
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,560
but if we have the arrogance to think oh

439
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,759
well i come from cpg and i know what to

440
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:53,359
do

441
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,879
i can't tell you how many times i've had

442
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,879
an executive come from mainstream go oh

443
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,159
all you got to do is i'm like well if

444
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:01,519
you want to spend your money doing that

445
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,799
but i'm going to tell you right now it's

446
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,519
not going to work

447
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:07,278
and it's going to be a waste of money

448
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,078
and that's what invariably happens and

449
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:12,559
that's why canopy is losing

450
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,919
you know 100 million dollars or 300

451
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:16,078
million dollars a year is because

452
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,159
they're just throwing money at problems

453
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,479
and you've got to be strategic

454
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,559
so you don't think consolation gave a

455
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,320
good direction to the company

456
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,159
i think constellation came in and

457
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,000
thought they were going to treat

458
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,078
cannabis like alcohol and it just

459
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,039
doesn't work like that

460
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:36,719
so you touched on marketing marketing is

461
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:39,278
a big problem in the united states

462
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,278
what about it's global

463
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,360
facebook isn't going to let you market

464
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,679
cannabis in europe either

465
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,879
it's a global problem right right

466
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,479
perfect

467
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,480
so let's ask a question to

468
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,838
you have a deep knowledge in the market

469
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,159
your research analyst

470
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,680
so um

471
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,318
what advantages

472
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:08,159
does the european market have over the

473
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:09,599
u.s market for investment operations

474
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,919
have we seen

475
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,918
european companies attracting blue chip

476
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,559
companies like you know north american

477
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,559
companies have

478
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:22,480
so can you repeat the question okay um

479
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,199
so let's talk about the you know the

480
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,679
advantages and advantages of european

481
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,640
european and u.s companies right

482
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,000
um

483
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,240
with your expertise in different markets

484
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,359
can you tell us the advantages or

485
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,440
disadvantages of um you know european

486
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:42,159
the european market over the u.s market

487
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,120
for investments and operations

488
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,519
have you seen a european

489
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,918
cannabis camp based companies attract

490
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,519
blue chip you know investment strategic

491
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,160
investments

492
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,359
as much as north american companies well

493
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,519
but

494
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:00,719
even the even the north american market

495
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:03,440
initially there were

496
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,200
large cpg companies who were starting

497
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,160
looking and putting their toes in the

498
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,080
water

499
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,240
we had some tobacco companies we had

500
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,000
some beverage companies including

501
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,120
constellation brands

502
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,960
but i think

503
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,079
that they have been drawing

504
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,960
have been

505
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,279
um

506
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,600
coming back from that idea

507
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,879
take imperial imperial brands for

508
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:27,439
example who took a stake in oxley and

509
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,960
in the uk uh oxford cannabinoid

510
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,720
technologies

511
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:35,360
initially they were very much looking at

512
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,160
cannabis as something that could be a

513
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,959
new

514
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,279
product and and relieve some of their

515
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,759
growth problems but

516
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,359
only to uh to realize that they were

517
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,759
actually uh

518
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:50,159
defocusing from their core business so

519
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,240
they say well okay let's let's stop that

520
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,120
uh i think also constellation brands

521
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,359
have been

522
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:57,038
looking at like that same with a b

523
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,678
that joint ventured with

524
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:02,720
with tillway but i said well no we think

525
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:06,798
that the risk is too high for us to uh

526
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:09,600
to to to be involved at this stage in in

527
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:11,279
the cannabis area so i think that most

528
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,439
um

529
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:15,359
large cpg companies who initially were

530
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,679
looking at that sector they have come

531
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,839
back from that idea so it is uh

532
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,080
unfortunately it will be just uh

533
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:24,798
on our own and we don't need to look at

534
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:27,199
those bigger

535
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:29,038
companies to to support

536
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,480
the cannabis industry

537
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:34,720
okay um so would you agree

538
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,400
that you know the biggest the biggest

539
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,480
multinational cannabis companies can be

540
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,080
divided kind of in two

541
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,079
in two sections

542
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,918
consumer product

543
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,480
and

544
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:47,759
pharmaceuticals

545
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,919
so what kind of trends have you seen in

546
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,319
europe versus you know north america i

547
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,840
think also for the pharmaceutical level

548
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,319
it's exactly the same

549
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:59,279
i take for example a belgian company ucb

550
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:02,158
is very strong in the epilepsy

551
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,759
didn't dare to touch at all

552
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,919
anything that has to do with with

553
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:08,960
cannabis just because there were are

554
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,880
afraid that it could back could come

555
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,400
back with them and hurt them because

556
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,840
they all had of course

557
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,720
the the decent opinoid crisis uh in in

558
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,038
mind

559
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,440
and uh they are a bit afraid and say

560
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:24,879
well if only that something similar will

561
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,240
happen to uh to cannabis let's stay away

562
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,679
see how things

563
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,798
develop so i think also for the

564
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,798
medicinal

565
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,798
cannabis market it's a little bit like

566
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,879
that and what happens with the canadian

567
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:38,158
companies who initially were medicinal

568
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,400
cannabis companies then came adult use

569
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,000
and then they didn't not know what to do

570
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,679
so they just do everything oh we're

571
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,480
doing a bit of medicinal maybe doing a

572
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,360
little bit of adult use and

573
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,720
oh

574
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,479
let's go in

575
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,440
europe let's go in europe as well and

576
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,038
have um

577
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,038
and do a bit of that as well and they

578
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,960
just spent money without

579
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:58,240
having uh their

580
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,640
basis

581
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,798
operations in order and that was the

582
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,320
problem with the canadian some of the us

583
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:07,599
msos are slightly better uh in in doing

584
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:09,519
so

585
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,879
i call that the something shiny syndrome

586
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,639
and part of it is

587
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,080
oh there's something shiny over here and

588
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,720
over here and over here because there's

589
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:19,359
so much opportunity

590
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,279
that there is a bottomless pit

591
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,119
of where you could spend money to try to

592
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:24,960
make money but i think you're right you

593
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:26,639
have to stick to your core focus and get

594
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,960
really good at what you're

595
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,480
doing i will say

596
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,558
it makes me

597
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,720
angry that

598
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:37,038
the stigma is stopping these big

599
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,839
companies from diving in and i think if

600
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:42,558
there was one company that had a ceo

601
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:44,959
with big enough balls to do it

602
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:47,359
they're gonna go make a lot of money

603
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,319
but everybody's afraid and i think this

604
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:52,639
fear it's time for it to be over because

605
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:55,200
we know that cannabis is helping people

606
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,159
with epilepsy and parkinson's and we're

607
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,720
only going to know what we're able to do

608
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:03,440
with research we need medical research

609
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,440
we need the governments to knock it off

610
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,000
and i mean if i could ring all of their

611
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,840
necks personally i probably would

612
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,279
or a ceo with big enough ovaries

613
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:15,199
well ask me to do something and i'll

614
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,759
probably do it

615
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,200
i just

616
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,839
why not

617
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,319
exactly so what this is completely out

618
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,240
of you know but um what have we had here

619
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:28,158
but nah so would you recommend the

620
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,759
government or fda to be way more

621
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,120
involved and

622
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:33,759
you know

623
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:36,479
basically regulate better but also

624
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:38,079
substantiate what's going on the hard

625
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,599
part is

626
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,279
anything that you say is going to be

627
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,839
controversial because if we ask the

628
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:46,558
government to deschedulize to deschedule

629
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:48,399
cannabis from schedule 1

630
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,558
then it's going to open a whole nother

631
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,640
can of worms but what we really need is

632
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:55,038
access to medical research

633
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,400
so that i look at it like

634
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:58,879
we just don't even know how many

635
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,640
cannabinoids exist right now

636
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,120
we don't know what the combination of

637
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,159
this one that one and this terpene could

638
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:08,399
do for this or that ailment what we have

639
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,720
is a ton of anecdotal evidence

640
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,559
and we know that nobody's ever overdosed

641
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,640
on cannabis so we know that it's a

642
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,240
plant-based medicine we know that it's

643
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,520
generally non-addictive we know that

644
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,120
it's safe

645
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,119
all of those things i'm making these

646
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:23,599
statements and i don't even know if i'm

647
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,678
speaking the truth because i'm

648
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,599
going off anecdotal evidence what it

649
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,720
would really be great is if we could

650
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:33,519
figure out that when you have epilepsy

651
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,759
of this sort that you take this

652
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:37,440
combination like i my daughter has

653
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,359
epilepsy she's probably gonna kill me if

654
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,159
she hears me

655
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,359
we have her on cannabinoid therapy they

656
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,640
give her

657
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:46,959
thc

658
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,840
full spectrum cbd which includes a small

659
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,600
amount of thc

660
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:54,240
thca linoleul

661
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:56,319
limonene and turmeric well is there a

662
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,759
pill that she can take that has all of

663
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,000
those no

664
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:02,079
i happen to be a cannabis executive so i

665
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,440
can go get linalool i can go get

666
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:08,240
limonene i can get thca i can get full

667
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,960
spectrum cbd so i have my daughter off

668
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,240
of anti-seizure medications which were

669
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,519
making her

670
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,839
sleep for 18 hours a day at 21 years old

671
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:20,000
we should be that should be available to

672
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:22,240
everyone who has epilepsy not just the

673
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,359
daughter of a cannabis executive

674
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,400
because we

675
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:28,479
she's not had a seizure in two years on

676
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,320
that medication

677
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,000
that's groundbreaking

678
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:34,558
because we know that these anti-seizure

679
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,720
medications have so many side effects

680
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,480
that's one ailment

681
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,480
but think about parkinson's and think

682
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,480
about all the other things

683
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,159
think about anxiety just think about the

684
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,038
people that want to use cannabis instead

685
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,440
of alcohol which is a poison

686
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:51,759
opiates which is a poison and super

687
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,480
addictive our governments are going to

688
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:56,640
have to step up and give the people what

689
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,038
they want it's time

690
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,480
globally

691
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:06,079
so do you think that more clinical

692
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,679
studies uh would benefit not only the

693
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:09,038
pharma

694
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,960
you know vertical of the industry but

695
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:12,798
also the consumer product vertical in

696
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,360
the industry absolutely i mean the more

697
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:16,879
we know the better we do right

698
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:20,158
correct exactly

699
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,880
um nick give us a little bit of a um

700
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,278
a

701
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,600
you know information on the european and

702
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:28,400
german market

703
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:30,558
so i heard that the german market could

704
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,600
be potentially as big as the california

705
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:33,839
market

706
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:37,119
can you give us some you know

707
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:37,119
can you shed some light on this

708
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,798
and if you look at all the markets

709
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:45,038
across across the globe

710
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:45,038
and

711
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:49,038
when we look at

712
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:52,000
how large has those markets

713
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:55,038
and the complicated calculation on how

714
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,599
often does somebody consume cannabis and

715
00:25:55,038 --> 00:26:00,960
at what rate do they consume but on

716
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:02,319
average it's a it's around 160 grams

717
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,679
per annum

718
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:07,678
for the the cannabis consumers so that

719
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,720
and that is true in canada that's true

720
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:14,080
in california that is true in florida

721
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,159
so it's around 160 grams on average so i

722
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:18,639
would expect that that's exactly the

723
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,000
same in in europe

724
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,320
so if we then look at what the

725
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,319
prevalence rate is in in germany for

726
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,798
example that's that's just over seven

727
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:30,558
percent so 80

728
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:34,000
million uh at seven percent that's a 5.4

729
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:35,359
uh i believe uh 160 grams well that is

730
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,079
close to a

731
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:42,399
thousand tons or 950

732
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:43,839
tons and that is at at the current stage

733
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,240
and

734
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:49,839
in all the markets whenever they

735
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,919
is a trend to legalize uh cannabis we've

736
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,839
seen an uptick in those prevalence rate

737
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,759
because there are consumers who would

738
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:58,079
love to try it would love to be on on

739
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:00,720
cannabis but don't dare to go to the to

740
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:03,678
the black market also and that it's a

741
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,839
quite a significant topic it's about 50

742
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,720
uptick that we're seeing for example

743
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:10,158
canada

744
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,480
2015 or so

745
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,480
the balance rate was 15 percent

746
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,759
now it's 21

747
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:20,000
same same was true in in california

748
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,240
although we had that all heritage in in

749
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,319
california so so

750
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,480
same will happen in in europe and in

751
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,960
germany so for example if you go back to

752
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,038
my seven percent well let's say it ticks

753
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:36,319
up to ten percent or ten that's eight

754
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:37,359
million times 160 that is uh 1 300 tons

755
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:40,398
uh

756
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:43,199
way more than the 400 tons that somebody

757
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:45,759
came up a couple of years ago um so i

758
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,640
think that was a very strong under

759
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:50,158
underestimation um

760
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,600
and i think you need to couple with that

761
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,840
the fact that

762
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,439
germany is the size of

763
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:58,720
oregon

764
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,240
geographically and has public transport

765
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,200
and when you think about the whole us

766
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,000
market or you just think about

767
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,919
california geographically

768
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,159
getting product to all of the people of

769
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,320
california is a challenge it'll be much

770
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,240
easier to do it in germany i think the

771
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,639
distribution in germany is much more

772
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,120
sophisticated so if you do have that 10

773
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,440
percent and you have that small

774
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:22,079
geographic location i think you're

775
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,159
you're going to see the penetration um

776
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:26,158
increase at a much higher rate

777
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,559
well that's a good point uh what about

778
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,840
other countries in europe at the moment

779
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:33,440
can you give us some information

780
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:34,720
everybody's looking at what germany is

781
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,640
going to do how they're going to get

782
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:41,600
around legalizing um adult use cannabis

783
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,360
and then others will very quickly follow

784
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:45,359
portugal

785
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:47,839
italy probably as well

786
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:52,558
luxembourg malta who

787
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:52,558
has tried before switzerland is already

788
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,240
legalizing adult use whatever way you

789
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,559
you look at it so but give us a little

790
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,359
bit of some numbers like you know the

791
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:05,038
projected market size in europe or in

792
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:07,678
germany well

793
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:10,319
well the same reason that we did earlier

794
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,519
for germany we can use for uh for for

795
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:13,519
europe

796
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,440
because okay in some countries like

797
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:18,158
france or italy or

798
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,159
spain the pre-valence rates are higher

799
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:23,600
already today than than that seven

800
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:25,360
percent in in germany um but then if we

801
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:27,038
look at it all in all

802
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:28,398
well we come at a market which is

803
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:31,200
probably

804
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:33,759
six thousand seven thousand tons and

805
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:37,519
then uh pick your price at which

806
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:39,759
current black market price is ten euros

807
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:44,240
probably will go down because the 10

808
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:44,240
euros black market that is a that is a a

809
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:50,719
not competitive price it's a it's a it's

810
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:53,759
a monopoly monopoly run by the

811
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,960
cartel so we'll come down say to i don't

812
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:58,720
know seven euros just to say something

813
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,519
seven thousand dollars times seven

814
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,839
that's

815
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:03,839
449 that's 50 billion

816
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:05,678
markets in europe

817
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,038
mortgage markets

818
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,278
i mean

819
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:11,679
seriously as i mentioned before they've

820
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:14,159
always been over hyped i mean that the

821
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,679
problem with this industry is it's going

822
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,120
to be a race to the bottom it's going to

823
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,919
be a commodity and it's going to be

824
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:21,599
about your supply chain okay

825
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,360
you're talking about europe

826
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:25,119
where is it going to be produced and how

827
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:27,038
is it going to be produced is it going

828
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,479
to be colombia is it going to be lesotho

829
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:31,200
is it going to be canary islands is it

830
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,679
going to be greece guernsey jersey

831
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,278
cyprus we've talked to groups all in

832
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,720
those countries macedonia maybe portugal

833
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:40,480
i don't know the freaking answer and

834
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,919
nobody in this room does the other

835
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,079
question is how is it going to be

836
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,640
produced is it going to be produced

837
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:48,639
just as a phytosource is it going to be

838
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,799
for example there's companies now in the

839
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,919
us that are producing hemp growing it

840
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:56,079
outside producing cbd and cbd and doing

841
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,360
a simple chemical conversion to delta 9

842
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:59,519
thc

843
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:01,278
then do you have yeast you have a coli

844
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,440
do you have chemistry or do you have a

845
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:05,119
combination thereof where you grow as i

846
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,320
mentioned some kind of certain

847
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:09,759
cannabinoid or or purify it out and i

848
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:12,158
don't have the answer either although

849
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:13,839
i'm i'm pretty smart scientifically so i

850
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,640
think you know the markets have always

851
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:18,959
been over hyped and you name it the

852
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,320
question is what is the supply chain in

853
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,079
five years going to look like and where

854
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:25,038
is it going to be produced you know i

855
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:26,398
agree and and um whatever market that we

856
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:28,240
look at is

857
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:30,079
always an oversupply

858
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,200
and and that will be a feature of this

859
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:36,158
industry for for the decades to come so

860
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,038
in the growing there will be oversupply

861
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,519
uh

862
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:40,720
way way more than demand can uh can can

863
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,798
stomach so

864
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,720
on growing at that yeah wherever it

865
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:46,398
comes from initially germany probably

866
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,000
will be the the

867
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:50,158
the

868
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,480
the garbage bin of the world probably

869
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,600
everybody who has some excess capacity

870
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,440
uh will start if they are allowed to

871
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:59,199
export into germany

872
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,960
part of it's because of the energy

873
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,519
consumption

874
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,880
and so i what i'm hoping is that germany

875
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,839
will

876
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,760
allow

877
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:09,439
growers to grow

878
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,879
in germany i don't predict that that

879
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,080
will happen because of the energy

880
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,159
consumption

881
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:15,918
and so it is i think you're right the

882
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,919
garbage i wouldn't call it the garbage

883
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,960
but whatever i think the cannabis will

884
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,200
come in but

885
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,600
i think that david makes a great point

886
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,000
because you can grow outside you can use

887
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:28,000
the sun i think it's weird that we

888
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,119
thought that people were going to grow

889
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,278
cannabis indoors in canada

890
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:35,278
and mimic the sun

891
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:38,159
how expensive is that for you to have a

892
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:40,319
giant warehouse have a bunch of lights

893
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,240
and then grow it inside when i think

894
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:45,119
about from a chocolate standpoint nobody

895
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,359
grows sugarcane in a warehouse

896
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:49,439
and mimics the sun so that they can make

897
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:50,719
a product you know ultimately it is a

898
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,960
commodity

899
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,278
but i do think and the market market

900
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,798
thing i agree with but i also think you

901
00:32:55,278 --> 00:33:00,640
have to have market predictors to know

902
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:02,319
what the demand is going to be so that

903
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,120
you can kind of wrap your brain around

904
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:06,798
it what i've seen is this

905
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:08,558
cycle of

906
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:10,639
governments always

907
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:13,519
come in with fear and they don't issue

908
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,919
enough licenses and then the people sell

909
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,079
out it's crazy though i predict this

910
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,799
will happen in germany they're gonna the

911
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:22,960
day one of sales doesn't matter what it

912
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:25,278
is everyone's gonna sell out and they're

913
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,200
to go oh crap we need more and then

914
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:28,960
they're going to open up the floodgates

915
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,000
and then too much cannabis is going to

916
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,679
come in and you're going to have an

917
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,640
oversupply this happens every single

918
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,679
time and then the market speaks and then

919
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,919
it's the good operators who are

920
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,000
running good companies that will make it

921
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,360
and everybody else gets flushed out so

922
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,599
these companies that you talked about

923
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:46,959
the very beginning in 2014 that don't

924
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:49,038
exist

925
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,880
you know it's it this is the cycle

926
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:52,000
there's a reason they don't exist right

927
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,919
so

928
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,480
in the end it will be and that's where

929
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:59,120
uh cannabis is very similar to um to

930
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,679
other cpg companies it are the proper

931
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:03,599
operators who have a strategy who know

932
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,480
their consumers who

933
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:08,239
produce at low cost or and trying to

934
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,280
differentiate their product and and

935
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,439
brands

936
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,599
i thought they going to be the winners

937
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,838
uh and and in that sense it's very

938
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,200
similar to other cpg companies at the

939
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:19,039
end of the day

940
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:21,918
the commodity that we are all going to

941
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:23,599
end up fighting for is shelf space yeah

942
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,199
let's talk about that by the way yes

943
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,280
it's important the consumer product

944
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,118
space so what is the difference between

945
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,359
a shelf space

946
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,519
seen as a commodity in regular consumer

947
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:35,119
product companies versus cannabis well

948
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:36,559
think about when you go into a grocery

949
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,039
store you have these end caps you have

950
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:41,918
merchant you have entire companies whose

951
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:44,320
job it is is to merchandise products so

952
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,319
they come in and they teach the cpg

953
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,800
companies how to put products at eye

954
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,399
level how to bribe the store so that

955
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,399
they're not down here on the shelf that

956
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:54,878
they're not up here on the shelf you all

957
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:55,918
want eye level you want to have

958
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:58,159
their

959
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,239
colors in your branding so we all know

960
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:02,078
all the fast food companies america

961
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,679
they're all red and yellow wendy's

962
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,920
mcdonald's they're all red and yellow

963
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:09,358
why because that is the psychological

964
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,358
color of hunger etc etc it becomes very

965
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:12,799
sophisticated very scientifically

966
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:14,960
oriented

967
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,880
it's big business

968
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,960
that is all big business

969
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,480
cannabis right now is

970
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,119
everybody who's got a little bit of a

971
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,920
creative you know bone

972
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,440
they create some cool brand and

973
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,680
that's all going to wash out and we're

974
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,880
going to see it become systemized and

975
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:36,559
scientifically designed

976
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:39,200
i'm wondering if um marcus has

977
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:42,159
any insight into that coming from

978
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:42,159
from your area

979
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,880
but what i would add that in europe the

980
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:49,838
companies have

981
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,079
less money and i think the problem you

982
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:53,039
mentioned and you know coming back to

983
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,200
the

984
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:57,358
i think truly is a good company is a

985
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:59,439
good example but there are also negative

986
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:01,199
examples in the industry and i think

987
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,838
europe has the advantage that there is

988
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:06,078
not enough money available

989
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:07,838
for the sector at the moment so the

990
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,400
company really have to spend the money

991
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:12,559
smart and then i think

992
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,119
that's an advantage but also

993
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:16,719
disadvantage because um

994
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,280
it goes lower

995
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:21,838
as expected and i think the problem is

996
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,480
really the legal frame because i would

997
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:27,519
compare europe with u.s because you have

998
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,760
28 countries with different laws and in

999
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:32,800
us it's similar you have different

1000
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,800
states some states is allowed some not

1001
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,839
and i think that's the problem that we

1002
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,280
need a

1003
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:40,159
european

1004
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,640
wide legal frame that companies can

1005
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:45,519
operate

1006
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:47,759
so we have we have only a few minutes uh

1007
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:49,440
is there anybody here who would like to

1008
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,079
ask a question

1009
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,240
to the panel just raise your hands yeah

1010
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,280
for claudia and the whole panel first of

1011
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:57,279
all it's fantastic

1012
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,359
hello good morning my name is philippe

1013
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,679
rogerdark i'm from mercury in the uk we

1014
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:07,199
make inhaled cannabinoid therapy we come

1015
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:08,799
from the pharma sector

1016
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:10,879
i have a question about investment the

1017
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,280
big elephant in the room particularly

1018
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,440
when it comes to clinical evidence

1019
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,079
so you jamie particularly said we need

1020
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,358
clinical evidence that's very expensive

1021
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,720
and at the moment i don't think the

1022
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:24,000
margin on the products particularly

1023
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:25,919
flowers justify the the investment so

1024
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,440
can someone comment on that elephant in

1025
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,400
the room how are we going to raise the

1026
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,159
money

1027
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,440
who is going to pay for it and how the

1028
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:33,440
product is going to pay for it

1029
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,440
let's let the investment advisor answer

1030
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:39,439
that

1031
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,200
well come from biotech i think there's a

1032
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,679
company called radical science if you

1033
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:45,279
know out of la started by jeff chen

1034
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:47,598
who's essentially doing this with

1035
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,599
cannabinoids where you can do like

1036
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,720
what's called a stage four trial

1037
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,000
essentially it's kind of out in the

1038
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:54,319
market where you're doing really good

1039
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,838
data analytics so that's one of the

1040
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,039
things you guys i look them up they're

1041
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:58,719
doing some really interesting things so

1042
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,079
that's a cheaper way to go

1043
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:02,159
we actually are working right now with

1044
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,359
epm which is one of the leading israeli

1045
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:05,118
companies

1046
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:07,119
generating cannabinoid acids and they're

1047
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,480
going to do a clinical trial process

1048
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,640
they need to raise a lot of money but

1049
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,119
you bring up a good point you need to be

1050
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:14,960
creative and find a way to finance

1051
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,320
really good science it's not a clinical

1052
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,119
trial because

1053
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,519
most people we know and we we've been

1054
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:24,720
raising money for science-based cannabis

1055
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:26,400
companies since 2015. it's not easy

1056
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,959
because you're straddling the biotech

1057
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,720
cannabis sector and the biotech

1058
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,639
investors don't want to do cannabis they

1059
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:33,919
don't like to do weed and then you look

1060
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:36,319
at the cannabis sectors and they're like

1061
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,720
that science makes my head spin so it's

1062
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,400
a very good question and frankly uh i

1063
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:42,319
don't have an answer especially in 10

1064
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,760
seconds well i think necessity is the

1065
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,720
mother of invention

1066
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,400
so the fact that we need it somebody's

1067
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:50,399
going to figure it out their people are

1068
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,039
figuring it out like jeff chen but i

1069
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,800
think the other thing is

1070
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:57,838
what i find in cannabis is that there's

1071
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,000
a lot of personal stories that you have

1072
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:01,599
incredibly high net worth individuals or

1073
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,599
family offices

1074
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,359
where they have a personal story or a

1075
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,800
personal connection to the plant and

1076
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:08,480
then you have some

1077
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,880
people that are

1078
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,240
single-handedly funding things because

1079
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,240
they're passionate about what's

1080
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:15,239
happening

1081
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:18,879
anybody else

1082
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,920
would like to ask a question we have one

1083
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,119
minute less than one minute

1084
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,440
all right i think you've taught them

1085
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,880
everything they need to know

1086
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,639
all right perfect

1087
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,000
let's hear it again

1088
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:35,239
for claudia marcus and jamie

1089
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,239
and everyone
