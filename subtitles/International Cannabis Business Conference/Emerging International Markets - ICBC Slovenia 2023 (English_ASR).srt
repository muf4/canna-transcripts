1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,439
to discuss emerging International

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,940
markets we have a crack team and the

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,339
panel will be moderated by the president

4

and CEO of hello cannabis let's welcome

5
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:11,419
Stephen Furby

6
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:21,778
hey everybody

7
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:25,820
um as angawa stated I my bad we were

8
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:25,820
actually close friends I'm sorry buddy

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,179
my name is Stephen verbique I'm from

10
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:33,420
Canada I founded a company called hello

11
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:35,340
cannabis back about eight years ago we

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,920
started in tissue culture and genetics

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,320
merged with a different LP and

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,140
concurrently I was working as a medical

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,058
clinic we branched off into recreational

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,320
we opened up the very first recreational

17
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:51,780
store in the G20 nation and uh just for

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,280
my own credibility I'll say that there's

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,259
very few people in the world I can say

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,000
that they have sold over 50 million

21
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:00,718
dollars worth of legal cannabis and and

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,780
I'm one of them that is a claim to not

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,118
fame but a claim to a reality that we

24
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,500
are actually people that do it and this

25
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:10,260
is why I believe that this is one of the

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,760
most important panels here because we

27
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,400
are seeing everybody talking about

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,680
Concepts and ideas on how to bring out

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,240
legalization we have been a part of this

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,040
I'm one of the co-authors and

31
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,379
contributors for the Cannabis act in

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,600
Canada and the very first continuing

33
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:26,879
medical education course where there

34
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:28,618
were six co-authors for it myself being

35
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,079
one of them so doctors can literally

36
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:33,060
earn credits in Canada for medical

37
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:36,719
cannabis and I'm one of the contributing

38
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,159
authors authors for this so myself and

39
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,780
every single person on this panel I know

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,400
them all very personally as well for

41
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,978
many years we are people that are

42
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,960
actually doing it and we have seen this

43
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:48,500
from concept where we're going back over

44
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:50,759
a decade I'm part of the Legacy market

45
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,799
so we have seen this from Black Market

46
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,379
Legacy Market all the way to a gray

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,000
Market to a legal market and battled

48
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:58,618
everything including the governments

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,959
including the doctors and all of the

50
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:03,239
problems and gaps that I have been

51
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,618
hearing all across the world I've now

52
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:07,919
spoken in I believe 16 different

53
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:09,479
countries they are all identical and I'm

54
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,500
telling you that every single person in

55
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,780
this panel

56
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,139
is somebody that has lived through this

57
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:19,500
and is still doing it right now to this

58
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:21,059
day and our resources that can help we

59
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,098
are here to be able to help countries

60
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,259
that are legalizing we have been through

61
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:27,479
this already and we are sources of

62
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:29,579
people we are resources that are

63
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,519
actually doing it and this is something

64
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,560
that unfortunately is not happening in

65
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,420
many areas it is still just talk it is

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,459
still just conversations and you even

67
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:40,619
saw the largest market which is Germany

68
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,378
is still talk

69
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,480
they're still figuring it out right and

70
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:47,878
I've been speaking in Berlin for seven

71
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,500
years now where it was still raw raw raw

72
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:51,299
legal legal legal league seven years

73
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,979
later we're still figuring it out

74
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,420
so we were people that have figured it

75
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:56,399
out in countries that have figured it

76
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:59,579
out and we've battled and we are still

77
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,420
battling a wild industry um to this day

78
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,459
so that is my story and I urge you to

79
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:07,259
listen to these people they each have a

80
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,759
different specialty and they're close

81
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:10,799
friends and colleagues that I

82
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,959
collaborate with around the world and we

83
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,640
are truly here to help people we get

84
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,140
more joy out of being able to contribute

85
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,958
and collaborate with different countries

86
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:21,299
and of course self-fulfilling prophecy

87
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,860
here as well we also have careers and we

88
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,080
like getting paid but we bring value

89
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,060
that is the point here we're not just

90
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,159
taking shareholders money we we are

91
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,539
Revenue generating companies and our

92
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:32,818
goal is to be able to help you generate

93
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:34,739
revenue and not just be fluff and talk

94
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:36,419
and burning money every single day which

95
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:39,239
is what the vast majority of this entire

96
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:41,818
industry is so this panel is different I

97
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,340
assure you without further Ado this is

98
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:45,419

113
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,380

117
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,439
the pilot project in Switzerland where

118
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:36,719

123
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,860
active we are Revenue generating we are

124
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:52,259
real companies real people operating

125
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,900
real things and I I think I've said the

126
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:59,360
word real enough but I want to reinforce

127
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:59,359
that it's real last time I'll say that

128
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:06,418
so the focus of this panel is

129
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:09,660
well tell you what

130
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:11,279
I spoke uh very broadly about each of

131
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,199
you would you like to elaborate further

132
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,758
about what you do individually and then

133
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,639
we will have a round table discussion

134
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,979
and I do believe that in open Forum here

135
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,500
because we are resources

136
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:26,219

137
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:28,259

140
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:36,240
in Malta I am a licensed physician and

141
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,580
prescriber and I support doctors with

142
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,160
two things educating doctors to become

143
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:42,899
prescribers and better with private

144
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,380
supporting them with Tech Medical Tech

145
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:48,659
data Tech which is supporting doctors in

146
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:51,439
all areas of medicine but especially

147
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:55,139
cannabis medicine and Innovative Fields

148
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:57,899
Malta has had medical cannabis now for

149
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:00,418
five years and since then it's been a

150
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:03,599
lot of battles a lot of work some things

151
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:05,519
have worked some things haven't and the

152
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,879
best part about being here and speaking

153
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:12,060
to you is to see the enthusiasm and to

154
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:14,459
help of enthusiasm and make it to the

155
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,019
other side with success and hopefully

156
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:18,599
avoiding some of the pitfalls and some

157
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:20,099
of the bullets that we've had to take in

158
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,960
our own respective countries and lessons

159
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,539
we've learned we have lots of bullets in

160
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:27,120
us it's it's not an easy industry I can

161
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:28,860
promise that so when you find anybody

162
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,139
that has been in this industry for

163
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,840
longer than five years it's a lifetime

164
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:36,478
right we say dog years like it's so cute

165
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,219
when people say like oh I've been in the

166
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:39,839
Cannabis industry for a long time it's

167
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,819
like how how long and they're like like

168
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,679
two three years and they're like

169
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,000
crazy like how long have you were like

170
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,220
12.

171
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,220
and yeah I had hair before by the way

172
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:55,318
uh Kiara everyone my

173
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,860
and I think I get the prize for coming

174
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,960
from the furthest away uh so I'm here

175
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,720
from New Zealand

176
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,818
Helios is a medicines company we are New

177
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,520
Zealand's largest producer of medicinal

178
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:10,259
cannabis as Stephen said we're the only

179
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:12,779
New Zealand grown New Zealand made

180
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:15,060
producer who is in Market

181
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:18,359
we were the first to achieve our GMP

182
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:20,280
license back in 2021 uh we've been in

183
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,560
market for two years in New Zealand

184
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,899
catering for patients in New Zealand

185
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,300
first that was one of our real goals at

186
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:30,659
Helios was to look after our own

187
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:33,418
patients first as you heard we're

188
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:36,660
ramping up for export now we're a

189
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:39,120
vertically integrated company so we have

190
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,439
our own highly controlled indoor

191
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,439
cultivation

192
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:45,180
we have our own extraction facility we

193
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,819
make our own finished products we have

194
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,879
our own GMP analytical testing labs and

195
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:53,039
our own r d space we also have a number

196
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,219
of collaborations across New Zealand

197
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,500
with research and development

198
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,000
Partnerships into universities and I

199
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,199
think one of the things that I can

200
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,500
probably share is a different

201
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,319
perspective here on how medical can be

202
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,300
done and done really well it's not all

203
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,340
perfect that one I will definitely say

204
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,319
but one thing that we do see in New

205
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:15,000
Zealand which is a bit different to what

206
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,740
I'm seeing in Europe is really strong

207
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,918
government support

208
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:22,620
so we have support and funding for our r

209
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,538
d programs we have support and funding

210
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,759
for our export plans part of the reason

211
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:28,740
that I'm here today to be able to tell

212
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,439
you all about what we're doing in New

213
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:34,200
Zealand and we also as a small country

214
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,778
not quite as small as Slovenia but just

215
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,240
five million people we're able to really

216
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:41,639
interact and talk with our Ministry of

217
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,379
Health with our politicians and with our

218
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:46,259
government departments and I think that

219
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:47,820
Slovenia could really learn and and do

220
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,559
that as well with being able to have

221
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,360
those conversations just like the ones

222
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,199
we're having here today

223
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,200
fantastic

224
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,519
yeah thank you my name is I'm a lawyer

225
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:04,799
from Germany I'm a lawyer since 2003 and

226
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:08,278
as Germany legalized medical cannabis in

227
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:11,219
2017 also the first CBD products came up

228
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:13,259
and no one really now knew how to

229
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,120
regulate them or how to treat them and

230
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:17,819
then I started to Deep dive into these

231
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,440
regulations I started to block and this

232
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,180
block was read by prohibition Partners

233
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,860
prohibition Partners was read by mjbiz

234
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:25,819
daily and was invited to the U.S to

235
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:28,019

education

252
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,860
give it up for Kai

253
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,019
if you want legal representation and any

254
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:18,360
connectors in the Cannabis industry I

255
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:19,980
urge you to find a good lawyer I would

256
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,959
not be sitting here today if I didn't

257
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,959
have representation from a good lawyer

258
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:26,879
in fact actually Eric Foster was a

259
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,559
partner at Dentons in Canada and was one

260
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,720
of the people that actually helped train

261
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,939
Peter who is now head of the the

262
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,399
European

263
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:38,700
cannabis area here and if it was not for

264
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:40,740
me meeting Eric Foster of Dentons and

265
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,300
somehow someway impressing him which is

266
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,180
baffling still because he's kind of a

267
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:46,979
big deal just like Kai

268
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:48,838
they make introductions and they pick

269
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,700
their battles and there's a lot of

270
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,160
cannabis clients that are out there all

271
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:56,459
hunting but a good lawyer is somebody

272
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:59,100
that I urge you to Cozy up with and he's

273
00:10:56,458 --> 00:11:02,659
handsome too

274
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,659
that's my sales pitch for you pal

275
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:08,039
Nema it's all you buddy hi everyone

276

00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:14,399

278
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:16,019
in Slovenia really nice country it looks

279
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,440
like Switzerland over here so I feel

280
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:18,440
like home

281
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,200
um I've been a friend of the plant for

282
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,420
20 years

283
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,839
I've been in this business for seven

284
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:31,099
years I have a law background but not as

285
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,100
many as he does

286
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:36,899
um started the first company with CBD

287
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,958
with my brother Swiss him care so we're

288
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:42,120
family owned business we started with 40

289
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:44,578
000 Swiss Francs

290
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,039
um Build It Up made millions of Revenue

291
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:50,399
made a lot of money then went to

292
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:52,679
Medicinal cannabis which is Charlie's

293
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,620
lab my other company a laboratory then

294
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:59,039
we lost a lot of money

295
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:03,720
um and then we applied for the Swiss

296
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:06,778
pilot trials which started this year and

297
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,180
we officially are allowed to sell THC

298
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:12,078
from first of January 24th so I'm really

299
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:12,078
excited about that

300
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:20,278
[Music]

301
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:22,319
so as I said the resumes on this table

302
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:24,958
are pretty significant

303
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,480
and I'd like to reiterate as well um

304
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,979
Slovenia is like a second home to me my

305
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,680
first 11 University was actually

306
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:35,459
Slovenian and I lived here for a couple

307
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:38,338
months and I'm For Hire I would love to

308
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:42,179
be a part of this country officially

309
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:45,060
um that's my sales pitch for myself

310
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:47,939
I'm not kidding so uh let me know if I

311
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:50,338
can help in cannabis and Slovenia and I

312
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,980
I will come running very quickly I love

313
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:56,720
it here like what the like

314
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,720
we're in a Disney movie right now guys

315
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:02,100
so um let's let's talk about some themes

316
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:04,019
that I've noticed that were consistent

317
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,940
here today and I assure you they're

318
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:09,000
consistent across the entire world

319
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,500
and one of them is uh on just focusing

320
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,720
on the medical side

321
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,659
we we find that there is a big roadblock

322
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,700
with access to medical cannabis and the

323
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:20,458
first step is of course physician

324
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,079
awareness Physicians are a unique breed

325
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,819
and what I've noticed is that Physicians

326
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:26,278
are a unique breed across the entire

327
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,379
world with very similar similarities

328
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:31,458
good one

329
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:35,100
um I'll work on my vocabulary too sorry

330
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:39,059
uh with without physician education it's

331
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:41,579
lost and like Sylvania has had medical

332
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:43,799
cannabis legal for what six years

333
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:45,539
how many prescriptions are active here

334
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:46,919
like that's crazy

335
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:49,379
right

336
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:51,120
I I want to jump out the window hearing

337
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:53,159
that like that's crazy

338
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,419
and the reason that there's no

339
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:56,219
prescriptions is because there's no

340
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:56,939
Physicians prescribing right but they

341
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,920
could

342
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,079
why are they not

343
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:02,879
makes no sense the reason is because

344
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:04,799
it's lack of Education

345
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:07,559
right they're not Googling how it worked

346
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,899
in Canada in Reading when they have

347
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:11,518
spent their how many years getting a

348
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:13,440
license that could be in Jeopardy by

349
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,139
prescribing a narcotic

350
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,660
so the first step is destigmatizing it

351
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:21,000
right I'm on cannabis right now

352
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:22,799
like I'm stoned

353
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,019
and I promise I could write a Calculus

354
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,359
exam I'm not intoxicated

355
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:28,799
and my job is to destigmatize cannabis

356
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,778
around the world I've got an interesting

357
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:32,639
personal story but I'm a moderator and I

358
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:35,039
won't take the sunshine here

359
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,680
but the Physicians need to be educated

360
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,240
and they're a unique breed in order to

361
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:42,599
educate them you have to be face to face

362
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:45,419
or be another physician they're I find

363
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,920
it is very difficult to be able to break

364
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:49,679
through to Physicians

365
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,479
so I'm saying all these things to lead

366
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:54,359
into a doctor that's sitting beside me

367
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,339
that specializes in Tech and specializes

368
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,079
in educating doctors and allowing them

369
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:00,899
to be able to prescribe more effectively

370
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:02,219
allowing them to be able to titrate to

371
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,980
be able to find out what cannabinoid

372
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,019
profiles work what levels of THC what

373
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,000
levels of different different elements

374
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:11,459
of the plant what levels of either

375
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,039
combustion or non-combustion what

376
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:16,198
delivery mechanisms he has developed

377
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:18,000
Tech that is very similar to the tech

378
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:20,219
that we developed in Canada but he is

379
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,559
taking it to another level to make the

380
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,959
prescribing process easier

381
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:27,419
and I believe that this is the Forefront

382
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,518
to be able to help Slovenia here because

383
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:31,979
if there are no prescriptions

384
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,500
you've been legal for six years

385
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,539
so this gentleman is somebody that can

386
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,980
provide the tools to be able to help

387
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:40,980
educate Physicians so that they can

388
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,300
prescribe better more effectively more

389
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,820
confidently

390
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:46,919
and it's coming from a physician

391
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,660
so reach out to this guy

392
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:51,799
thank you Stephen thank you for the

393
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:54,899
introduction yeah in Malta

394
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:57,659
the experience of having six years now

395
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:59,940
of medical cannabis and the same metric

396
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:02,278
is is a problem the the number of

397
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,139
Physicians and that metric affects the

398
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:06,000
accessibility because if there are not

399
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:08,659
many Physicians it's difficult to get

400
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,159
access and when you think about

401
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:15,600
accessibility and physician education

402
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:17,458
you get down to to a barrier and the

403
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,620
the problem is the barrier and the

404
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:21,838
solution is a bridge to that barrier and

405
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:24,919
first you need to look at the difference

406
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:28,019
between legalization and normalization

407
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:29,578
so in 2010-18 when motor legalized

408
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:32,100
medical cannabis there was a legal

409
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:34,138
channel for doctors to to write a

410
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,839
prescription and uh just like any other

411
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:40,259
prescriptions they have

412
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:42,139
um a legal access but any prescription

413
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:44,639
made by a doctor

414
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:47,698
anywhere carries

415
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,698
await that weight is the warrant this is

416
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:52,679
why we allow doctors to prescribe

417
00:16:49,698 --> 00:16:55,679
substances for people to use

418
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:57,719
um in in our mainstream societies and

419
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,299
when I educate doctors and I teach

420
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,040
prescribers about how to go about adding

421
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:03,838
cannabis to

422
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:05,338
to their Arsenal to the therapeutic

423
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,919
Arsenal ultimately there are two things

424
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:09,240
which arise it's about the scientific

425
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,000
and

426
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,140
the educational part let's say and the

427
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,380
liability

428
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:19,259
liability of a doctor

429
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:21,120
writing a medication which can go really

430
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:24,660
either way just like any other therapy

431
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:27,239
it's uh it's a risk benefit analysis

432
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,040
and that risk benefit is something that

433
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,200
every doctor has in his mind before he

434
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,119
makes decision the decision I will

435
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,519
prescribe this medicine

436
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,279
so that's what's really been lacking in

437
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,679
many countries around the world

438
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,298
legalization is only a half measure the

439
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:44,298
next measure is to get that into

440
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:46,798
mainstream medical

441
00:17:44,298 --> 00:17:48,538
prescribing mainstream mainstream

442
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:50,819
medical doctors

443
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:52,558
um and we have a lot of scientists

444
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,298
earlier on today we had we had some

445
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,740
brilliant panelists and some brilliant

446
00:17:54,298 --> 00:17:57,538
speakers talking about the science of

447
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,599
the endocannabinoid system

448
00:17:57,538 --> 00:18:02,519
with medicine is an applied science

449
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:05,699
someone needs to get

450
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:07,619
those trials that's those studies and

451
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:10,620
apply them into what we call in medicine

452
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:13,739
clinical practice guidelines guidelines

453
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:16,319
that the medical boards and the medical

454
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,660
faculties across the world can agree

455
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:21,178
that this is a standard of care in

456
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:24,120
medicine why is this important that

457
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:26,038
leads me to the next Point liability

458
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:28,319
in malpractice how do we how do we

459
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,640
decide where whether a doctor was in the

460
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:34,259
right or in the wrong

461
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:37,080
it's something we we call a standard of

462
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:39,660
care and in animal malpractice Suite

463
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:43,199
you'll have City have um

464
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:45,660
a panel a peer a panel of peers experts

465
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,880
peers so if we had to look at the

466
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,860
pediatrician and explore a case and you

467
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,360
have to decide whether this pediatrician

468
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:54,779
acted

469
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:57,359
well or badly with any medicine you're

470
00:18:54,779 --> 00:19:00,779
going to have a group of expert peers

471
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:03,719
deciding whether that use of the

472
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:06,480
medicine that prescription was up to the

473
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,538
best standard of care possible

474
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,640
and this expert peer review these groups

475
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:14,579
are the doctors associations that we

476
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,259
know of the GPS the pediatricians the

477
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:18,599
geriatricians

478
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:20,940
and unfortunately when we talk about

479
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:23,519
cannabis these people have been left out

480
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,960
by the industry in general and I think

481
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,900
that is one of the biggest pain points

482
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,779
that I would like to communicate here we

483
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:33,500
we often look at the Mavericks in this

484
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:36,720
industry the pioneering cannabis doctors

485
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:39,779
who are are doing it all they're they're

486
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,579
doing amazing work but they're that

487
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:43,918
doctor in that part of the country

488
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:45,779
that's one guy

489
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,000
and that's not enough to support an

490
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:50,178
industry that will never be enough to

491
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,179
support a medical industry

492
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:56,400
which needs mainstream support and

493
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:59,580
doctors need mainstream support and we

494
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,280
need to have a bridge connecting

495
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:04,439
producers connecting policy makers

496
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:07,079
legislators

497
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,900
to the doctors and to the patients to

498
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:11,339
the waiting rooms of clinicians who

499
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:15,360
they're not cannabis doctors and they

500
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:17,099
never will be but they have cockroached

501
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,500
their doctors doctors and they've been

502
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:22,019
approached by an industry of cannabis

503
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,240
medicine Innovative medicine Innovative

504
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:27,500
natural medicine which more and more

505
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,120
patients now are are being very very

506
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,700
passionate about so that's definitely an

507
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:35,298
important point I'd like to communicate

508
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,919
off the bat about about how to go about

509
00:20:35,298 --> 00:20:40,079
starting physician education and

510
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,720
building them a framework for successful

511
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:47,720
medical cannabis industry in any country

512
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,720
nailed it and this is the thank you

513
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:53,700
and uh I'll see if I can Circle back so

514
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,860
we can speak a little bit more about the

515
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,380
technology that he's using it's it's a

516
00:20:55,859 --> 00:21:00,240
fantastic platform and it drives a lot

517
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,340
of the data from our clinics as well

518
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,220
like currently hello cannabis has 7 000

519
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:06,839
patients that we have all individually

520
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,298
prescribed and they've purchased

521
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:11,339
cannabis this is not anecdotal evidence

522
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:15,119
like this is real like we literally save

523
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:17,279
lives my my company hello cannabis is a

524
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:20,579
suffix for goodbye opioids I'm an opioid

525
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:22,740
Survivor from a tragic injury in a

526
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:25,319
wheelchair six months I have not taken a

527
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,839
painkiller or a pill for 11 years

528
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:30,178
and if I go to a pain clinic they're

529
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:32,099
giving me heroin I still do it every

530
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:34,380
single year they will prescribe me

531
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:36,839
heroin I will be a junkie I was a heroin

532
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,419
addict by hour four taking enough

533
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:41,519
medication to shoot up intravenously I

534
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:43,620
was taking it in a pill but I was taking

535
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:47,220
enough in a pill to shoot up three times

536
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:49,079
every four hours 24 hours a day seven

537
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,360
days a week for three months I get

538
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:53,579
goosebumps still talking about it I very

539
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:55,259
rarely speak about it publicly I was a

540
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:57,359
[ __ ] heroin addict

541
00:21:55,259 --> 00:22:00,000
flat out I just wasn't using a needle I

542
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:02,158
quit cold turkey after two months and

543
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,798
I've I have flatlined twice

544
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,320
and once was because of withdrawal

545
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:09,179
so like this this data works it's real

546
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:11,879
and bridging this Gap to these

547
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:14,460
Physicians is critically important and

548
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,559
if I I can Bridge into this because this

549
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,000
is exactly what Carmen I were talking

550
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,038
about out front which I found very

551
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,900
fascinating right now there are no

552
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:24,599
Physicians prescribing here

553
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:29,580
and my job originally my business

554
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:30,658
partner is a doctor and I own like as an

555
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:32,579
entrepreneur

556
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:34,620
long story short I was I was connected

557
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:36,960
with a lot of different surgeons and I

558
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:39,298
managed money so I knew rich people most

559
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,220
of them are doctors and surgeons and

560
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:43,319
they saw my recovery

561
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,940
so I was able to bridge that gap of

562
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:46,500
trust where they said like yo this guy's

563
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,779
a derivatives Trader like he's on the

564
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,400
cover of an investment magazine he is

565
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:52,379
not a stoner

566
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,120
and the little did they know that I was

567
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,520
on cannabis managing their money every

568
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:58,319
day and I was damn good at my job so I

569
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:59,759
already had that trust

570
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,798
and then I had another physician to do

571
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:04,200
it so we started this medical clinic

572
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:06,000
and I urge anybody that is opening up a

573
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,980
cannabis company here you're going to be

574
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,900
screwed if you do not have a clinic that

575
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,839
you were working with or starting on

576
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:15,360
your own that focuses on destigmatizing

577
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:16,740
cannabis in educating Physicians so it's

578
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:19,079
not just one

579
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,720
you get all of the different groups and

580
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:24,839
pound it I was knocking on doors every

581
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:27,058
day we have 78 Physicians that refer

582
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:28,619
patients to hello cannabis now I have

583
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:29,759
shook hands with literally every one of

584
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:31,439
them

585
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,940
this is important

586
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,919
it's the only way to do it you have to

587
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,900
get in front of these people and if you

588
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:38,820
are going to become a cultivator

589
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,340
you need distribution you need Revenue

590
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:44,339
I'm a businessman right

591
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:45,959
it's it's growing it it's it's not like

592
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:48,720
the Field of Dreams if you build it they

593
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:52,019
will come if you grow it it will sell

594
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,860
Canada has sold 17 of everything we've

595
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:54,900
grown

596
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:57,658
name a commodity

597
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:00,240
name any industry that can survive if

598
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:02,280
you sell 17 of all of your production

599
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,919
imagine if all of the coffee Growers

600
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:06,960
only sold 17 of the beans you're

601
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:09,360
bankrupty are one

602
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,038
right like you need distribution and

603
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:12,538
right now the distribution is through

604
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:14,519
medical channels and in order to get

605
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:16,558
that medical Channel open you need

606
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:18,720
people like this and you need this is

607
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:20,038
free advice you are going to be screwed

608
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,058
if you do not have doctors that are

609
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:22,619
prescribing because you won't have

610
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:23,639
patience which means you won't have

611
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:24,959
Revenue

612
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,940
which the only way you're going to

613
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,880
survive is burning shareholders money

614
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:32,519
that's it and getting more money to burn

615
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,799
so it's very important and this is

616
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:36,839
something that Karma's doing over in New

617
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:39,119
Zealand and it's very special that they

618
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:40,619
have a government that supports us and

619
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,379
she can speak with respect to how the

620
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:45,538
medical program is working there and how

621
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:48,620
they are able to prescribe and the pain

622
00:24:45,538 --> 00:24:48,619
points that they faced

623
00:24:53,759 --> 00:25:00,119
in place since September 2021 it came

624
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:02,339
into place on the 30th of September and

625
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:06,178
Helios launched our first product on the

626
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:08,158
4th of October just four days later

627
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:10,259
um one of the things that I wanted to

628
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,200
share is that our medicinal cannabis

629
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:15,839
scheme covers CBD and THC so it covers

630
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,538
all cannabinoids and any doctor in New

631
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:20,099
Zealand can prescribe for any condition

632
00:25:17,538 --> 00:25:23,158
and I think that

633
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:25,740
um by having CBD under that prescribing

634
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:27,900
Laura look at that in two ways compared

635
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,359
to what I see here in Europe in some

636
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,940
cases I think it's Overkill that you

637
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:35,519
need a doctor to prescribe CBD

638
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:38,880
but in other cases the rules are very

639
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:40,980
clear unlike here in Europe where CBD is

640
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,900
a medicine and it is prescribed by

641
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,700
doctors and that has actually been a

642
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,900
route where doctors have been able to

643
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,940
get

644
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:51,000
to understand cannabis a little bit

645
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:53,460
better by starting with prescribing CBD

646
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,220
before moving on to prescribe maybe a

647
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:59,038
balanced product before moving on to

648
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:02,900
thinking about THC so it's been a an

649
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:05,400
easy route in for some of our GPS

650
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:09,000
but we've had to really focus on

651
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:11,220
education so Helios even before the

652
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,038
scheme came into place we held medical

653
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:17,460
conferences medcan we had experts from

654
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:19,500
around the world come so Professor Mike

655
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,259
Barnes from the UK some of you may have

656
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,720
heard of him we had him come to New

657
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:28,500
Zealand and do some education programs

658
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:31,620
for us we go to two doctors conferences

659
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,538
every year and in October we're going to

660
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:36,178
have a couple of events where doctors

661
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:37,379
are coming along to hillius to see what

662
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:40,440
we do

663
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:42,539
the reason I bring that up is that that

664
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,519
is probably the biggest game changer

665
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:47,819
we've seen around breaking down stigma

666
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:50,158
is actually having doctors and

667
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:54,119
politicians come to our site

668
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:56,220
and see how we make medicinal cannabis

669
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:57,778
even the most

670
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,659
um

671
00:26:57,778 --> 00:27:02,759
skeptical let's be polite skeptical

672
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:05,520
politicians when they've come to Helios

673
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:07,740
and they've come into our facility and

674
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,658
we've dressed up all in our white gowns

675
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,759
and our hear Nets and our shoe covers

676
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:13,080
and we've gone into the cultivation

677
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:16,140
facility

678
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:19,079
have changed their minds about cannabis

679
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:21,840
and about what that cannabis as a

680
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:24,558
medicine as we go into this facility one

681
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:29,038
of our politicians who was dead against

682
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:30,119
cannabis said to me but Carmen it's so

683
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:33,599
clean

684
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:38,579
right I said yes we're making medicines

685
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:40,740
build it she said but yes it's so clean

686
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:43,379
yes we're making medicine we're making

687
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,778
medicines and so I think that in her

688
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,640
mind the view of cannabis as a medicine

689
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:51,659
was very different I think she thought

690
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:54,480
we were growing in a shed with foil on

691
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:57,179
the windows and you know it was super

692
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,940
dodgy and so being being able to come

693
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:01,919
and see the Precision to look along the

694
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,080
plants and see that every single one is

695
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,700
the same height to go into the

696
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:08,819
extraction facility and have our

697
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,679
extraction manager explain in detail how

698
00:28:08,819 --> 00:28:13,019
we pull out the cannabinoids from the

699
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,659
plant and how we do that the same way

700
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:17,278
every single time has been a really big

701
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:20,039
way that we've been able to break down

702
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:22,619
some of the stigma for politicians or

703
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:24,599
for doctors and really understand that

704
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:27,418
what we are making as a medicine so

705
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:28,969
that's one of the the insights I wanted

706
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:32,069
to share with this audience today

707
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:32,068
[Music]

708
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,820
what I love about that story is uh in

709
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,159
New Zealand they were actually able to

710
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:43,439
get the doctors to come to them it

711
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:45,600
wasn't so easy in Canada

712
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,220
but it's very true the stigma right

713
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,778
there like they think about cannabis the

714
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,640
only thing that they've seen is on

715
00:28:48,778 --> 00:28:53,400
television when they're watching cops

716
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,679
and they see somebody breaking kicking

717
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,200
open a door and in the basement or in

718
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,059
like an attic with mold and foil and

719
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,558
black black tape covering everything

720
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:04,619
like they think that that's how medicine

721
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:06,658
is made that it's it's baffling when

722
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:08,879
people walk into a real cultivation

723
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:11,278
facility for the first time particularly

724
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,100
doctors and precisely that they're like

725
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:16,319
this is very cleanly yeah you can eat

726
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:18,298
off the floor it's GMP like what we make

727
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:21,480
medicine man like like this is a

728
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:25,440
surprise like it's it's very very very

729
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:27,960
surprising how their mind and the stigma

730
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,880
even after legalization in Canada in

731
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,679
Canada is still there years later until

732
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,960
they actually see it with the first hand

733
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,460
or until they actually hear a real

734
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,278
success story from somebody that's

735
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:40,200
eloquent not just like y'all look I'm in

736
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:41,700
a lot of pain and like I just smoke weed

737
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,860
and I feel better like they're not going

738
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,580
to give any credibility to that but if

739
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:46,619
they're hearing it from another

740
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:49,259
physician or they're seeing it firsthand

741
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:51,839
it starts swaying and and it's it's

742
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:54,419
still in Canada we do tours all the time

743
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:56,278
and that shock and awe is still there

744
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:59,038
with Physicians being like

745
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:00,480
this it's harmless right like how the

746
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:02,339
hell do you walk into a cultivation room

747
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,019
and think like this kills people

748
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:05,339
there's literally zero deaths because of

749
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:09,058
this plan

750
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:10,939
like zero I like I've died twice because

751
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:13,798
of something like heroin

752
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:15,840
cannabis is zero like this is this is

753
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:20,278
this is real truth here

754
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:21,658
so I I I'd like to uh find a much easier

755
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:24,480
Bridge

756
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:25,980
um uh to a legal perspective in Germany

757
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,298
and it's uh it's eluding me right now

758
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,159
I've been pretty smooth with the

759
00:30:27,298 --> 00:30:31,859
transitions

760
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:34,559
but uh what what I what I really think I

761
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:35,939
should really talk about here is in

762
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:37,200
Germany right now right now it's only

763
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,360
medically

764
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,580
and Recreation as you heard Peter

765
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:43,918
speaking earlier it's still very much up

766
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:46,139
in air and we've been speaking in Berlin

767
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,820
for six seven years now where people

768
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:50,038
thought it was like six months away from

769
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:51,898
stores opening and people running in and

770
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:54,898
buying weed and smoking on the streets

771
00:30:51,898 --> 00:30:57,000
it's it's not the case

772
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:58,678
um and slovenia's I highly recommend

773
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,380
going through the medical platform first

774
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:02,940
and we can help avoid the pitfalls of

775
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,380
transitioning from medical to

776
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,058
recreational because there's a need for

777
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,740
both absolutely

778
00:31:06,058 --> 00:31:09,538
and I'd like Kai to be able to explain

779
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:12,240
what what he saw in the medical Market

780
00:31:09,538 --> 00:31:14,398
in Germany and hopefully he can be able

781
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,798
to add some color and context on how

782
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:18,859
this can benefit Slovenia and the

783
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:21,179
Balkans in general in Europe in general

784
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:24,240
because I do believe that the medical

785
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:27,179
Market in Germany is set up not to fail

786
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,399
it's set up to succeed it's just still

787
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:31,798
very new and

788
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:34,558
the doors have not not enough doors have

789
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:36,359
been knocked on yet so to speak but uh I

790
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:38,759
think the German Medical Market is

791
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:40,259
actually better than Canada's

792
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:42,298
um it's just not

793
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:44,759
um sophisticated or I should not use

794
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:47,819
that word with Germans sorry

795
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:49,919
um it's not uh fleshed out and efficient

796
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:51,898
enough yet just because it's still in

797
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,538
more or less trial stage Canada's been

798
00:31:51,898 --> 00:31:56,398
operating for a while but uh if we had

799
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:57,898
the rules like Germany

800
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:00,119
um I think we would be able to help a

801
00:31:57,898 --> 00:32:03,898
lot more people and be able to grow and

802
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:07,139
sell this product a lot more and that

803
00:32:03,898 --> 00:32:09,239
health and revenue is actually a

804
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:11,460
synergetic thing and that's coming from

805
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,819
a businessman that's a an opioid

806
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:16,620
Survivor that puts Health First and the

807
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:18,538
money was a byproduct and like I said I

808
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:20,158
was not kidding when I say my company

809
00:32:18,538 --> 00:32:22,798
has sold over 50 million dollars worth

810
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:25,559
of cannabis and the whole ethos is

811
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:27,839
Health goodbye opioids hell of cannabis

812
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:31,379
so what did you see in the medical

813
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:34,019
Market in Germany and how can how can

814
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:38,580
they more or less learn from what

815
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:41,038
Germany has done because it's still slow

816
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:45,599
yeah yeah for sure for sure so we

817
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:49,140
started 2014 with 1 000 patients they

818
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:51,178
had an exception and could obtain

819
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:53,640
cannabis from the pharmacies and then

820
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:56,640
there was this one case uh where this

821
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:59,700
patient grew his own on cannabis on his

822
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:03,538
balcony was prohibited he got a criminal

823
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:05,580
offense and he fought this thing and in

824
00:33:03,538 --> 00:33:07,980
the end he um at the highest

825
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:09,599
administrative Court he was admitted to

826
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,339
grow his cannabis on the balcony the

827
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,500
German government obviously didn't like

828
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:15,119
it that all patients can grow their

829
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,798
cannabis on their balconies so they set

830
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:19,979
up a whole new law the Cannabis as

831
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:22,980
medicine Act that came into force in

832
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:24,839
2017 so we started with 1 000 patients

833
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,819
and now we have we don't count the

834
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:28,379
patients that's the problem we only call

835
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:31,379
the prescriptions count the

836
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:33,120
prescriptions uh which are reimbursed

837
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,399
from the public health insurance

838
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:38,278
insurances

839
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:40,678
um so but probably we have to 200 250

840
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:42,960
000 patients right now the market volume

841
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:44,340
is we don't have exact figures on that

842
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,740
as well because we have a lot of

843
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:49,439
self-paying patients which don't

844
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,740
reimburse which don't apply for

845
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:55,320
reimbursement at the health insurances

846
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:57,419
the market size is probably between 300

847
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:59,460
and 400 million somewhere between that

848
00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:01,860
so it's a tiny Market it's not a very

849
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:04,038
big Market but still very fancy

850
00:34:01,859 --> 00:34:08,579
conditions here

851
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:11,579
and that's the uh the the the thing we

852
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:14,759
imported 25 tons of dried flowers last

853
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:18,480
year 10 tons were delivered to to

854
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:23,220
pharmacies and you don't see any real

855
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:25,800
growth increase in dried flowers for

856
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:27,838
public health insurers anymore so the

857
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,899
the future of the market definitely is

858
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:31,940
the self-payer market

859
00:34:29,898 --> 00:34:34,319
where people

860
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:37,918
obtain cannabis from from our

861
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,559
prescriptions and don't even think about

862
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:43,019
reimbursement or imply apply to apply

863
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:45,418
for that and

864
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:48,059
that is a

865
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:50,940
the future of the market for for sure

866
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:53,460
and maybe one of the or The only

867
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:55,639
positive aspect about the new draft

868
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,260
which the federal health Ministry

869
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:00,960
represented two weeks ago or three weeks

870
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:03,720
ago is that cannabis is removed from the

871
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,179
narcotic act yes so it's not a narcotic

872
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:08,039
anymore it's a zoo generous it's a

873
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:10,799
product it's a commodity Zoe generous

874
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:12,539
you can say even stricter regulated and

875
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,940
controlled than before but it's not a

876
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:16,320
narcotic anymore

877
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:18,059
and that's the future maybe that helps

878
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,280
for doctors as well for education

879
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:23,099
purposes so it doesn't have the stigma

880
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:26,280
of a narcotic anymore but

881
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:28,500
um somewhere between an all commodity

882
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:31,859
and the medicine we have to figure that

883
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,059
out exactly if science progresses

884
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:34,679
Etc

885
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:38,219
and

886
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:41,460
um then as you said it if you prescribe

887
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:44,879
a narcotic The Physician has obliged to

888
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:47,039
do a risk benefit analysis uh how big is

889
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,579
the risk that the patient gets addicted

890
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:52,858
and that the situation gets even worse

891
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:55,140
and these analysis

892
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:57,119
um is the Physicians don't have to do

893
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:59,759
that anymore so they can prescribe it

894
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,858
and please pay attention on that if you

895
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,980
set up the medical regime

896
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:06,779
um any indication is possible for

897
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,480
cannabis and it's not shouldn't be

898
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,760
restricted to like in Portugal to seven

899
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,980
indications

900
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:16,500
or like in the UK where you can

901
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:19,079
prescribe cannabis only for very few

902
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:23,400
conditions make it open cannabis has the

903
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:24,900
potential to to help anyone and yeah the

904
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,720
future definitely is in the episode

905
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:30,619
prayer Market absolutely thank you very

906
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,618
much so

907
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,980
I'll I'll highlight a few key points in

908
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:39,659
uh in the German Market the

909
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,639
reimbursement program is something that

910
00:36:39,659 --> 00:36:43,139
is astonishing

911
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:46,139
um they they have a very strong

912
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:47,879
reimbursement program in Canada we have

913
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:51,539
what's called ohip it's like insurance

914
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:53,220
coverage cannabis is not only not

915
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:55,739
included in this this is the best part

916
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:58,618
we have what's called an excise stamp

917
00:36:55,739 --> 00:37:01,199
it's like a syntax so things like

918
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:03,480
cigarettes they have a special rapper

919
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:05,699
with a special stamp where you have to

920
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,838
pay an extra big tax because it's bad

921
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:09,480
for you

922
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:12,960
our cannabis medicine

923
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:15,900
has an excise stamp on it medicine

924
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,760
that is still even we are by far the

925
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,700
most fleshed out and sophisticated of

926
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:23,339
the G20 Nations for cannabis and we have

927
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:25,799
been lobbying and I've been sitting on

928
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:28,199
boards and sitting on the Canadian

929
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,539
cannabis Council I'm a member of the

930
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:32,759
Canadian Chamber of Commerce like one of

931
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:35,639
the lead cannabis advisors there

932
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,980
and if anybody has a story

933
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:40,019
of who qualifies for medical cannabis

934
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:43,500
and it's real medical efficacy it's it's

935
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:46,380
me and just with my own company we have

936
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:48,838
7 000 patients never mind the half

937
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:53,099
million others that are using this

938
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:54,000
product and we get taxed as a syntax on

939
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:57,359
it

940
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,300
it's nuts whereas in Germany they are

941
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:02,819
offering reimbursement for it and I urge

942
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,079
policy makers here in Slovenia to

943
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,240
understand that this is a real medicine

944
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,740
it's irrefutable the only reason that

945
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:09,719
it's still like that in Canada is

946
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:11,578
because of bureaucracy and the Genies

947
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:14,459
out of the bottle and they're very much

948
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:16,380
enjoying the the monetary tax benefits

949
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:19,019
out of that excise stamp

950
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:21,599
right like trust me I like I I watch

951
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:22,800
Netflix mini series of corruption I'd

952
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,359
laugh saying that was [ __ ] Tuesday

953
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,119
morning for me

954
00:38:24,358 --> 00:38:29,940
like it's it's it's dark it's it's

955
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,619
really really dark and we're very young

956
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,300
and the knowledge and experience that

957
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:36,180
we've had weighs like a very very very

958
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,680
heavy heavy weight on us and so I got to

959
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:39,299
commend Germany for being able to follow

960
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,519
this reimbursement program for real

961
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,200
medicine that really works there's no

962
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:44,159
denying this this is not anecdotal

963
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:46,199
evidence

964
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,960
it's not anecdotal anymore it's not me

965
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:51,299
standing up seven years ago saying I am

966
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,000
not mentally disabled I'm a competent

967
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,099
person that is on cannabis right now and

968
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,739
I am a sophisticated professional take

969
00:38:56,099 --> 00:39:00,838
my word for it and that's how it started

970
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:02,699
this is now no longer anecdotal or me

971
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,019
talking on a Podium this is irrefutable

972
00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:07,319
medical data

973
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:10,139
real so it does require reimbursement I

974
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:12,780
am unfamiliar with the ins and outs of

975
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:14,639
the medical program here in Slovenia is

976
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:18,260
there reimbursement

977
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,259
super do that with cannabis too

978
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,760
perfect perfect now let's educate The

979
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:26,098
Physician so we can help people and get

980
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,599
them off of much worse narcotics and

981
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:30,599
have them reimburse for medicine that

982
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,539
works please let us help because the

983
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:36,000
combination of all of these experts here

984
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:38,400
will ideally put together in my opinion

985
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,639
a perfect system

986
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,200
methodically doing it's a lot harder but

987
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:45,239
but you get it

988
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:48,439
speak of somebody that's doing it

989
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:50,578
there's a transition of the day

990
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:53,400
Nema is one of the gentlemen that is

991
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:55,380
doing it and we've met around the world

992
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,240
at different conferences I I'm telling

993
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,740
you this this man has a brain that's not

994
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:01,858
from planet Earth

995
00:39:58,739 --> 00:40:05,039
and you're right he's also humbled but

996
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:07,078
he's a sharp one and he specializes in

997
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:10,139
in extraction he specializes in

998
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:12,119
distribution and clearly he's part of a

999
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:13,500
major pilot program in a very

1000
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:15,599
sophisticated country such as

1001
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:19,139
Switzerland and

1002
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,519
Nema can you please explain how the

1003
00:40:19,139 --> 00:40:21,960
medical program was originally working

1004
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:24,780
and now you were part of the

1005
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,960
recreational pilot program

1006
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:29,880
so the medical cannabis in Switzerland

1007
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,780
has been legal for many years

1008
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:36,358
and since last year it's become much

1009
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:41,180
easier for doctors to prescribe

1010
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:41,179
before it was only for if I recall

1011
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,380
I didn't do it

1012
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:51,839
hello

1013
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:54,960
for four indications basically

1014
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:58,500
if you're just before dying you can take

1015
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,980
cannabis so uh that changed which is

1016
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:05,280
also good but also in in Switzerland

1017
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:08,159
there's a lack of education for doctors

1018
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,140
I just went to a doctor my doctor

1019
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:12,659
wanting him to prescribe me medical

1020
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:15,179
cannabis and he wanted to send me to a

1021
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:17,639
psychiatrist so where will I get my

1022
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:20,279
cannabis not from them you see a theme

1023
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:22,799
here right it's to come full circle this

1024
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:26,480
is the biggest theme that's why you said

1025
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,480
sophisticated country I

1026
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:31,680
um so the pilot trails are recreational

1027
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:33,960
there's nothing to do with medicinal

1028
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:36,179
cannabis

1029
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,260
um maybe to explain a bit about the

1030
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:40,559
trials

1031
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:43,440
we have 26 cantons in in Switzerland and

1032
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:45,299
you can have a pilot project in one

1033
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,599
Canton

1034
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:51,420
you can have up to 5 000 participants in

1035
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:52,800
that pilot project you have to be over

1036
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:55,559
18.

1037
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,599
and you have to smoke cannabis or

1038
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:59,880
consume cannabis so if you don't consume

1039
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,119
cannabis you cannot take part in the

1040
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,119
trial

1041
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,579
yeah

1042
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:09,479
um

1043
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:12,780
the products range from hash oil Vapes

1044
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,559
flowers for now Edibles will come as

1045
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,500
well

1046
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:18,059
maximum of 20 THC

1047
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,280
again there

1048
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:23,219
I don't know where that came from so all

1049
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,619
the data we collect above below above 20

1050
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:29,239
percent with we won't collect that it's

1051
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:34,079
only up to 25 20 THC

1052
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:38,459
they want also ratios like 2010 with CBD

1053
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:42,000
one one so these are the the varieties

1054
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:45,240
that are grown and was actually quite

1055
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:49,400
challenging to make a hash with 20 but

1056
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:49,399
it's possible it's always simple

1057
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,400
but it's possible

1058
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:56,880
um

1059
00:42:53,400 --> 00:43:00,599
to get these pilot projects it's uh it's

1060
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:03,140
a long way it's a lot of energy a little

1061
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:07,160
bit of money you need a research team

1062
00:43:03,139 --> 00:43:09,838
ours is from the eth from Zurich

1063
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:12,960
and you need a topic what are you

1064
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:14,578
researching so the differences of for

1065
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,300
example differences of consumption

1066
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:19,740
cannabis in the city and in the

1067
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:22,140
in the

1068
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:25,559
um not in the City Country thank you

1069
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:26,400
thank you so that that's something

1070
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:30,239
um

1071
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:32,880
that that costs money obviously then you

1072
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:34,618
have to if you are producing with plants

1073
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,519
you have to have a certification which

1074
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:40,318
is normally jacp

1075
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:42,900
you definitely need a a track and Trace

1076
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:44,838
system in place that's very important

1077
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:48,660
for the government

1078
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:51,920
and that's more or less for the

1079
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:54,960
production of the plant side then

1080
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:57,599
extracted is extracted there's no law

1081
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,420
how you need to extract or or you can do

1082
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,700
it as you wish basically you just need

1083
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:06,440
to have that so if you say you will

1084
00:44:02,699 --> 00:44:09,118
extract a hundred kilos at 18

1085
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,220
THC then you can calculate how much

1086
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,680
distillate you have and you need to

1087
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:16,739
apply that put that in your application

1088
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:19,618
how many plans how much you extract how

1089
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:20,459
much a distillate you have

1090
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:23,760
Etc

1091
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:26,220
then for the the products which we

1092
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,900
specialize in in Charlie's lab are Vapes

1093
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:31,858
and oils

1094
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:34,559
so uh the oils do not need any novel

1095
00:44:31,858 --> 00:44:37,318
food or any approval so THC is okay in

1096
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:39,779
oils but not in CBD

1097
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:43,619
also question mark

1098
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:46,940
um but I'm not complaining just showing

1099
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:46,940
makes no sense

1100
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:52,019
um

1101
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,480
you don't need a GMP in the lab

1102
00:44:52,019 --> 00:44:55,759
but you need traceability that's that's

1103
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,460
very important

1104
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,900
it took us two years to get this pilot

1105
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:03,300
project

1106
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:05,460
I I think every other country will

1107
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:08,160
legalize before Switzerland we're just

1108
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,818
very very slow

1109
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:10,739
um

1110
00:45:08,818 --> 00:45:14,039
but I think we will get there the

1111
00:45:10,739 --> 00:45:16,139
legalization process is already started

1112
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:16,980
um they're just many entities that have

1113
00:45:16,139 --> 00:45:19,858
to

1114
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:23,460
give their opinion police Ministry of

1115
00:45:19,858 --> 00:45:25,440
Health some consumer protecting

1116
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:28,440
associations

1117
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:31,318
Etc but I'm sure we will get there one

1118
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,659
day and just just stay positive and

1119
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:35,519
promote this plant

1120
00:45:33,659 --> 00:45:37,318
I think that's the right way to go that

1121
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:38,460
would be my advice to you just stay

1122
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:42,440
positive

1123
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:45,179
and uh Lobby no just kidding

1124
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,380
loving does work to some degree

1125
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:49,259
um but uh

1126
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:51,480
it's not a fun process either so I I I'm

1127
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,099
really uh grateful again to be in this

1128

00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:09,019
more time

1135
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:16,680
we have time for one question

1136
00:46:14,219 --> 00:46:19,389
does anyone have one

1137
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:22,519
oh right here we go

1138
00:46:19,389 --> 00:46:22,519
[Music]

1139
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:32,099
Hey guys does this work uh California

1140
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:34,139
breeder and plant tissue culture

1141
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:37,980
scientist here so I've been in the

1142
00:46:34,139 --> 00:46:41,759
trenches uh for uh six years so you know

1143
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:45,659
know how it is uh you really need to uh

1144
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:47,760
recognize the black markets uh presence

1145
00:46:45,659 --> 00:46:50,818
worldwide when we're talking about this

1146
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:53,960
can you guys room rock or uh comment on

1147
00:46:50,818 --> 00:46:56,759
some of the regulatory form medical

1148
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:59,460
needing to be or or like the bureaucracy

1149
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:02,040
needing to be smooth enough that if

1150
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:03,960
someone has access to to their plug you

1151
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:05,338
know they're illegal and then the legal

1152
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:08,338
why they're going to go to the medical

1153
00:47:05,338 --> 00:47:10,078
and uh what advantage do you does the

1154
00:47:08,338 --> 00:47:12,119
medical bring why doesn't need to be

1155
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,579
cheaper better you know like what are

1156
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:17,400
your comments on that

1157
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:21,900
great great question and it's coming

1158
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:24,119
from a tissue culture and like basically

1159
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:26,280
uh seed junkie as well that's been

1160
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:27,599
traveling around so respect on that in

1161
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,579
Canada is very similar to California

1162
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:32,640
with the dichotomy between the illicit

1163
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:34,859
market and the legal Market

1164
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:37,500
um I I'd love to jump in and finish that

1165
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:38,639
but please yeah I think I think that's a

1166
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,900
really good question when you look at

1167
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:42,239
the situation in Europe and the

1168
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,039
bureaucracy and and as the legally the

1169
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:46,739
legal experts have told us it's a lot

1170
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:48,179
about the conventions and a lot about

1171
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:51,239
um in Switzerland we're seeing pilot

1172
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:52,379
projects so scientific studies now in

1173
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:55,739
business we say you know show me the

1174
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:58,019
money in science we say show me the data

1175
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:59,578
now does it work

1176
00:47:58,019 --> 00:48:01,380
um and we've already discussed today

1177
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:04,619
there's a lot of Studies have been

1178
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:06,240
looking into how recreational Cannabis

1179
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:07,800
or cannabis has caused harm but we

1180
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:08,879
haven't really had funding in showing

1181
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,400
why

1182
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,619
in a context where a patient can choose

1183
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,720
to keep getting the the illicit Market

1184
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:18,420
why should they choose to go to the

1185
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:19,199
medical market right it and needs to

1186
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,500
work

1187
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:24,659
and we need to show data that that it

1188
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,280
works and that data is showing patients

1189
00:48:24,659 --> 00:48:27,719
getting better

1190
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,640
um my opinion is this is where Tech

1191
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:32,519
comes in and this is where we need to

1192
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:34,618
have med tech to be able to show that

1193
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:36,960
our patients are getting better this is

1194
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:39,720
why uh advocacy coming from the medical

1195
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,358
aspect is so strong you don't you don't

1196
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:44,519
want to believe me look look at look at

1197
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:45,838
this patient speak to this patient he'll

1198
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:48,300
tell you his life story he'll tell you

1199
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:50,219
about his child in PD who went to a

1200
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,420
pediatric doctor and used cannabis

1201
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:53,879
medicine he'll tell you about his mother

1202
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:56,400
who used cannabis medicine with her

1203
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:59,000
geriatrician and when we have that data

1204
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,318
we'll be able to show and give

1205
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,480
motivation for why people should choose

1206
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:04,980
medical over illicit because we need

1207
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,500
like you very well said we need to

1208
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:09,480
remember that we're not in a vacuum here

1209
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:11,400
uh the illicit Market is still with us

1210
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,900
and it still offers an option and we

1211
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:16,380
need to be better than that and show for

1212
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:18,599
it so what he's reiterating is that the

1213
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:22,079
the medical efficacy is real and as

1214
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:25,440
people become more educated the

1215
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:27,359
stigma of going to an illicit Market or

1216
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,099
not to speak from a business standpoint

1217
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:30,960
because I I know both sides I've

1218
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:33,599
straddled them like I said I'm a Dutch

1219
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:36,539
guy from Vancouver like BC Bud right

1220
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:38,519
like it was like we basically supplied

1221
00:49:36,539 --> 00:49:40,739
all of North America with cannabis until

1222
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:43,199
California kind of opened up and then

1223
00:49:40,739 --> 00:49:44,939
they became the American supplier what

1224
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:46,980
will get people going to Medical instead

1225
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,240
of the illicit Market is a system like

1226
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,760
in Germany where there's reimbursement

1227
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:51,899
free weed that right that's good

1228
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:54,060
incentive

1229
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,680
right and the other in Canada we at

1230
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:57,900
least have we have tax write-offs for it

1231
00:49:55,679 --> 00:50:00,019
we have grants for medical devices

1232
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:02,818
things like any

1233
00:50:00,019 --> 00:50:05,179
non-combustion medical device so the

1234
00:50:02,818 --> 00:50:05,179
incentive

1235
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,760
um we can actually now replicate the

1236
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:13,919
distribution right I haven't we're

1237
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,200
launching an online pharmacy for my 7

1238
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:19,019
000 patients same day delivery it's just

1239
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:20,578
like amazon.com except everything is is

1240
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:23,219
wheat

1241
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:24,960
and it's shopping online you buy it it's

1242
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:26,578
with your credit card and boom the same

1243
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,440
day it's coming there like find a plug

1244
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:30,119
that's going to do that I got it I will

1245
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,619
crush them and that's the whole point

1246
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:34,200
you got to be able to compete on price

1247
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:35,338
compete on quality and the fastest way

1248
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:36,719
to compete on price on the medical

1249
00:50:35,338 --> 00:50:38,578
Market is to re have the government

1250
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:40,559
reimburse them we don't have that

1251
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:44,220
privilege in Canada so we have to beat

1252
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:46,858
them on ease of access quality and price

1253
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:48,719
can I jump in here as well one of the

1254
00:50:46,858 --> 00:50:51,179
things that we discussed is a panel

1255
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:53,578
before we came up is that an adult use

1256
00:50:51,179 --> 00:50:55,318
and a medical Market can exist really

1257
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:57,180
well together

1258
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:59,039
and that

1259
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:01,558
um you know from Cannabis as a medicine

1260
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:04,019
perspective we are giving cannabis as a

1261
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:06,420
medicine to someone who is sick whether

1262
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:09,480
mentally or physically in many cases

1263
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:12,720
those people are immunocompromised and

1264
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:14,099
so the the consistency being able to

1265
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:16,618
deliver something that is free of

1266
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:19,019
pesticides free of heavy metals it has

1267
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:23,160
it's the same strain every time that has

1268
00:51:19,019 --> 00:51:24,838
the same profile every time but also

1269
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:27,899
that has that wrap around medical

1270
00:51:24,838 --> 00:51:30,299
support I think is really key price is

1271
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:32,039
always going to come into it but for me

1272
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:34,200
when we're talking about cannabis as a

1273
00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:36,358
medicine it's all of those things that

1274
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:39,379
are really really important and someone

1275
00:51:36,358 --> 00:51:43,259
who maybe is using cannabis medicinally

1276
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:44,880
but not as part of a medicinal Market

1277
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:47,520
um just one other thing to share there

1278
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,500
is that in New Zealand we're able to

1279
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:52,139
bring strains from the illicit Market

1280
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,699
into the legal Market we have a route to

1281
00:51:52,139 --> 00:51:55,980
be able to do that through our medicinal

1282
00:51:53,699 --> 00:51:58,078
cannabis scheme in a declaration process

1283
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:00,300
where there are no questions asked

1284
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,980
around where the strain came from and

1285
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:04,380
there's some really interesting strains

1286
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:06,480
coming from the black market where

1287
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:09,000
people as green fairies have been really

1288
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,219
focused on medical outcomes

1289
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,159
and then now we're able to bring those

1290
00:52:11,219 --> 00:52:16,318
into a medical setting also with wrap

1291
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:19,078
around Healthcare support from their

1292
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:22,338
doctor from their Pharmacy for someone

1293
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:22,339
who really needs that help

1294
00:52:24,019 --> 00:52:28,500
that was fantastic let's hear it again

1295
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:31,879
for the whole panel again unfortunately

1296
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:33,780
we are out of time I know it was very uh

1297
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:35,880
very interesting but I'm sure everyone

1298
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:38,220
can continue their conversations in the

1299
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,960
salon in the hallway and everything this

1300
00:52:38,219 --> 00:52:42,598
