1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,489
the next person I'm bringing up right

2
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:05,400
now he's going to talk about all kind of

3
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,830
international things he is the CEO or

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,410
the managing director of the multiverse

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:18,618
and he's here for you right now let's

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:18,618
hear it for the one the only me

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,190
useless

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,300
yes

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:46,580
oh there we go they don't give me a

10
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,960
podium to stand behind here and hide

11
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:50,670
well hopefully a little different than

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,870
what you were used to they're some of

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,640
the comments from that last one will be

14
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:56,489
indicative of some of the things I go

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,200
over but Nick Easley really good to be

16
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,000
here back in Berlin this is the third

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,580
year helping with ICBC and really

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,980
starting to create a global industry of

19
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,929
the largest consumer good in the history

20
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,730
of the world so really excited to share

21
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,410
a little bit today I'm CEO of 3c

22
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,050
consulting I started that almost 13

23
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,489
years ago in Colorado and also managing

24
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,890
director of multiverse capital private

25
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:18,420
equity and venture capital funds they

26
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,010
said there's a little button here it's

27
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,280
got a laser on it which will probably

28
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:25,710
get me in trouble just see here perfect

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,170
just a quick disclaimer I'm not a lawyer

30
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:31,019
I'm not a CPA I'm not a certified

31
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,150
financial analyst I run venture capital

32
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,670
private equity funds I've also seen this

33
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,300
industry evolved for over 13 years from

34
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,180
Colorado 2006 first kind of bonafide

35
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,099
commercial medical program starting

36
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:46,380
2008-2009 first adult use recreational

37
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:48,868
state even more legal than Amsterdam

38
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:50,728
ever even wanted to be started working

39
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:53,159
in California multiple other states we

40
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:55,439
have operations in 24 States have done

41
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,719
licenses in 13 countries worked in over

42
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,759
20 countries now so really have gotten

43
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,109
to see the US market the global market

44
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,899
and from the consulting with working

45
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:05,879
with clients really have understood what

46
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,639
works what doesn't where as capital

47
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:10,258
powerful and really positioning like the

48
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,149
last panel said it's not about trying to

49
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:14,039
be Philip Morris or Pfizer it's being

50
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,170
bought by them and like how to position

51
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:18,629
things for mas versus private and public

52
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:20,909
so I've seen all sides and also I look

53
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:24,030
at markets based on the market for

54
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:25,859
cannabis itself not so much it's like

55
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,169
your country so if I offend your ideas

56
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,270
or your country or your policies I

57
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:31,679
apologize in advance but I'm not

58
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,689
guessing on what I'm going to talk about

59
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,270
here this is the truth from the trenches

60
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:38,669
of this industry just a little bit of

61
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,709
background originally I'm like from farm

62
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:42,000
country in Wisconsin I was a crypto

63
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:43,590
linguist for the Air Force I speak

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,080
Spanish a couple of their languages

65
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,509
unfortunately my Dutch Danish Greek

66
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,070
Greek and German are not very good so

67
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:51,329
thank you very much for our translators

68
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,519
there

69
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,219
from starting in Colorado like ask that

70
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,040
first state only six million people but

71
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:00,990
we learned specifically what not to do

72
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,729
which is more important as you're

73
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,159
investing in navigating this landscape

74
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:06,719
than knowing what to do so not repeating

75
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,389
the same mistakes that others have done

76
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,400
time and time again with product recalls

77
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:14,399
are building a giant indoor facility

78
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,840
that costs let's say four four hundred

79
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,189
and fifty five hundred dollars a square

80
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,680
foot to build compared to big

81
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:21,530
greenhouses so we see what works we see

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,230
what doesn't and sometimes indoor works

83
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,759
depending on the state of the country so

84
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:28,379
I've done this long enough to really see

85
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:30,780
what's working what's not working what

86
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:33,120
teams are really turning into good

87
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,039
investments and what to completely avoid

88
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,629
and in some of these markets it'd be

89
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,549
better to just put your money in a pile

90
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:39,930
and burn it then invest into some of

91
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,610
those markets so I want to make sure you

92
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,599
know how to not lose your money if

93
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,720
you're going to be investing in the

94
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:48,150
space so let's just kind of like look

95
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:50,310
like here at the world I mean we started

96
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,050
in Colorado I mean this plant we

97
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,300
inherited it's like hundreds of

98
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,189
thousands of years our our species has

99
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,360
been working with this plant like I

100
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:59,579
didn't invent this plant

101
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,190
you didn't our great-grandparents passed

102
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,810
this down to us and it's our job now to

103
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:05,639
create a responsible industry to like

104
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,039
pass on to future generations this is

105
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,679
not a boom and bust thing it's not like

106
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:12,060
a Snuggie or some new little fun toy

107
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,159
that people are gonna get interested in

108
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,840
and maybe not like in the future we've

109
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,449
already seen in the United States over a

110
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,358
hundred billion dollar illicit black

111
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:22,889
market economy from cannabis so people

112
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,560
have been willing to break the law go to

113
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:27,599
jail here they're everywhere for this

114
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,310
plant and now we have this moment that

115
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,250
this is being legalized on a medical

116
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:34,410
basis around the world now we have a

117
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,329
certain amount of time to establish this

118
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,270
industry with some of the news I'm gonna

119
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:42,779
go over from this last few months we

120
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:45,629
don't have decades to do this like we've

121
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:47,399
been doing this fast fast fast this last

122
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:48,959
three years things have exploded from

123
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,269
the first Tinder's in Germany or

124
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,250
licenses in Denmark or what's happening

125
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:55,589
in Canada and compared to the United

126
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,089
States we didn't have public markets

127
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:58,709
otherwise we would have really scaled

128
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:00,029
and taken that enormous market share

129
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:02,159
that the Canadian public companies are

130
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:03,750
now but when you look at Canada it's

131
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,939
kind of like up north there and really

132
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,529
cold and gray and

133
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:08,120
not the the best place to do

134
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:10,099
agricultural production to supply the

135
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,660
world they had that first mover

136
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,760
advantage and have now been trying to do

137
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,650
acquisitions around the world but what I

138
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,769
see from an investment standpoint I'm a

139
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:20,060
big advocate of private investments I

140
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:21,620
most things that I like for the public

141
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,600
markets are preparing to short them

142
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,129
because I know that the bubble is bigger

143
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,800
than any bubble we've seen in the

144
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:29,420
history of public markets it's 300x

145
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,400
overvalue or like a company doing a

146
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:34,009
million in revenue that's got a market

147
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:36,199
cap of like four billion dollars like

148
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:37,730
that's ridiculous I mean dot-coms this

149
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:40,039
we're gonna get into is like a hundred x

150
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,930
this is like three hundred x so there's

151
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,480
huge opportunities for shorting if you

152
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,370
know what and when to do this when we're

153
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,920
thinking about the world where this is

154
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,389
going it's gonna go very very fast based

155
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,550
on a few laws that are gonna be written

156
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:56,120
into law anywhere from September to

157
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,770
March this year so when we're thinking

158
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,959
about these sorts of companies if you're

159
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:03,349
an investor in normal sectors you know

160
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:04,549
market risk team risk product risk like

161
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,770
the normal things you have to think

162
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,079
about for due diligence now in cannabis

163
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:12,589
you have to remember this is a start-up

164
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:14,509
industry full of startup companies most

165
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:16,819
startups fail because they're not

166
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:18,769
bonafide businesses raising capital is

167
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:20,360
difficult especially if you can't go to

168
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:22,219
the bank and say hey I need a loan to

169
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,930
start this cannabis company if it's

170
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,790
federally illegal where you're trying to

171
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,069
do this you don't have institutional

172
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,020
capital that's going to give you your

173
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:32,959
investment so you need private sources

174
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:34,909
of capital and then we've seen over 200

175
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,009
million dollars u.s. loaned out at

176
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:40,580
eighteen point eight percent on real

177
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:43,430
estate like I pay off buildings in two

178
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:45,620
three four five years like that's not

179
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,329
like normally like a mortgage is until

180
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,250
death so when you're thinking about

181
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:51,399
making eighteen percent on real estate

182
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,360
it's because banks aren't doing loans

183
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:55,759
institutions aren't doing this so like

184
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,050
there's a huge opportunity here not just

185
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,360
for investing into the cannabis

186
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,759
companies touching the plant cultivation

187
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,460
processing distribution dispensaries

188
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,349
extraction manufacturing but the

189
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:08,750
ancillary side of this industry is well

190
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:12,830
like real estate is stable I mean other

191
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:15,168
than 2008-2009 of course kind of kicked

192
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:16,519
off some bad things there from the US so

193
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,288
when I'm looking at these sorts of

194
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,829
markets and like what do I need to do

195
00:07:18,288 --> 00:07:20,479
for Doodle

196
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:22,639
when I'm managing like my personal

197
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,980
capital my investors capital my

198
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,169
number-one rule is like don't lose my

199
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:29,750
investors money like my second rule is

200
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:31,400
like see rule number one so I can't be

201
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,470
risky and just throw it all out there

202
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:35,060
but there's a lot of risk in this space

203
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,040
and there's always risk in start-up

204
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:40,009
industries but the opportunity of

205
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,870
getting large private positions on the

206
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:43,969
cap table like with board control and

207
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,410
seeing these companies scale that's

208
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,630
where there's the biggest impact for

209
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,430
private capital now or you can actually

210
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:51,529
get in for like let's say half a million

211
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:54,079
and get 10% of a company 20% of a

212
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:56,209
company that starts to scale these

213
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:59,149
things like we literally grow money on

214
00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:00,979
trees like that's what our business does

215
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:02,419
so when you're making a cash flow

216
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,950
business and you're investing into that

217
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,319
the proceeds the dividends the

218
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:08,420
distributions are enormous if you have

219
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,219
the right tax structures but a lot of

220
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,620
these companies I'll see a New York

221
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,700
entity or some crazy company that's

222
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,009
doing the investment in some

223
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:17,509
international project so the other risk

224
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:19,579
you have to look at is like where is

225
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:21,649
your money coming from where is it going

226
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:23,959
through like a Holland BV is it going

227
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:25,519
through Luxembourg like and then where

228
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:27,289
is that capital coming back to so you

229
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,039
have to think about the long term exit

230
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,379
strategy

231
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,000
all of our funds are like six eight ten

232
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:34,789
year exits where we just reinvest

233
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,169
reinvest reinvest huge exits come so if

234
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:38,509
you're not preparing for like capital

235
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:40,819
gains taxes or how you're gonna get all

236
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:43,370
of that capital back and not lose 40 50

237
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,330
60 percent of it even if the opportunity

238
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,549
is a great investment

239
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,900
you're gonna lose so much money in the

240
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:49,669
future if you don't plan for these

241
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:51,079
things now those are the risks that as

242
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:52,939
you're looking at these opportunities

243
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,100
it's more than just can they grow good

244
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,440
weed or not that's the easy part this is

245
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,659
agriculture but the normal risks are

246
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,910
much more difficult in cannabis because

247
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:03,500
you've got all this Canadian public news

248
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:05,269
and all this distractions so it's really

249
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,700
hard to see like what's true what's not

250
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:09,319
what's good sources of information

251
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,629
that's where being deep in the industry

252
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,830
being under the hood of hundreds of

253
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:15,379
different companies and knowing what's

254
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:17,210
happening we can see this is good this

255
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:17,899
is not and for investors to go into this

256
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,360
on their own

257
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:22,189
very very very challenging especially

258
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,769
into the public market because 90% of

259
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,180
what you reads not true

260
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:28,730
so kind of in this slide thinking about

261
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:30,169
like that dot-com bubble so many of

262
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,990
these startup companies are gonna fail

263
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,729
and when you're looking for a unicorn

264
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:35,889
like that magical investment that's

265
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,649
gonna have hundreds of X or when you can

266
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:39,909
buy Amazon shares for $2 a share that's

267
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:42,100
when you want to be getting in and

268
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:44,110
playing with these things it's not like

269
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,330
when they're trading at 1500 a share and

270
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,039
that's that's what we try to position

271
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,080
for and you that's why you only have

272
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:51,730
this moment once and there's so much

273
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,400
risk in this industry that if you can

274
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:56,560
know where to put in early this is not

275
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,889
going away it's only a matter of time

276
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:01,959
until like larger legalization happens

277
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:04,120
medically is so important to focus on

278
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,340
internationally recreational is

279
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,450
violating international laws so always

280
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,940
know if you're investing into

281
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:12,190
recreational cannabis be it in Uruguay

282
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:15,190
be it in Canada be it future Mexico

283
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:17,410
recreational your country and company is

284
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,780
violating international law now in the

285
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:22,209
US I'll violate federal law no problem

286
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:23,769
I'll follow state law but never violate

287
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:25,570
international law because you will lose

288
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:28,809
your market share and ability to export

289
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,560
which we'll talk about shortly so one of

290
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:31,089
the things that we notice

291
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:32,739
internationally the same problem here in

292
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:35,710
Germany as we'll get into is that

293
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,120
without demand like an illegal demand

294
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,009
you don't have a market like we're

295
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,200
creating patients and this is a patient

296
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:43,960
focused market but patients come from

297
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,150
doctors writing prescriptions patients

298
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,830
are then your clients clients are your

299
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:50,019
revenue and revenue is your business and

300
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:51,610
without patients you have nothing so

301
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:53,679
there's this huge component now that we

302
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,019
need much more doctor education clinical

303
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:58,149
research clinical trials because so many

304
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:59,829
doctors even here in Germany they're not

305
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:01,209
stoked on writing a prescription for

306
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,009
someone to go home and smoke a plant

307
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:05,290
like everything from their medical

308
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:07,330
practices said like smoking is bad you

309
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:09,309
shouldn't do that so to try to get

310
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:11,410
doctors to understand what are the

311
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:13,929
efficacies with cannabis how to use this

312
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:15,669
properly and a doctor like people think

313
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:18,219
about brands like brands are so

314
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:20,589
important for normal industries yes but

315
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,000
in cannabis it's an API an active

316
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,889
pharmaceutical ingredient so when a

317
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,990
doctor writes a prescription they go

318
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:28,090
into that database they look at that

319
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,909
they put in cannabis if they didn't

320
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:33,550
write a specific brand like viagra or

321
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:35,469
some specific product they're gonna get

322
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:37,269
the generic and in these countries like

323
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:39,490
Germany where they're actually paying

324
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:41,529
for standardized health care the highest

325
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,480
quality standard at the lowest price is

326
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:44,939
the generic for the country we learned

327
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,250
that in the first round of the German

328
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,900
process it's not about brands it's about

329
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,669
the highest quality standards at the

330
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:52,110
lowest price of production but if we

331
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,610
don't create the demand which there's

332
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,889
the demand from the consumers and the

333
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:58,470
patients but legal access and the

334
00:11:55,889 --> 00:12:00,149
gatekeepers are the doctors so if you're

335
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,220
in a country or if you're in a program

336
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:03,809
you have to work towards doctoral

337
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,580
education as part of your investment

338
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:07,019
thesis otherwise you're not going to

339
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,830
have clients to actually fund that

340
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:12,449
business so you know I think about like

341
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,160
planning I'm like when to enter a market

342
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:16,350
like what's important for a business

343
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,600
like the team the market the product

344
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,300
what's unique is it protected is it

345
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,250
differentiated do these people for me

346
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:24,839
it's not important for a project or for

347
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,940
an investment if they even know anything

348
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,980
about cannabis at all this is an

349
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,570
agricultural commodity this is

350
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,840
manufacturing pharmaceutical processing

351
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:36,390
and this is retail or distribution so if

352
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,030
you think about that first it's not that

353
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:41,069
special it's amazing medicinal plant but

354
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:42,569
it's still a plant and agriculture has

355
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,490
been around for 10,000 years

356
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,530
so any of these new big gimmicks you

357
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:48,720
might invest into from like cultivation

358
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:50,459
companies or fertilizer companies that

359
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,950
are gonna quadruple your yield it's like

360
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,150
you got to look into that because

361
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:57,120
traditional agriculture we weren't

362
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,990
growing corn and warehouses like it just

363
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,419
doesn't make sense

364
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:03,210
so trying to have like a six hectare

365
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:04,860
indoor facility that's GMP that's great

366
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:07,110
but your cost of production is gonna be

367
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,899
so high your competitive advantage is

368
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,550
gone so the only time like planning or a

369
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:13,769
big indoor works as if it's part of a

370
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:15,269
vertical market or for like research and

371
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:18,090
development but really for seasoned

372
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:20,309
hybrid GMP greenhouses are the best and

373
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,780
you can like ride in and catch a big

374
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:23,309
wave a big investment but if there's

375
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:25,529
like people around you that knock it off

376
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:26,819
or if all of a sudden your program no

377
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:29,429
longer can do what you think you're

378
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,690
gonna do your business is done so the

379
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:31,889
planning is more important for these

380
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,540
teams so if you're looking at an

381
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:35,879
investment look at the team do they know

382
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:37,740
what they're doing from outside industry

383
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:40,019
do they come from finance from

384
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,149
manufacturing from processing is there

385
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:44,309
anything unique there at all or they

386
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:45,959
just master growers because like master

387
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:47,489
growers are not master businesspeople

388
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,440
and like our joke in the US is like

389
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:51,000
their master fuck-ups but it's more

390
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,070
because they're the biggest problem with

391
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,570
all of our industry because they started

392
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,760
a cultivation knowing what they did in

393
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,660
their basement or their closet and then

394
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,159
they're trying to do that on a

395
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:00,799
commercial

396
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:02,539
scale and they have no idea so look for

397
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,578
people with agricultural experience or

398
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:05,838
pharmaceutical experience not just

399
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:09,500
people that know how to make good hash

400
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,720
like that's the easy part so a couple of

401
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,190
things that really from my investment

402
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,259
thesis internationally for our private

403
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,870
equity and venture capital you got to

404
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:18,889
know the rules to play the game and

405
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:21,078
everyone's just looking at this industry

406
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:22,970
and it's so exciting but they don't know

407
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:25,219
what rules govern them like you always

408
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,540
have to know what you have to serve so

409
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,149
like the w-h-o and the reclassification

410
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:30,588
this is enormous some of these things

411
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:32,000
that's happened the last three to six

412
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:34,040
months have changed the entire

413
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,919
international landscape of what's legal

414
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:38,990
what's not where to produce and where to

415
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:40,639
avoid even though there's some countries

416
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:43,188
like we'll get into with like Cyprus and

417
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,659
Malta and Greece and like countries in

418
00:14:43,188 --> 00:14:48,528
Central and South America or your

419
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:50,509
amazing tie-in with like the Zimbabwe

420
00:14:48,528 --> 00:14:52,879
President or something like just because

421
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:55,100
it sounds unique if it's not following

422
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,659
some of these laws it's not going to

423
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,220
happen you're going to lose your money

424
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:59,600
and you're gonna think of how great it

425
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,310
would have been and then you're gonna

426
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,680
regret and that's the one thing with

427
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:05,328
this time delta you only have so much

428
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,758
time to get your money into the markets

429
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:09,049
and private markets because public

430
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,649
everyone's gonna trade in the future

431
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:14,059
once this is institutionalized Amazon's

432
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:15,438
fifteen hundred bucks a share you're

433
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:17,388
just trading like everyone else you're

434
00:15:15,438 --> 00:15:18,889
shorting the Hong Kong dollar the

435
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:21,318
companies that won't come in now that's

436
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:22,818
where you see opportunity now to get

437
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:24,438
your capital in and every day like I

438
00:15:22,818 --> 00:15:26,838
don't have investors capital their money

439
00:15:24,438 --> 00:15:28,278
is less valuable to me because that time

440
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:29,660
is so important especially with some of

441
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:32,929
these single conventions like the single

442
00:15:29,659 --> 00:15:36,730
convention of 1961 is your Bible

443
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:39,799
currently if you're in global cannabis

444
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:41,120
essentially with the CMD coming out as

445
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:42,919
well of like pushing for like the

446
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,688
rescheduling we were hoping they were

447
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:46,159
gonna vote on this like we were with the

448
00:15:44,688 --> 00:15:48,259
UN and the end of the year and not in

449
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,879
Vienna we were hoping this was going to

450
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:51,919
come through like for the rescheduling

451
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:53,688
and they pretty much requiring that

452
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:56,058
countries of the single convention would

453
00:15:53,688 --> 00:15:57,379
be providing these products that's a

454
00:15:56,058 --> 00:15:59,419
hundred and sixty eight different

455
00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:02,629
countries that once this vote goes

456
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:04,729
through and is enacted must provide

457
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:06,889
those products to patients in their

458
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,688
country so I don't care if they want to

459
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:11,029
legalize cannabis or not or produce it

460
00:16:08,688 --> 00:16:13,099
or not they have to provide

461
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:14,990
insulin to people with diabetic like

462
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,580
with diabetes that's pretty much like

463
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,529
what some of this would mean so that's

464
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:20,570
why we have like three to 12 months to

465
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:23,689
really position companies to be global

466
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:26,660
producers not Canada not just Israel not

467
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:28,250
just Holland not just Denmark but the

468
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:30,079
highest quality lowest cost of

469
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,850
production countries that are legal

470
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,560
currently or enacting laws the ones that

471
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,659
are gonna wait two three years by that

472
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:39,319
time it's too late for what we're doing

473
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:40,879
internationally the incb like

474
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,320
International Narcotics Control Board

475
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:44,929
like that's when we start thinking about

476
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,030
like Interpol and like adult things like

477
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:48,529
don't violate international law it's

478
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:50,569
really really bad for business and

479
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:53,899
really bad for your freedom if you want

480
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:56,360
to stay a free person their report about

481
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:58,009
two three weeks ago the 2018 report was

482
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,050
pretty much who's on the naughty list

483
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:01,610
who's on the nice list like kind of like

484
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:03,769
a Santa Claus and which programs are

485
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,269
bona fide and real and which programs

486
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:07,670
are illegal and violating international

487
00:17:05,269 --> 00:17:09,529
law and just because there's a country

488
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,150
that makes a program if it's not

489
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:13,339
compliant with the international law

490
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:15,290
they won't be able to export their

491
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:16,669
products some of the problems that many

492
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:19,279
Colombians are going to face many

493
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,720
Israelis are going to face so many of

494
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,149
these countries are producing under the

495
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,529
local requirements of that program but

496
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,930
not knowing how they have to be

497
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:29,629
compliant internationally and for me for

498
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:31,190
where I invest I always think how do I

499
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,720
produce at the highest standards of the

500
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,250
country I have to produce at but what's

501
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,559
the hardest country in the world to

502
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:39,200
import to and I want to produce it their

503
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,460
standards so Canada started with GPP

504
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,650
they don't like they didn't even know

505
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,410
what GMP was at first and with the

506
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:46,610
European Union European GMP is kind of

507
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:48,529
important you can't just say you're

508
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:50,629
certified and processed but when the

509
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:52,639
incb is coming out and sending warning

510
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,770
letters to country saying you're

511
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,390
breaking the law like that's kind of a

512
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:57,920
big deal it's like a warning letter of

513
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:00,230
like we're going to raid you we're going

514
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,480
to shut this down if you invest into one

515
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,339
of those countries and that happens your

516
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,529
investments done market risk your market

517
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:09,109
just went away you were making tires and

518
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:10,549
tires are now illegal like that's the

519
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:13,579
position you do not want to be with one

520
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:15,230
of your investments so let's think about

521
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:16,609
like camp here because there's cannabis

522
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,019
you know there's hemp everyone's kind of

523
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:20,359
confused what's the differentiation

524
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:23,180
they're all dogs and like the joke is

525
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:24,979
like cannabis is like a poodle and hemp

526
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,230
is like a Great Dane they're both

527
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,880
dogs they're both from wolves and humans

528
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,620
through us breeding them like Gregor

529
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,630
Mendel like with pea pods back here in

530
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:34,939
Germany a long time ago that's how we

531
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,740
made different types of cannabis but

532
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,930
cannabis sativa it's the same species

533
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,819
and the biological definition of a

534
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:42,830
species is the ability to make sexually

535
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:44,240
viable offspring so I could take the

536
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:46,339
biggest hemp plant with the smallest

537
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,930
highest THC cannabis plant it's gonna be

538
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:49,399
somewhere in the middle but like don't

539
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,990
take a bull dog and mix it with a shih

540
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,820
tzu and get some is kind of

541
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:55,039
like the example there but that point

542
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:56,779
three percent point four percent for THC

543
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:00,259
is really what's the difference between

544
00:18:56,779 --> 00:19:02,389
hemp and cannabis and hemp and CBD huge

545
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:04,129
opportunities in it especially in Europe

546
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:06,070
but in the United States in many of

547
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:08,450
these countries it's completely illegal

548
00:19:06,069 --> 00:19:10,939
CBD in the United States is the same

549
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:12,680
scheduling as heroin so like people are

550
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,720
like it's legal in 50 states it's like

551
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,850
pretty much like heroin or narcotics

552
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,650
like the same schedule one so if you get

553
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:20,659
into that also know the rules to play

554
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:22,310
that game because if it's not legal you

555
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,480
can't do it but like with Austria with

556
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:26,359
Switzerland with some of these hemp

557
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,549
programs coming amazing novel foods

558
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:30,379
opportunities for CBD companies but if

559
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:31,819
it's just a CBD company and doesn't have

560
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,890
novel foods doesn't have some of those

561
00:19:31,819 --> 00:19:36,200
registrations it's not gonna take

562
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:38,120
international market share and Rite Aid

563
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,350
or Walgreens or big pharmaceutical

564
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:40,699
companies are not going to buy your

565
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:44,179
products like you might think for your

566
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:46,519
revenue in the United States we have the

567
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:48,289
farm bill in 2014 which started the

568
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:51,049
legalization of cannabis like for hemp

569
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:53,240
the 2018 farm bill started and really

570
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:56,240
made things legal but the United States

571
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,250
will not be global hemp producers at

572
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,109
least as of now we don't have the

573
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:02,390
infrastructure research and development

574
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:03,679
the genetics like we're doing so much

575
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,210
breeding we're getting better and better

576
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,150
you look at Charlotte's Web like Stanley

577
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,980
Brothers 21 million last quarter like

578
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,660
that's coming up and that was just from

579
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,309
a small company in Colorado where we

580
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,670
were one of the first big hemp producers

581
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:18,649
but when you're thinking about the FDA

582
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:20,330
epitaxy of xgw pharmaceutical that that

583
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:22,580
company was approved by the FDA as a

584
00:20:20,329 --> 00:20:24,589
cannabinoid and really set a precedent

585
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:26,720
for CBD from a pharmaceutical standpoint

586
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:28,069
so we have any time you hear CBD it's

587
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,200
kind of like a buzz word it's a snake

588
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:31,759
oil industry right now that 95% of the

589
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,519
products don't even have it in it which

590
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:36,559
is like selling bottles of like a few

591
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:37,789
ounces for $300 to someone with cancer

592
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,730
saying it's going to cure their cancer

593
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:40,558
but it's like

594
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,269
hemp seed oil so you have to be very

595
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:44,730
careful when you're investing in CBD to

596
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:46,829
know it's legal and it's real because

597
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:49,019
there's so many CBD products cat food

598
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:51,480
products like Water Products CBD shampoo

599
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:53,250
like all sounds great yeah the

600
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,140
veterinary side the cosmetics side that

601
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,849
sounds great but it's got to be legal

602
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,970
and it's got to be real and if it's not

603
00:20:56,849 --> 00:21:00,689
you have to be able to avoid it

604
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,850
this is kind of like my favorite

605
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,169
metaphor I always kind of mention I just

606
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:06,928
remember the late nights as a kid

607
00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:07,950
playing this little game risk you may

608
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:10,559
have seen it here it's like world

609
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:12,120
domination you know maybe not the best

610
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:15,869
kind of example to mention in Germany

611
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:20,519
here or in the United States it's

612
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:22,409
horrible but you got one shot like we

613
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:24,119
just opened up the box the board's down

614
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,798
all your homies you're all sitting

615
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:27,899
around the game and it's like where are

616
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:29,279
you gonna put your pieces like where are

617
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,809
you gonna put your investments I don't

618
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,609
have hundreds of billions I can just

619
00:21:30,808 --> 00:21:34,139
take over everything right now with a

620
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:35,699
billion of additional capital I probably

621
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,400
own twenty plus percent of the sector

622
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,660
for life now if constellation had given

623
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,160
that to us we would have pretty much

624
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:44,009
been the only private thing in the world

625
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,660
but you know long-term so you're

626
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:47,190
choosing where to put these pieces where

627
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,080
are you gonna double down where are you

628
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:50,730
gonna go to war and like fight for that

629
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:53,069
territory for that country for that

630
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:55,110
company because it's only happening once

631
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:56,730
and if you come in with like one little

632
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:58,199
person on a country and you keep putting

633
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,298
more there if you're in the wrong

634
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,190
country you lose everything

635
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:04,079
so some sectors are good and some are

636
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,640
bad so that's gonna kind of transition

637
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:07,168
into like talking about which countries

638
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,530
and markets now I really think are the

639
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:12,360
most important so II use awesome I love

640
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,678
the European Union some of the countries

641
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:15,209
here in Europe that are not a part of

642
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,559
the European Union trying to get into

643
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,720
this program we're going to have major

644
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:19,649
problems just because I mentioned this

645
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,150
morning like just because you're

646
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:22,620
producing in Macedonians sell it

647
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:24,960
illegally to someone in Poland in the

648
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:28,379
who then can sell it to Germany doesn't

649
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,000
mean it's legal so just because you can

650
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,559
do something doesn't mean it's legal and

651
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,690
that you should do it and just because

652
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,889
others are doing something also doesn't

653
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,660
mean that you should be doing it

654
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,220
sometimes they're going towards a cliff

655
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,630
and you're just hooking right on to them

656
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,419
and then you're gonna get involved in

657
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:43,620
litigation is on the skyrocketing up and

658
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:44,850
up so you have to be able to protect

659
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:47,369
yourself but when we're thinking about

660
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:49,469
the EU it's huge here but it's gonna be

661
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:51,418
much slower than people think because

662
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,380
things go through process apparently you

663
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:54,120
like papers here

664
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,070
in the United States I could do digital

665
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:58,019
and get a driver's license here it's

666
00:22:56,069 --> 00:23:02,189
like paper or paperwork paperwork the

667
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:03,720
bee farm so much slower but it's so big

668
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:07,440
here if you position yourselves

669
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,839
correctly with one of the pieces with

670
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,600
with monitoring of like these drug

671
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,308
programs they're starting the precedent

672
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,990
that what I see Germany and European

673
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:18,660
Union countries doing will essentially

674
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:20,160
emulate across the globe many countries

675
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,660
are going to be watching these countries

676
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,250
in here to see what they're allowing

677
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,019
because you've been doing things so much

678
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:27,298
longer from a regulated basis and

679
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:29,490
copying those it's not going to be

680
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:31,440
Chinese hemp companies selling CBD to

681
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:33,779
like European countries it's like I

682
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,269
really see like a European economy here

683
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:37,710
but also knowing that with the EU like

684
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:39,720
Germany couldn't say hey we're not gonna

685
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:41,220
allow imports from Portugal or from

686
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,779
somewhere else in the EU it's like if it

687
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:45,000
meets those quality standards you've got

688
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:47,129
that free trade here which is really an

689
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,690
interesting opportunity if you know

690
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,250
which laws you're following so when

691
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:53,308
you're scheduling and registering drug

692
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:54,808
products ACMs api's once you're

693
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:56,700
registering in one country and re

694
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:58,558
registering that in other countries in

695
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,600
part of an API database you're

696
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,819
essentially the Pfizer for cannabis

697
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:03,678
already even ask private companies early

698
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:07,200
on

699
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,880
so in reclassifying CBD this is also

700
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,220
like very important I mentioned novel

701
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,809
foods before it if you don't have novel

702
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,150
foods or understand what that is and you

703
00:24:12,808 --> 00:24:17,158
want to be a global CVD player you're

704
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:18,450
wrong and your company's not going to be

705
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:19,679
able to sell the products that you think

706
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,659
and that's gonna be very expensive

707
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,788
you're gonna need contract manufacturers

708
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:26,070
it's a much more lengthy process than

709
00:24:23,788 --> 00:24:27,329
growing some weeds sucking some oils out

710
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:29,189
of them putting them in a pretty bottle

711
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:31,918
in a pretty box and then just selling it

712
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:34,620
online people are doing that doesn't

713
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,940
mean it's legal but novelty foods is

714
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:38,158
something that if you're making edibles

715
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:41,548
products oils manufactured nasal sprays

716
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:43,470
sublinguals pills anything from CBD it

717
00:24:41,548 --> 00:24:45,269
must be under those programs for the

718
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:47,490
future so forward-thinking compliance

719
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:49,048
don't just be compliant now what's the

720
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,429
forward regulations you're gonna have to

721
00:24:49,048 --> 00:24:52,019
be compliant with with an investment

722
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:53,519
otherwise you're doing it you're

723
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:55,470
investing you're starting all these jobs

724
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,679
and then you can't sell anything and

725
00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:00,329
that's not a good business model Germany

726
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:02,220
I love it like the first tinder process

727
00:25:00,329 --> 00:25:04,918
like having a qualification there those

728
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,269
first ten having those taken away the

729
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,619
only value that came to me

730
00:25:06,269 --> 00:25:09,628
from all of that struggle in Germany

731
00:25:07,618 --> 00:25:11,338
years ago was learning all they care

732
00:25:09,628 --> 00:25:13,708
about his quality and the lowest price

733
00:25:11,338 --> 00:25:15,989
that's it like I have the ability of

734
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:18,450
saving government's billions of dollars

735
00:25:15,989 --> 00:25:20,038
by producing in low-cost countries at

736
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,200
the highest standards they require an

737
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:23,908
importing to those markets not every

738
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,149
country needs to grow pineapples in

739
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:28,679
warehouses to have pineapples like we

740
00:25:27,148 --> 00:25:30,088
grow strawberries in some places we

741
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:31,950
shipped them other places we grow

742
00:25:30,088 --> 00:25:34,048
blueberries we grow flowers in Colombia

743
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:35,609
which is indicative of like flowers grow

744
00:25:34,048 --> 00:25:37,769
there well but it doesn't necessarily

745
00:25:35,608 --> 00:25:38,968
mean if their standards are not correct

746
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:40,888
that they're gonna be able to send to

747
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:44,788
those markets so when you're thinking

748
00:25:40,888 --> 00:25:46,648
about what Germany wants GA cpg ap GMP

749
00:25:44,788 --> 00:25:48,538
perfect that means if I'm in Colombia

750
00:25:46,648 --> 00:25:50,428
I'd better be doing those if I'm in

751
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:53,249
Canada I'd better be doing those because

752
00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:55,859
that fake GPP will no longer work in the

753
00:25:53,249 --> 00:25:57,959
future this is the problem though here

754
00:25:55,858 --> 00:26:00,449
we've got 80 plus million people in

755
00:25:57,959 --> 00:26:02,099
Germany but the doctors are not making

756
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:04,409
prescriptions like we would like them to

757
00:26:02,098 --> 00:26:07,259
because you've had to try everything and

758
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:08,729
then you can try cannabis what I love

759
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:10,709
are programs that say anything your

760
00:26:08,729 --> 00:26:13,469
doctor thinks cannabis can help you with

761
00:26:10,709 --> 00:26:14,999
you can then make a prescription for it

762
00:26:13,469 --> 00:26:17,399
not like you've tried every single other

763
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:18,778
drug product and now everything's

764
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:21,628
failing this person's dying

765
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:22,979
okay let's try cannabis that's really

766
00:26:21,628 --> 00:26:25,319
really hard to make a program but not

767
00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:26,848
even a hundred million and Germany has

768
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:28,558
really been hard because people said it

769
00:26:26,848 --> 00:26:30,778
is that benchmark internationally of the

770
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:32,219
market they want hundreds of millions of

771
00:26:30,778 --> 00:26:34,019
dollars have been spent on trying to win

772
00:26:32,219 --> 00:26:36,179
these tenders or the second round tinder

773
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:37,828
but you'll notice I didn't apply for one

774
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:39,629
of the last tenders and I I mean we got

775
00:26:37,828 --> 00:26:41,249
two of the first Danish licenses we've

776
00:26:39,628 --> 00:26:42,988
gotten licenses all over the country I

777
00:26:41,249 --> 00:26:46,048
don't even want that here I just want

778
00:26:42,989 --> 00:26:47,459
important distribution that's it because

779
00:26:46,048 --> 00:26:49,528
I know that the cost of production here

780
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:52,078
is gonna be so much higher than anywhere

781
00:26:49,528 --> 00:26:53,700
else in the EU down farther south your

782
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:56,308
regulations your tax your compliance

783
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,169
your VAT it's just like hey let's start

784
00:26:56,308 --> 00:26:59,519
some companies or CBD companies or

785
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:01,079
cannabis companies in France

786
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:02,608
you'd be like it's me very very

787
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:03,868
expensive to operate but if we can just

788
00:27:02,608 --> 00:27:05,999
grow it somewhere else at those

789
00:27:03,868 --> 00:27:09,028
standards and import it that's what I

790
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:11,308
want to be doing you know so it's been

791
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:13,709
years it's been happening these are the

792
00:27:11,308 --> 00:27:15,598
main challenges the doctor education the

793
00:27:13,709 --> 00:27:17,219
right perception of cannabis but even

794
00:27:15,598 --> 00:27:18,838
though it's slow right now just think

795
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:20,130
about what you're doing now indicative

796
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:22,200
for five years

797
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:24,539
for ten years that's that's that's the

798
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,210
timeline I look at like every dollar I

799
00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:28,919
put in I don't care about it for five

800
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:31,710
ten years but I'm just hoping that

801
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:34,320
that's gonna turn into $100 or $200 or

802
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:36,538
$300 the longer you keep your money in

803
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,000
these markets the better it will do for

804
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:40,558
you now if it's public companies you're

805
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,359
just giving it to a bunch of Yahoo's to

806
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,220
reinvest buy things and sell things

807
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:46,319
based on what they're speculating they

808
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:48,089
can do and sometimes they can but a lot

809
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:49,769
of them they new capital and how to

810
00:27:48,089 --> 00:27:51,928
manipulate public markets they did not

811
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:53,369
know cannabis and that's why you see

812
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:54,960
canopy and tilray

813
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:58,019
and aurora making all of these major

814
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,250
acquisitions and sometimes garbage like

815
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:03,480
I'm like you spent three hundred and

816
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:04,529
thirty million dollars on that it's

817
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,940
gonna be a little bit smarter if you're

818
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:07,740
a multi-billion dollar company but

819
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,929
startup industries startup public

820
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,538
companies so Canada I'm from northern

821
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:14,309
Wisconsin as a kid Canada I appreciate

822
00:28:12,538 --> 00:28:16,169
what they did in starting the first

823
00:28:14,308 --> 00:28:17,970
federal or a kind of medical program

824
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:19,890
like that I mean other than Uruguay and

825
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:21,419
recreational all adults should have

826
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,850
access to cannabis that they wanted or

827
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:25,259
not like just like alcohol or something

828
00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:27,119
else we're seeing alcohol sales have

829
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:29,329
gone down thirteen percent legal states

830
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:32,369
and countries like where this access is

831
00:28:29,329 --> 00:28:34,319
but can it unfortunately like they knew

832
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:36,359
there's only 40 million people here they

833
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:38,069
have a very robust illicit market they

834
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:40,408
started doing acquisitions all over the

835
00:28:38,069 --> 00:28:42,808
world and into the United States the

836
00:28:40,409 --> 00:28:44,159
problem though with Canada is that

837
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:46,019
you've got all these startup companies

838
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,750
listing on public markets that have

839
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:50,970
nothing there reverse splits reverse

840
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:52,380
mergers all of this garbage and they're

841
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:54,058
acting like they own the world but then

842
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,250
many of those companies are illegal in

843
00:28:54,058 --> 00:28:59,250
their filings or in their processes or

844
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:01,019
they're investing into us and anytime

845
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,460
you have a multinational or a foreign

846
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:04,589
national investing into something that's

847
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,759
federally illegal that's not good that'd

848
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:08,369
be like hey let's take some money from

849
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:10,519
Germany and go down to like is Becca

850
00:29:08,369 --> 00:29:12,808
stand and start a giant heroin operation

851
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:14,879
like that's gonna work out really good

852
00:29:12,808 --> 00:29:16,710
like not the best but they've been

853
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,230
getting away with it but as soon as the

854
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:21,200
CSE and the TSX start D listing some of

855
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:24,089
these stocks if you invested into them

856
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,009
your money is not in a good place so you

857
00:29:24,089 --> 00:29:28,019
have to be very careful with what you're

858
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:30,089
doing ETFs are good for like giving

859
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:31,679
capital like private funds and ETFs like

860
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:32,808
to get your money in and have people who

861
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,820
know the mark

862
00:29:32,808 --> 00:29:37,278
to put it in but the problem even with

863
00:29:34,819 --> 00:29:38,689
like some of those exchanges is that if

864
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:40,460
you're investing into good companies

865
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:42,350
they're tied in with the bad companies

866
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:44,329
so then as soon as that market starts to

867
00:29:42,349 --> 00:29:45,469
shift or the bubble bursts even your

868
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:46,220
good companies are going to be going

869
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:48,558
down as well

870
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:50,720
that's why private investments long-term

871
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:54,019
investments are the best places for your

872
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,700
capital currently I kind of like this

873
00:29:54,019 --> 00:29:57,950
like one-story listed there publicly

874
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,480
like I like them bringing access to the

875
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,980
world but it's like Silicon Valley right

876
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,690
now and just because everyone's talking

877
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,610
about these companies doesn't mean that

878
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:05,929
what they're doing is right the amount

879
00:30:04,609 --> 00:30:08,599
of companies I see trying to piggyback

880
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:10,519
and copy these companies over and over

881
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:12,439
again it's not the goal to try to be

882
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:14,118
them what are they missing what are they

883
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,340
not doing what are they doing wrong and

884
00:30:14,118 --> 00:30:18,499
how do you hedge your bets to position

885
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:20,148
for when they fail like you're up side

886
00:30:18,499 --> 00:30:21,829
comes like our hedge fund and Macau

887
00:30:20,148 --> 00:30:23,748
should be launched in live by like the

888
00:30:21,829 --> 00:30:25,460
third third quarter of this year all

889
00:30:23,749 --> 00:30:27,110
we're gonna be doing is just watching

890
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:29,179
their markets and knowing when to short

891
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:31,329
but I also know that like 90% of those

892
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:33,679
press releases you see are pure garbage

893
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:35,058
pure lies but no one knows it and then

894
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,369
it's hard to find access to information

895
00:30:35,058 --> 00:30:39,259
but I do appreciate any company that's

896
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:41,599
trying to Bank bring medical cannabis to

897
00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:43,700
suffering patients but not just at their

898
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,740
detriment or for their profit people

899
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:48,440
planet profit like that's true profit

900
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:50,298
not just trying to sell somebody a drug

901
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,429
that's gonna keep them alive for longer

902
00:30:50,298 --> 00:30:54,888
but cost them $600 a day like some of

903
00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:56,659
these other medications we see but long

904
00:30:54,888 --> 00:30:58,398
term Pharma will take this but medical

905
00:30:56,659 --> 00:31:01,999
and recreational cannabis is we know it

906
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:03,768
is one thing Pharma is very different

907
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:04,970
and that's like epitaxy davecs that's

908
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:08,028
where we're going you have to look at

909
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:09,589
both sectors and be in both but this is

910
00:31:08,028 --> 00:31:11,329
the problem you cannot take money from

911
00:31:09,589 --> 00:31:13,609
Canada invest into things that are

912
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:15,678
illegal federally in the United States

913
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:18,288
or kind of like the bee farms been

914
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,059
talking or a few other countries if you

915
00:31:18,288 --> 00:31:21,710
have a license and you're a public

916
00:31:20,058 --> 00:31:24,230
company or a private company and you're

917
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:27,528
profiting from recreational cannabis and

918
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:29,868
medical cannabis no longer being able to

919
00:31:27,528 --> 00:31:32,118
act like to send medical cannabis to

920
00:31:29,868 --> 00:31:33,798
medical countries so what would that do

921
00:31:32,118 --> 00:31:35,658
to tell rates stock price to canopy

922
00:31:33,798 --> 00:31:37,849
stock price to aurora's stock price if

923
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:39,440
they no longer can be importing to all

924
00:31:37,849 --> 00:31:41,089
these other countries and then

925
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,308
everyone's growing a ton of

926
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:45,709
marijuana in Canada that now they can't

927
00:31:43,308 --> 00:31:46,339
sell anywhere else and the price is

928
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,990
already like the

929
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:50,240
almost a thousand pending licenses

930
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:52,190
they're growing so much cannabis in

931
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,569
Canada and keep lying saying they have

932
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:56,090
all these shortages to keep getting more

933
00:31:53,569 --> 00:31:57,589
investment into it but once that is all

934
00:31:56,089 --> 00:31:59,449
getting established and there's so much

935
00:31:57,589 --> 00:32:02,599
cannabis legal medical and recreational

936
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:04,429
and 80 plus percent of them can't send

937
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:06,408
it to the rest of the world it's just

938
00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:09,169
gonna be like an ocean of water and they

939
00:32:06,409 --> 00:32:10,460
Chiefs keep filling it with water so

940
00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:12,528
like the prices are going to plummet

941
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,028
those companies are going to like tank

942
00:32:12,528 --> 00:32:15,470
many of them go out of business and I

943
00:32:14,028 --> 00:32:17,058
hope with our private equity to come in

944
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:18,169
and buy many of those distressed assets

945
00:32:17,058 --> 00:32:20,028
and spread them around the world

946
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:21,500
but you're gonna see the greatest stock

947
00:32:20,028 --> 00:32:24,079
market crashes bigger than anything

948
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:26,720
you've ever seen from Wall Street or any

949
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:28,158
past big bubble crashes in Canada and

950
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,960
it's gonna be so detrimental for their

951
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,130
entire economy but if a couple of those

952
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,929
big are gonna still be

953
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:35,510
billionaires and happy from having

954
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:37,000
manipulated the markets so be very

955
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:39,528
careful with some of those companies I

956
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,450
won two of the first eleven licenses in

957
00:32:39,528 --> 00:32:43,190
Denmark we sold one still have another I

958
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:44,870
don't care about growing in Denmark it's

959
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:47,028
called a they're they work 32 hours

960
00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:50,629
a week other than like one month in the

961
00:32:47,028 --> 00:32:52,038
summer like I don't know man like so

962
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,600
Denmark the cost of reductions hi

963
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:56,140
everyone also thinks it's this huge

964
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:58,428
program it's a pilot research program

965
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,809
like the government last a couple weeks

966
00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:01,429
ago like the Danish medicines agency

967
00:32:59,808 --> 00:33:02,720
where's all these research plans we were

968
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:04,340
supposed to see you're all just

969
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,470
Canadians bringing hundreds of millions

970
00:33:04,339 --> 00:33:08,629
of dollars to build greenhouses here but

971
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:10,038
like it's a pilot research program yeah

972
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,429
they've got the highest cancer rate per

973
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:12,109
capita

974
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:13,700
yeah cannabis is gonna be great for them

975
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:15,709
but it's not the country to take over

976
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,720
the world with it was just the second

977
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:19,220
country other than Canada that was going

978
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,750
to allow international export that's why

979
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,370
we went there but I'm not there I

980
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,929
haven't put in an additional dollar in I

981
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:25,788
just made five mill selling a piece of

982
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:27,440
paper it's like so you have to know

983
00:33:25,788 --> 00:33:29,619
which markets and when but like where to

984
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:33,019
double down once you get a license

985
00:33:29,619 --> 00:33:35,569
grease Mike Macedonia Cyprus Macedonia

986
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:36,859
actually has it a very decent program

987
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:39,230
that just needs to be changed a little

988
00:33:36,859 --> 00:33:40,699
bit and could be very advantageous for

989
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,380
the world and for some other countries

990
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,000
but when you look at some of these like

991
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,230
Cyprus Malta like that's where you do

992
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,089
money laundering it's not where you grow

993
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:50,599
cannabis or wait they they close that

994
00:33:47,089 --> 00:33:51,528
down in like 2009 2012 those are not the

995
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:53,509
countries that are going to take over

996
00:33:51,528 --> 00:33:54,798
the world for production there's some

997
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:56,690
advantages there and there's some

998
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:58,038
patients there that need cannabis but

999
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:59,720
just because there's someone who wants a

1000
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:01,009
pineapple somewhere it doesn't need

1001
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,960
mean I need to start a pineapple

1002
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:04,519
plantation so when I look at these

1003
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,360
countries especially with Greece there's

1004
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:07,038
opportunity there

1005
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:09,049
tikkun olam and a few got some of those

1006
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:10,759
first licenses really exciting but some

1007
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:13,220
of the laws they copied from Israel

1008
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,780
could make their program very very

1009
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:17,209
challenging to do business in the future

1010
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:20,269
and it's Greece but it's a member of the

1011
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:21,559
EU so it could be a player if it doesn't

1012
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:22,358
turn out to be corrupt or have some of

1013
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,858
those problems

1014
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:27,049
you know Spain we were there for ICBC a

1015
00:34:24,858 --> 00:34:28,848
couple weeks ago Spain kind of a

1016
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:30,919
show of a program as well unfortunately

1017
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:33,169
it's like similar to like tolerated

1018
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:35,269
coffeehouse kind of clubs but they're

1019
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:37,009
still years away from a bonafide program

1020
00:34:35,269 --> 00:34:38,329
now there's a lot of capital in Spain

1021
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,070
that wants to get into the market but

1022
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:42,139
it's not about the domestic market in

1023
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:44,330
Spain but long-term like they know

1024
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:45,679
cannabis there but their program has so

1025
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:47,210
many problems just like the Netherlands

1026
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,769
like they're gonna give twenty

1027
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,628
coffeehouse licenses to start actually

1028
00:34:48,769 --> 00:34:51,980
growing cannabis and not like importing

1029
00:34:50,628 --> 00:34:53,750
hash in your butt to sell on a coffee

1030
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:56,030
house they're like the current program

1031
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:58,429
it's like tolerated but it's not like

1032
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:59,750
legal they're gonna legalize that and

1033
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,309
it's gonna be a probably a billion two

1034
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,719
billion dollar market there but Spain

1035
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:04,699
it's gonna be a little bit slower

1036
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:05,929
you know Portugal is one of the

1037
00:35:04,699 --> 00:35:07,759
countries a lot of people are talking

1038
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:09,199
about until rates making a lot of weird

1039
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,030
claims right now about all of their

1040
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:13,159
amazing GMP greenhouses which if you've

1041
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:14,780
seen them roll up plastic science does

1042
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:16,969
not mean GMP and if you don't know what

1043
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,950
GMP is and your international you'd

1044
00:35:16,969 --> 00:35:21,379
better research it like for how you trim

1045
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:23,659
dry crossest your package manufacturer

1046
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:26,059
it's not just saying your GMP like it's

1047
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:27,379
great to be like we're GMP GSEP like you

1048
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:29,539
have to know what those things are and

1049
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:31,910
it's not cannabis that's certified GMP

1050
00:35:29,539 --> 00:35:33,500
it's your processes your facilities so

1051
00:35:31,909 --> 00:35:35,769
in many countries we've just been buying

1052
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,849
GMP facilities from other industries

1053
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:39,588
repurposing those to easily get our

1054
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:41,059
certifications that's how I've beaten

1055
00:35:39,588 --> 00:35:42,289
some of these public companies by nine

1056
00:35:41,059 --> 00:35:44,739
to twelve months in some of these

1057
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:47,329
markets so just remember like Portugal

1058
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:48,709
you know there are two licenses there

1059
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:50,329
was a third issued a couple weeks ago

1060
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:51,650
for some outdoor production just because

1061
00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:53,329
Aurora says that they're going to be

1062
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:55,338
buying some country on in the Azores

1063
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:56,690
that's gonna produce one ton a year that

1064
00:35:55,338 --> 00:35:58,608
they're applying for they don't have a

1065
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:00,619
license and to see their stock price

1066
00:35:58,608 --> 00:36:03,409
what that's done Portugal will be like

1067
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:05,900
the lowest cost highest quality

1068
00:36:03,409 --> 00:36:07,549
production but it's so challenging to

1069
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,380
get in that most people don't understand

1070
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:11,300
like what's going on there how it's

1071
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:13,730
going to work but for their population I

1072
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:15,800
really think that Portugal based on any

1073
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:17,829
country's has the best local program

1074
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,390
because they didn't legalize cannabis

1075
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:22,519
they've decriminalized other drugs and

1076
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:24,139
legalized medical cannabis so just

1077
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:25,789
remember like I said internationally if

1078
00:36:24,139 --> 00:36:27,920
you're in this game it's only about

1079
00:36:25,789 --> 00:36:31,429
medical this is the second you do

1080
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:34,730
recreational no longer valid and in the

1081
00:36:31,429 --> 00:36:36,199
international space Israel's been big I

1082
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:38,179
know canna Tech is going on right now

1083
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:40,579
everyone should be at ICBC cuz it's way

1084
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:42,649
better for what's happening but Israel

1085
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:44,509
was kind of stuck in this horrible place

1086
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:46,160
for a good amount of years so much

1087
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:48,650
research so much developments so much

1088
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:50,149
patient focus I love Israel for doing

1089
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:52,340
that but now with them being able to

1090
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:54,050
export by the end of the year they think

1091
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,789
they're now going to be world leaders so

1092
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:57,260
what's that gonna mean a bunch of shitty

1093
00:36:55,789 --> 00:36:58,579
public companies are gonna list there

1094
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:00,890
with all this speculation that are gonna

1095
00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:02,989
do nothing be careful about that also be

1096
00:37:00,889 --> 00:37:04,759
careful about German exchange now that

1097
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:06,439
cannabis is legalizing here all these

1098
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,210
startups are gonna try to list publicly

1099
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,280
to do the same that they did in

1100
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:12,139
Canada to make these high market cap

1101
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,180
companies get tons of investment and

1102
00:37:12,139 --> 00:37:16,309
redeploy that in other sectors but that

1103
00:37:14,179 --> 00:37:18,409
is not how you start public companies

1104
00:37:16,309 --> 00:37:21,049
like you start public companies by being

1105
00:37:18,409 --> 00:37:23,389
a private company and scaling showing

1106
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:25,130
revenue showing real processes and then

1107
00:37:23,389 --> 00:37:27,108
listing Facebook didn't go public day

1108
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:28,640
one I mean any of these big companies

1109
00:37:27,108 --> 00:37:30,619
it's about position so when we make

1110
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:32,690
investments it's about having lots of

1111
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:34,940
pieces to make mas mergers and

1112
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:37,130
acquisitions that then can pre IPO and

1113
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:39,829
go public those will be huge titans of

1114
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:41,960
industry not little startup to sent

1115
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:43,608
shares maybe a 2 cent share company

1116
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,108
makes it to Amazon but most likely not

1117
00:37:43,608 --> 00:37:46,699
and if you find those ones let us know

1118
00:37:45,108 --> 00:37:48,679
who they are you're gonna see a lot of

1119
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:50,419
companies list in Israel the only thing

1120
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:52,009
I really really care about in Israel is

1121
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:54,559
like research and development clinical

1122
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:56,240
trials drug discovery like I've got

1123
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:57,920
about a twenty five million euro play

1124
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:01,429
where I'm like drug discovery plates in

1125
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,930
in Israel but I'm not producing like the

1126
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:04,940
cost of production there will be so high

1127
00:38:02,929 --> 00:38:06,529
that I think long-term it's gonna be

1128
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,960
challenging to do real massive

1129
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:10,430
production their Latin America's got a

1130
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,900
lot of talking right now everyone's

1131
00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:13,969
really interested in Latin America

1132
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,950
Colombia by far has been the country

1133
00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:17,899
most people have been discussing but we

1134
00:38:15,949 --> 00:38:19,489
know that when it comes to some products

1135
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,500
it's not about producing there and

1136
00:38:19,489 --> 00:38:22,849
shipping to other countries but like

1137
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,858
there's a lot of patients that need

1138
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:26,779
medicine there but with Mexico and

1139
00:38:24,858 --> 00:38:27,078
Colombia with all this talk compared to

1140
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,390
what

1141
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:31,339
actually real it's not as real as most

1142
00:38:29,389 --> 00:38:32,929
people would think so we're thinking on

1143
00:38:31,338 --> 00:38:34,880
a lot of those markets on like starting

1144
00:38:32,929 --> 00:38:36,949
them but not doubling down for world

1145
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,588
production you know Columbia

1146
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:41,088
specifically amazing for flour exports

1147
00:38:39,588 --> 00:38:43,159
with all the licenses though many

1148
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:45,380
companies got the license for analytical

1149
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:47,088
testing which then it didn't work really

1150
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,769
well for Volkswagen like testing their

1151
00:38:47,088 --> 00:38:50,170
own cars and saying that they were good

1152
00:38:48,768 --> 00:38:53,028
and if you guys remember

1153
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:54,680
sorry Germany it's the same thing in

1154
00:38:53,028 --> 00:38:56,869
Colombia a lot of companies got that

1155
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:58,669
license it's fine to do in-house testing

1156
00:38:56,869 --> 00:39:01,130
but don't do your own certifying

1157
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:02,630
Authority you're voided from UN compacts

1158
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:04,459
like if you do that it's a conflict of

1159
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:06,318
interest what I really care about are

1160
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:08,778
the non psychoactive licenses for mass

1161
00:39:06,318 --> 00:39:10,429
outdoor production for bulk oils and

1162
00:39:08,778 --> 00:39:12,018
then shipping to other countries the

1163
00:39:10,429 --> 00:39:13,518
psychoactivity side like the EU's

1164
00:39:12,018 --> 00:39:15,738
already said like if it's not from

1165
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:17,988
indoor or greenhouse or GMP for the oils

1166
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:19,338
those things can't be imported so 90

1167
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:21,259
percent of the Colombian investment

1168
00:39:19,338 --> 00:39:23,208
plays and strategies are not going to

1169
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:24,708
work and the Canadians ruined Colombia a

1170
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:26,208
little bit by bringing most of their

1171
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:28,308
indoor varieties down to Colombia to

1172
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:30,679
grow outside that we're doing great and

1173
00:39:28,309 --> 00:39:31,880
warehouses in Canada Colombia is a

1174
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:34,909
little different to grow plants outside

1175
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,920
so I think Colombia is gonna be major

1176
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:38,328
for a few companies that do it right but

1177
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,979
there's so much speculation there that I

1178
00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:43,339
haven't made major investments there as

1179
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:45,198
of now Africa's kind of unfortunately

1180
00:39:43,338 --> 00:39:47,808
been a show I'm sorry for the

1181
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:49,459
language South Africa had the best

1182
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:51,619
program moving forward their government

1183
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:53,568
went on strikes APRA the medicines

1184
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:56,028
agency there just got out of strike

1185
00:39:53,568 --> 00:39:58,130
there's 21 licenses that were applied

1186
00:39:56,028 --> 00:39:59,748
for one was disqualified and they now

1187
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:02,088
have a moratorium against new license

1188
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:03,409
applications clinical research in South

1189
00:40:02,088 --> 00:40:05,058
Africa will be incredible especially

1190
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:06,528
with the aids rate and what we'll be

1191
00:40:05,059 --> 00:40:08,690
able to see with clinical trials there

1192
00:40:06,528 --> 00:40:11,298
with cannabis and with AIDS research

1193
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:13,219
lassoo 2 also has like a bonafide

1194
00:40:11,298 --> 00:40:15,199
program the Canadians also destroyed

1195
00:40:13,219 --> 00:40:18,409
that by coming and doing lots of plays

1196
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:20,449
but Swaziland Zimbabwe issued those 37

1197
00:40:18,409 --> 00:40:22,608
licenses if anyone's been dissing Bob

1198
00:40:20,449 --> 00:40:24,019
Wayne knows that program it's not also

1199
00:40:22,608 --> 00:40:25,788
going to be a world leader it sounds

1200
00:40:24,018 --> 00:40:27,288
good on a press release but when it gets

1201
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:28,819
to boots on the ground it's not a real

1202
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:31,609
program but I think South Africa will be

1203
00:40:28,818 --> 00:40:33,318
the most bonafide program within 12 to

1204
00:40:31,608 --> 00:40:34,998
18 months in South Africa which I

1205
00:40:33,318 --> 00:40:35,798
already have applied for a license there

1206
00:40:34,998 --> 00:40:38,028
as well

1207
00:40:35,798 --> 00:40:40,739
Asia's been challenging like you had the

1208
00:40:38,028 --> 00:40:42,750
first hemp licenses in India like bang

1209
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:44,159
like the source getting to where

1210
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:46,679
cannabis is from in this in this area

1211
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:49,170
unfortunately all I see from like

1212
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:51,779
Philippines from Thailand from South

1213
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:53,700
Korea it's all about import I mean right

1214
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,500
now Vanuatu and some of these other

1215
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:57,838
countries want to have these programs

1216
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,460
but they're just not creating the

1217
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:00,869
programs in a way that's compliant

1218
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,500
internationally so and I look at these

1219
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:04,170
markets

1220
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,849
I think import markets highest standards

1221
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,680
lowest costs getting medicine to the

1222
00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:09,660
people who need it but I still have yet

1223
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:12,269
to see a major bonafide investment

1224
00:41:09,659 --> 00:41:14,190
strategy here and Australia has had such

1225
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:15,389
a challenging program as well that

1226
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:17,730
they've been around for a while in a

1227
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:19,500
huge hemp industry but they also other

1228
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:21,750
than partnering with a few Canadians or

1229
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:23,579
Israelis haven't through their program

1230
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:25,949
laws really been able to take huge

1231
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:27,449
international market share as of now and

1232
00:41:25,949 --> 00:41:29,429
remember from that risk Graham like

1233
00:41:27,449 --> 00:41:31,108
Australia's only two troops every time

1234
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:32,279
so it's like you could put all your

1235
00:41:31,108 --> 00:41:34,139
resources there but you're gonna get

1236
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,250
stuck in that little corner and that's

1237
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:38,250
hard to get back out if you guys

1238
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:39,539
remember that game so you know I'm

1239
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:41,639
almost done here but just thinking of

1240
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:43,500
like we've been talking about this in

1241
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:44,879
doing this for over a decade and there's

1242
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,380
all these new people or people that are

1243
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,510
observing this and thinking maybe I'll

1244
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,099
get in now or maybe on best a little bit

1245
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:51,810
into like some public companies to try

1246
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:53,400
to get your feet wet but when you're

1247
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:55,799
trying to like navigate this risk and

1248
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,599
understand what's happening you have to

1249
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,730
choose like where you're going to put

1250
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,170
your capital and when because time is

1251
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:03,300
the one thing that we don't have more of

1252
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:04,829
and like opportunity cost you put your

1253
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,230
time your capital into a market it

1254
00:42:04,829 --> 00:42:09,150
doesn't go anywhere you get distracted

1255
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:10,710
not every investment works not every

1256
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:12,930
country works not every program works

1257
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:14,639
and I've even seen great companies not

1258
00:42:12,929 --> 00:42:16,289
scale into unicorns because of some

1259
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:18,088
internal things or things outside of

1260
00:42:16,289 --> 00:42:20,369
their control so diversify your

1261
00:42:18,088 --> 00:42:22,230
strategies be in multiple places and

1262
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:24,150
know how if you're investing into one

1263
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:26,039
company what service is what products

1264
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:28,079
what things do they need and how do you

1265
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:30,420
invest in a way to create like circular

1266
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,309
value versus just like oh this sounds

1267
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,680
good I'm gonna put money into it if it's

1268
00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:36,150
not legal if it's not real you're not

1269
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:38,669
gonna make anything from it but we have

1270
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:40,559
to do it everything making medicine for

1271
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:41,820
like our sick grandparents so like if

1272
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:43,710
it's not a good company that thinks

1273
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,359
about patients first safe affordable

1274
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:47,849
medicine an alternative to

1275
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:50,219
pharmaceutical like drugs it's not a

1276
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:52,320
good investment because money is one

1277
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:53,730
thing but like what do you do with money

1278
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,530
it's like bullets in a gun it you could

1279
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:56,000
have

1280
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,590
houses full of bullets but if it's not

1281
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,239
on the battlefield at the right time it

1282
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:00,950
doesn't matter and that's where we like

1283
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:02,839
help investors to get their bullets like

1284
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:04,909
onto the battlefield to make impact in

1285
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,559
profit and get medicine to patients who

1286
00:43:04,909 --> 00:43:07,940
need it which is the reason we're all in

1287
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:10,130
this room today and always have to

1288
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:11,690
remember what you do matters we're

1289
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:13,880
creating an industry to give to future

1290
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:15,289
generations so if you're not comfortable

1291
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,329
with the products your investments are

1292
00:43:15,289 --> 00:43:19,340
making if you're sick grandma couldn't

1293
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:21,949
have those products don't do it because

1294
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:23,780
this is more of a responsibility of

1295
00:43:21,949 --> 00:43:25,489
investment and what we do than just a

1296
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:26,870
big money opportunity but there's enough

1297
00:43:25,489 --> 00:43:29,059
money for everyone to make this will be

1298
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:30,409
larger than tobacco alcohol we're gonna

1299
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:32,539
take major market share from

1300
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:34,579
pharmaceuticals and you want to get into

1301
00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:37,670
this now in five years

1302
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:39,529
your capital but will be like a cent one

1303
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:40,880
euro cent compared to like a 500 euro

1304
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:43,460
note for what it could have done for you

1305
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,410
perfect any time for cue later

1306
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:50,869
