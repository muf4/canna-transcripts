1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:06,559
uh and now uh we have two speakers

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,400
before lunch um this guy he's at he's at

3
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,320
all the things all over all over

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,400
everywhere all over the world he's the

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,719
ceo of 3c consulting and the managing

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,919
director of multiverse capital and he's

7
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:17,358
going to talk and we're all going to

8
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,879
learn stuff and it's going to be great

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,610
and i'm sure he's standing back there

10
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:26,198
let's hear it for nick easley

11
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:26,198
[Applause]

12
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,239
peru

13
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,920
so we'll hopefully that'll work out well

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,920
yeah mike uh spanish not that great

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,920
um

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,039
but at the same time

17
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,718
spain's relevance for how it's going to

18
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,480
play into international policies and its

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,000
production standards from what you're

20
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,159
doing in al maria and so many other

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,520
places from your club models the world

22
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,878
has a lot that it could learn from spain

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,800
as well so today we'll go through some

24
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,799
of that

25
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,239
just always a really important

26
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,640
disclaimer for me before i do a

27
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,040
presentation i'm not a lawyer i'm not an

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,519
investment banker i do fund management

um very possible i'll offend you i swear

31
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,920
often

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,759
but

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,600
other than ukraine

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,359
i haven't been wrong in quite a while

35
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:24,239
about something so uh let's just say i'm

36
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,239
not guessing uh next slide please

37
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,158
so i've been in this space for about 16

38
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,920
years legal cannabis

39
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,840
from you know being in farm country

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,359
wisconsin is a small kid not speaking

41
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,719
spanish obviously

42
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,319
being a romance language linguist for

43
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:41,039
the military espares

44
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:41,039
spanish pero

45
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,840
and i'll just say right now like catalan

46
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:51,118
so challenging so many different words

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,799
i've been feeling ignorant for days here

48
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,478
but

49
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,439
after the military i went to colorado in

50
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,599
2006 as a medical patient we didn't have

51
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,118
commercial medical cannabis yet it was

52
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,798
still like caregivers you couldn't

53
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:05,040
really grow it sell it kind of like

54
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,280
non-profits kind of like your clubs here

55
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,039
but then in colorado in 2008 we had the

56
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,800
first commercial medical cannabis

57
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,039
program and that's where you could have

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,680
a license as a company and you could

59
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,280
sell it and grow it and actually profit

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,280
even though california started earlier

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,000
in 1996 with that with the compassionate

62
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,919
care act they still didn't have a legal

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
commercial medical cannabis until much

64
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:28,958
much later colorado we were also the

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,800
first like adult use market in 2014 so

66
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,039
having worked through those markets now

67
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,200
close to 40 states we've worked in more

68
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,400
countries than states surprisingly even

69
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,839
though the united states is where

70
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,280
everything's happening

71
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,280
so next slide please

72
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,359
what a world it's been this this little

73
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,039
map went from one little thing to so

74
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,239
many other new countries

75
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,679
now

76
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,519
in the united states cannabis is

77
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,040
federally illegal

78
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,280
even though we're going to be doing

79
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:58,239
close to probably 30 billion in revenue

80
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,759
this year in 2022

81
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,519
all of these other countries it's legal

82
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,878
from like a medical standpoint or canada

83
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,200
from a recreational standpoint or

84
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,560
uruguay or soon to be you know germany

85
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,560
or switzerland with their kind of weird

86
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,800
pilot program or kind of like amsterdam

87
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,479
with uh the wheat experiment

88
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,239
we're starting to see this change happen

89
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,598
in the united states it was slow and

90
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,680
then it got a lot faster and

91
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,000
internationally you know we're close to

92
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,439
just about a billion in revenue

93
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,680
for like medical sales because

94
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,439
international's not like my arm hurts a

95
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,519
doctor has to give you like a bona fide

96
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,560
prescription for medicine for flour or

97
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,959
oil and only in canada or in the united

98
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,000
states legally are we actually making

99
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,920
products

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,598
like vape cartridges edibles cookies

101
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,318
beverages this is all like psychoactive

102
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:42,560
thc side everything international

103
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,958
medical is always about like the api

104
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,439
like the flour or the oil and it has to

105
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,959
be compounded by a pharmacist so don't

106
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,479
bring me an investment deck later to

107
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,560
make like weed chocolates in germany

108
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,238
next year because you know medicinal

109
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,598
weed chocolate so we're a little ways

110
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,920
away from that but eventually those

111
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:02,479
things are coming uh yes sir oh nice

112
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,479
dominion

113
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,759
perfecto okay

114
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:09,518
one thing that's very important though

115
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,598
when you look at this map

116
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,039
as an investor

117
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,119
as someone who works in the industry i

118
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,959
look at this map and then i always cross

119
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,560
reference it on this map

120
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,079
what are the pix countries these are

121
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,839
countries that have the same

122
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,000
international drug development standards

123
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,319
as the united states as the european

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,160
union so if you're making a drug product

125
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,240
a medicines or a standardized api and

126
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,479
doing clinical trials you'd better be

127
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,478
doing it in one of these countries

128
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,879
because your drug development process

129
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:37,918
your clinical trials and all of the apis

130
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,839
and intellectual properties you're

131
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,519
developing from those places if it's not

132
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,119
in one of these it doesn't get into the

133
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,560
big places

134
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,600
so you might have a grill license in

135
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,280
colombia

136
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,879
but if you're not doing your clinicals

137
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,478
let's say with argentina or in another

138
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,079
place those standardized drugs are not

139
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:55,199
going to get to market

140
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,639
so you're like okay where is it legal

141
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,720
are the pigs countries and then i'm also

142
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,319
like where is the best climate and then

143
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,840
you start to see certain places in asia

144
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,800
that are really critical mexico really

145
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,799
good portugal and spain

146
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,799
countries are really important

147
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,319
especially if you're thinking

148
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,000
international medical for like

149
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,918
pharmaceutical development which is

150
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,839
different than compassionate use which

151
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,839
is how we're currently legalized today

152
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,680
clinical research clinical trials just

153
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,279
to do a high level on them they're very

154
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,720
[ __ ] expensive and they're more

155
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,758
complicated than you could possibly

156
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,960
imagine unless that's what you do

157
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,600
so if you're thinking about doing

158
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,038
clinical trials and making apis know

159
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,199
that going through this process could be

160
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,038
over 562

161
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,199
million dollars

162
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,279
on average to get a standardized api

163
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,280
approved through phase four

164
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:52,959
so it's great we do need to study

165
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,198
parkinson's and all of these other

166
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,719
things with cannabis but it's expensive

167
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,720
to make those standardized drugs that's

168
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,960
why you see geopharmaceutical have such

169
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,560
a huge valuation because they went

170
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,719
through that process

171
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,199
not saying those are good medicines or

172
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,199
quality or affordable

173
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,160
or ethical but

174
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,840
it's just part of the normal game

175
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,280
so i've talked about this for the last

176
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,879
few years it's super important it's

177
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,279
still not happening as fast as i would

178
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:22,399
like but in december

179
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:24,318
of the previous year 2020 when the u.n

180
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,000
rescheduled cannabis this was one of the

181
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,600
biggest milestones for international

182
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,120
medical cannabis development and

183
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,319
actually changing like international

184
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,519
cannabis law and drug policy but by

185
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,360
changing it and saying that it's no

186
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,120
longer the same as heroin and that it

187
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,439
has medicinal value it just needs more

188
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,160
study that should have been the gateway

189
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,240
to just open the entire floodgates

190
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,080
into people countries now like changing

191
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,840
their controlled substances act

192
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,279
countries coming up with programs or

193
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,799
more specifically

194
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,198
international narcotics control board

195
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,639
stated that everyone who is a member of

196
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,759
the single convention which pretty much

197
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,038
everybody

198
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,960
needed to amend their controlled

199
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,639
substances act and make some sort of

200
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,758
national or federal office of medical

201
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,038
cannabis

202
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,360
none of these countries are doing that

203
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,719
yet there are 29 countries though that

204
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,960
are starting to change these things

205
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,520
especially one big one germany right

206
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,680
close by them amending potentially their

207
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,120
controlled substances act

208
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,639
or leaving

209
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,918
the single convention and changing

210
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,680
something and then coming back into it

211
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:21,918
like what a world of change that would

212
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,759
be so this is super critical

213
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:26,079
and it was like the number one of like

214
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,360
three major things that need to happen

215
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,719
i was just a little wrong because it's

216
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,960
happening a little slower i thought we

217
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,360
would have jumped on it but coronavirus

218
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,799
and now ukraine were kind of

219
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,639
busy with a lot of other things going on

220
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,079
at the moment

221
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,560
another huge thing for european

222
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,000
countries novel foods did happen many

223
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,038
times in the past people said it wasn't

224
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,120
going to happen it would never be

225
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:46,000
scheduled this is novel food cbd no no

226
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,199
no

227
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,439
well

228
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,879
goodness with brexit that like any of

229
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,879
the

230
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,319
united kingdom countries are not really

231
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,560
subject to that

232
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,319
but this is the case and as of like this

233
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,598
morning there's only two companies that

234
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,840
have the license for contract

235
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,759
manufacturing for novel foods in europe

236
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:04,799
and if they did it for cbd they're

237
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,199
probably going to do it for other

238
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,720
cannabinoids what about cbn what about

239
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,400
cbg what about all of them most likely

240
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,000
we'll see

241
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,038
another huge thing i mentioned is

242
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,439
there's all these hundreds of

243
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,959
cannabinoids that were very like just in

244
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:20,639
the beginning of studying many of these

245
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,079
some we we haven't even known about

246
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,400
others we've known about for years but

247
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,878
have no idea how they interact in the

248
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,239
united states delta eight which under

249
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,000
the farm bill and hemp production you

250
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,080
can grow a lot of hemp you know and

251
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,200
isolate and extract you know just delta

252
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,560
eight

253
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,839
if you've done delta eight just by

254
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,278
itself you may or may not have a

255
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,200
pleasant experience

256
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:40,479
but the dea is pretty much on the verge

257
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,278
of making this a controlled one

258
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,920
substance even though it's derived from

259
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:47,360
a plant that can be legally produced

260
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,958
so even if you think about some of these

261
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,720
other like oh it's kind of not like

262
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,518
spice or anything naughty like that but

263
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,278
like

264
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,440
it's this other way i can make profit

265
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,200
just remember like cbd in 2014 you're

266
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,519
like we're going to be billionaires

267
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,000
and then now this giant 2.2 billion

268
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,480
dollar cbd market that's happened

269
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,278
sadly probably less than 10 percent of

270
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,278
products have coas or bonafide are not

271
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,958
just snake oil or tested and safe which

272
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:13,039
is so sad because it's a great

273
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:15,039
cannabinoid just people are [ __ ] it

274
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:16,958
up same thing delta eight great

275
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:18,958
cannabinoid people just [ __ ] it up

276
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,559
and taking advantage of the rules so if

277
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,239
you're on that path just know major

278
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,958
things are happening and being

279
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,320
considered like heroin or cocaine

280
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,000
not going to be good for an investment

281
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,760
strategy doesn't really work well for

282
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,080
anybody other than the united states

283
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,480
right now currently

284
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,639
now now in the united states like

285
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,240
federally illegal remember

286
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,000
completely illegal to do everything that

287
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,799
we do in america

288
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,480
um we follow state law each state's kind

289
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,399
of like its own little country like they

290
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,560
legalize medical or recreational choose

291
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,639
how to do licensing and each and every

292
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:53,599
state has done it differently but from

293
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:56,319
1996 until today

294
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,080
we have 46 states that have some sort of

295
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,200
medical cannabis law we still got a few

296
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,200
holdouts

297
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,440
but then during coronavirus we added

298
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,759
nine more states for adult use like we

299
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,760
have 19 adult u states they're not all

300
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,439
currently doing sales yet

301
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,919
but that's like our california's

302
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,560
oregon's washingtons nevadas arizona's

303
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:17,039
new mexico's colorado's michigan's

304
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:20,639
maine's massachusetts new jersey new

305
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:23,919
york virginia connecticut

306
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,919
am i missing one i think i hit them all

307
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,759
starting to close but when you think

308
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,919
about how much revenue is possible and

309
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,039
tracking this and logging this

310
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,039
canada thought they were going to take

311
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,919
over the world had the first

312
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:39,278
legal program other than uruguay but as

313
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:40,719
a big big nation

314
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:42,000
we're going to set the stage and the

315
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,240
standards for everything that's going to

316
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,559
happen internationally for how adult use

317
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,240
cannabis happens it's not the amsterdam

318
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:50,319
like cannabis clubs or the spain ones

319
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,639
this is a good model but not where it's

320
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,879
taxed and logged and tracked

321
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,958
and taxes are paid here

322
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,559
it's just starting but the clubs i've

323
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,319
gone into here recently like we have

324
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,879
social clubs in the united states where

325
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,480
you can buy and consume cannabis on site

326
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,120
but they have air handling systems

327
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,720
massive like fire sprinkler suppression

328
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,159
all these different things

329
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,480
some of the ones i was in let's just say

330
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,319
security odor safety

331
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,560
quality you know kind of lacking there's

332
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,680
some great quality too but you know god

333
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,599
bless that people have access to

334
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,519
medicine but really watch what's

335
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,000
happening in the united states here and

336
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,679
when you see this patchwork of you know

337
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,759
california started it but colorado

338
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,759
started the commercial side and as it

339
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,480
started to go around the country we've

340
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,639
got i mean senate bill 711 in north

341
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,039
carolina about to pass south carolina

342
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,838
just pushed a big bill forward georgia

343
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,679
gave six licenses about to give 16 more

344
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,920
and in some of these places

345
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,679
you have one of six licenses for 12

346
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,278
million people

347
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,559
in colorado

348
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:50,958
1300

349
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:53,359
cultivator licenses for 6 million people

350
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:55,359
and we cannot grow cannabis in colorado

351
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,600
and take it to other states so we can

352
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,440
never cross state lines with things so

353
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,680
all the cannabis i grow in one state and

354
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,760
process i have to sell in that state and

355
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,278
of course i you know would never want

356
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:06,319
our consumers to take that to another

357
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:07,919
state

358
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,959
but as this is really starting to get

359
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,278
bigger

360
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,799
most of the states

361
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,240
haven't even really come up with huge

362
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,838
programs yet or know how to deal with

363
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,720
the revenue or they didn't give enough

364
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,240
licenses early so it's not just evolving

365
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,399
quickly it's like oh

366
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,919
150 billion dollars of sales go from the

367
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,000
illicit market to the legal market

368
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:27,838
overnight it takes time to do that

369
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,720
transition but when you think about the

370
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:34,800
wholesale cost of let's say one kilo in

371
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,920
california legal of cannabis

372
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:37,599
you might be

373
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,360
three thousand dollars let's say at a

374
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,040
you know a good standpoint

375
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,480
but then on in illicit market

376
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,078
twelve hundred

377
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,000
a thousand because they don't have to

378
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:52,399
pay taxes health care testing packaging

379
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,078
all these other laws but it's there's

380
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,320
more licenses and the price starts to

381
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:58,078
come down consumers continue to switch

382
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,079
over to that and we're also doing so

383
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,239
many new sorts of products that

384
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:03,838
of that close to like 28 billion dollars

385
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,480
that's going to happen this year

386
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,040
beverages edibles concentrates

387
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,079
cartridges it's not just wheat and flour

388
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,399
anymore

389
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,159
i mean that's less than 50 of all of the

390
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,039
skew sales in the united states so even

391
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:19,439
if you just said 25 billion in let's say

392
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,679
like legal cannabis last year sales

393
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,800
that means like 12.5 billion was not

394
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,078
weed

395
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:27,439
it was standard consumer packaged goods

396
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,199
so how often do you think of like a

397
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,440
brand in the store of a product versus

398
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,680
an actual product itself the tomato

399
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,519
versus a ketchup or a salsa

400
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:38,000
the same thing's happening here and that

401
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,679
trend will continue internationally so

402
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,519
the brands that are starting to jump

403
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,958
internationally even non-psychoactive

404
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,120
and getting brand recognition and

405
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,518
exposure really lucrative investment

406
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,120
targets as well

407
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,959
we've got more states coming online like

408
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,639
i mentioned north carolina there were

409
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,399
states that passed and legalized and

410
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,720
then like their supreme courts wouldn't

411
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,958
allow them to actually do their programs

412
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,399
you know connecticut right now closer to

413
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,399
new york city

414
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,159
than massachusetts where adult uses are

415
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,919
way up in the north and maine but

416
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,838
they're doing weird lottery systems to

417
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,360
get these licenses and if you know how

418
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,040
to stack those lotteries you can get

419
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,959
more chances that you're going to win

420
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,639
but then these social equity programs

421
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,719
which really have started in the united

422
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,959
states where you know minorities people

423
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,600
have lower income or had cannabis crimes

424
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,559
in the past can get licenses in some

425
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,560
states

426
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,239
easier than others but i've had states

427
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,000
where i had a client lose a license a

428
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,278
decade ago for like having a gram of

429
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,198
weed record for having a little

430
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,799
possession but now that would maybe get

431
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:35,359
you a license before

432
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:37,439
a multi-billion dollar public company

433
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,199
so navigating social equity not only is

434
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,279
it the right thing to do like to

435
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:42,799
increase like female ownership minority

436
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,600
ownership in the cannabis industry but

437
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,198
to also think that every state and new

438
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,040
place that we legalize there's less

439
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:51,278
people going to jail

440
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,719
for like small amounts of cannabis

441
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:55,278
and last year there was over a million

442
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,959
cannabis arrests of which over 80

443
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:59,519
percent are to minorities it's not

444
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:01,359
represented like not representative

445
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,959
so as we legalize cannabis in the us

446
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,720
we're also doing like massive social

447
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,638
justice it's the same thing that's going

448
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,560
to happen throughout europe and maybe

449
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,399
not from past cannabis crimes but just

450
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,919
know like that angle it's not only the

451
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,919
right thing to do but it could give you

452
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:16,399
a unique edge in helping to get into the

453
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,799
market earlier

454
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,639
i make fun of canada a lot i have always

455
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:22,958
and i've not ever been wrong about

456
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,680
canada so when you see even this was the

457
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:27,119
shot from 2020 like of how like

458
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:28,719
everyone's going public let's raise

459
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,560
capital there it's easier than raising

460
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,879
private capital and then you have these

461
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,799
big market troughs and then now when you

462
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,480
think about this morning when i when i

463
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,519
did this if there's a laser on this i'm

464
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,920
gonna love it oh [ __ ] yes okay

465
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,399
so this was coronavirus march that was

466
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,838
march 18 through 2022 like that's we

467
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,519
made more money that day than probably

468
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,920
in the history of the world

469
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,360
and then you know spikes happen biden

470
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,838
shit's not going to get crazy and then

471
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,199
just this [ __ ] for the last year

472
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,880
february

473
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,599
was the only time we had a positive

474
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,759
month in cannabis stocks this last year

475
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,199
great for deducting losses but i know

476
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,879
companies that should be at twenty five

477
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:06,479
dollars a share that are like six

478
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,278
dollars a share

479
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,680
and it's not correctly valued so i sadly

480
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:13,360
have like bought there there there there

481
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,198
i keep buying in these like troughs but

482
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,959
it's not the bottom yet

483
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:18,559
so this is a very you know i hate

484
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,039
canadian public companies there's great

485
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:23,119
us companies there to get capital into

486
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,198
america but

487
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,320
it's almost that time to really really

488
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:27,439
start thinking about some of those

489
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,440
companies because they're super

490
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,160
undervalued some of them are doing like

491
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,839
400 million dollars in revenue a quarter

492
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,319
and they have massive positions in

493
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,560
multiple states so they talk about those

494
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,639
msos those multi-state operators that

495
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,278
work in many states they have different

496
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,440
companies in each state in order to do

497
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,600
that it's not like a cross-border thing

498
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,040
that's happening yet but just know that

499
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,278
like when we see the numbers that are

500
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,198
happening on revenue and projections

501
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,639
we're a quarter or two away from people

502
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:56,799
actually taking some cannabis companies

503
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,039
seriously and i'm not talking about like

504
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,639
some cannabis companies

505
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,319
i mean just i mean this was from like

506
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,839
three years ago and it's perfect for

507
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,919
this week because they just bought their

508
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,519
competitor if you know about the hexo

509
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,240
couple hundred million dollar toxic debt

510
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,078
thing

511
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,318
so it's like this keeps happening the

512
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:15,519
canadians they can only do about five

513
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:17,599
six billion in legal sales for adult use

514
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,679
which they're not even close to yet

515
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,159
but they can't produce at a cost that's

516
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,759
low cost high quality and export that to

517
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,679
the rest of the world they were the

518
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,318
first ones to have the chance to do that

519
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,160
but they failed at doing it successfully

520
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,879
and as you know in spain some of those

521
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,720
big dogs came over here spent 80 100

522
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,160
million euros trying to get licenses in

523
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,880
spain for medical production or in

524
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,200
portugal and isle of man all the you

525
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,320
know north macedonia you name it they

526
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,319
were there so were we

527
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,038
but then that same license that cost 80

528
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,720
million euros sold for 3.1 million euros

529
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:52,558
a couple years later

530
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,160
so it's like every license is not

531
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:57,359
valuable it's about the time that

532
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,880
license is there who can they export to

533
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,079
what's the quality of that it's not just

534
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,520
like raise a bunch of money and go

535
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,119
public

536
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:04,639
also like all these greenhouses that

537
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:06,159
have gotten shut down there compared to

538
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,840
like colombian operations and others

539
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,360
we're not shutting greenhouses in

540
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,759
production in columbia we don't have a

541
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:13,839
huge market yet but like all these big

542
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,839
markets continue to sell things and

543
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:18,399
close these things down and then a lot

544
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:20,879
of times they're being taken apart

545
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,120
shipped to america and re reconstructed

546
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,559
to actually do it there

547
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:26,558
so it's been a very big challenge for

548
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:28,000
foreign nationals

549
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:29,519
people that are not u.s residents to

550
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,880
invest into cannabis in the united

551
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:32,079
states

552
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,520
if you're from london you've got the

553
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,439
home office and this division of like

554
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:36,960
foreign crimes act and some bs you could

555
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,400
even get in trouble for investing into

556
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,160
real estate in america that's for a

557
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,679
cannabis company

558
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,279
so you got to be really careful like

559
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,038
international investors we have funds to

560
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:46,960
help navigate that but if you're trying

561
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,400
to invest into some of these things

562
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,079
even just last week the biden

563
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,600
administration saying like yo not a good

564
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:52,879
idea to buy cannabis stocks if you're

565
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:54,798
going to work for us

566
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,960
like that was one of those dips last

567
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:58,160
week is not a pretty thing

568
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,679
it's the same thing so if you're an

569
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,840
investor you're international there's

570
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,600
tons of great international things to do

571
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,439
there's tons of great u.s things to do

572
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:06,879
but hands-on cannabis companies you got

573
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,320
to be really careful about how you do

574
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,080
that because

575
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:12,798
seizing assets being prevented at

576
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:15,038
borders can be major major problems

577
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:16,879
just jump into europe quick

578
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:19,519
donde estamos por fin

579
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,960
we've seen major changes but not major

580
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,359
revenues

581
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,679
main reason being international in order

582
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,519
for a prescription to happen you need a

583
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,038
doctor to actually write that and have

584
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:30,720
education

585
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,640
think that smoking or using a plants can

586
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,480
be better than anything on the market

587
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,320
there might not be cost insurance all

588
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,440
these issues to navigate that's why

589
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,839
germany's

590
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,360
i don't want to say set a good standard

591
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,678
or a model but they've they've done the

592
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:46,000
most out of any country so far in

593
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,679
getting patients access to medicine now

594
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,519
there's a lot of ways around that system

595
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,280
we do the price you guys remember was

596
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:56,400
like 26 30 euros a gram we're down now

597
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:58,160
seven to maybe 15 euros a gram

598
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,080
10 to 20.

599
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,400
so i mean prices are coming down they've

600
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,079
got access to medicine how many times do

601
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,519
they buy it once for a better can jar

602
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,038
and then just put whatever in it you

603
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,879
know it's it's a unique program but

604
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:11,038
there's not a walgreens or a cvs

605
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,559
pharmacy chain you've got thousands of

606
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:14,480
these small little pharmacies that

607
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:17,359
you're doing two kilos to this one three

608
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,360
kilos to that one majorly hard market to

609
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:20,719
navigate as an international producer

610
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,240
even though everyone talks about selling

611
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,240
to germany and importing there and being

612
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,640
the biggest but as we all know that's

613
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,480
not so much the case

614
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,799
you know here in spain i

615
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,880
i'm a big fan of the climate here for

616
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:35,519
just agricultural production i always

617
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,520
think where can i produce this cheaply

618
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,519
environmentally responsible and undercut

619
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:42,400
competitors at like the highest quality

620
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:44,319
standards so being picks country spain

621
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,480
is good for that your climate's good not

622
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:48,000
super expensive to do business

623
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,519
i mean portugal and spain are the best

624
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,359
climates in europe where there's

625
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:52,960
political climate and agricultural

626
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,519
climate that kind of

627
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,038
overlay overlap each other and then also

628
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:57,759
your laws are finally starting to catch

629
00:20:57,038 --> 00:20:59,599
up

630
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,879
so i i do think that not only for your

631
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,439
domestic and country you've got

632
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,880
opportunities but also on an export

633
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,320
standpoint because

634
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,240
you could produce cannabis so much

635
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,720
cheaper than they could in germany or in

636
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,640
denmark or in france just based on

637
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,400
farming your agricultural knowledge plus

638
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,240
all of the ancestral wisdom that you

639
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,360
have with this plant which has allowed

640
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,919
some of these clubs to actually happen

641
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,599
clubs are pretty awesome i highlighted

642
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,520
gray area it's not great it's pretty

643
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,439
black and white and it's it's kind of

644
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:29,119
like the united states it's not legal

645
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,279
it's not companies

646
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,959
it's kind of this allowed thing kind of

647
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:34,240
like coffee houses in the netherlands

648
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,919
but then

649
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,679
not actually happening

650
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,960
but it's happening

651
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,440
it's

652
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,440
so these little gray gray areas kind of

653
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,279
like the netherlands or here or like

654
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,279
weird little clubs in switzerland that

655
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,759
are going to be starting for their like

656
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,759
clinical trial adult use study which is

657
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:54,240
crazy to me

658
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:56,079
but thank god these things exist

659
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,640
because it's actually sparked consumer

660
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,079
culture like genetics breeding so much

661
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,320
experience with that here and also

662
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:04,000
seeing what consumers like but also like

663
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:06,319
the other day we saw like infused

664
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,919
cheetos you know in a social club and

665
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:10,839
you're like that's you would get so sued

666
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,759
in america if you did something like

667
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:15,279
that this is a big deal for us right now

668
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:16,879
a friend of mine over there i mean we

669
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:18,798
can all talk about this all day but this

670
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,400
is really important for spain and for

671
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,480
europe even though it's really shitty

672
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,080
for ukraine it's like

673
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,400
our groups have probably lost well over

674
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:28,319
10 million so far in ukraine just

675
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,720
because there's massive inter like

676
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:34,480
industrial hemp applications there

677
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,798
cheap land great climate not eu taxes

678
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,400
insulation textiles protein like all of

679
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:39,279
the things industrial that we talk about

680
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,200
hemp

681
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,558
this was the place to actually do it

682
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,000
because it's too damn expensive in

683
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:44,960
europe to even try to do this in the

684
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,880
beginning

685
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,840
so a lot of investment i know probably

686
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,679
150 close to 200 million that was

687
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:53,519
designated towards ukraine that now has

688
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,000
no home

689
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:56,879
nor does ukraine very much

690
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,960
but

691
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,880
so if you are an industrial hemp and you

692
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,640
are in the eu and you are producing just

693
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,880
no like funders are interested again in

694
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,320
industrial stuff because the battlefield

695
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,320
where they were going to be like doing

696
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,639
all their deployments someone else is

697
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,918
doing a major deployment there right now

698
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,200
so

699
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,960
really got to think about that and also

700
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,038
like what we can do but there was so

701
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,798
much focus there in this last two weeks

702
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:20,158
i've just seen that shift to so many

703
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:20,879
places in europe

704
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,960
so

705
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,320
something you could kind of think about

706
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,600
here

707
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,798
this is one of the most important

708
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:28,959
markets to me but it's one of the

709
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:30,639
smallest but it's based on the climate

710
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,798
and the cost of reduction

711
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,400
like did anyone have coffee this morning

712
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:36,720
by chance

713
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,038
maybe a couple yeah like did did we grow

714
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,480
that in spain

715
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:42,558
probably not probably came from one of

716
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,640
these places or africa or places there's

717
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:46,480
better climates for producing plants

718
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,799
that are from there the same as our

719
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,880
plant so anywhere near the equator is

720
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:52,639
massive i mean peru with a few new

721
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,720
medical licenses have been like

722
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,400
incredible to watch uruguay's medical

723
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,400
program has blown up in opportunity

724
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,000
zones in a good way and they're doing

725
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,480
major exports now colombia when they

726
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,720
change their law to actually allow oil

727
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,960
and flower exports

728
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,558
huge game changer

729
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,240
but it doesn't open up all the markets

730
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:12,240
it doesn't teach doctors it doesn't get

731
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,839
new prescriptions going

732
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,278
so every time like i've

733
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:16,798
we've gotten five of the ones in

734
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:18,880
columbia and every time i look at them

735
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:20,879
like these are going to change the world

736
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,760
if we can just hold on long enough to

737
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,520
not go out of business in the process

738
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,919
it's like short-term and long-term plays

739
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:30,240
like crushing it in america with adult

740
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,080
use revenue international everybody's

741
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,480
bleeding and that's where we need tons

742
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:36,079
of capital as well so

743
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,400
the long term i mean africa has been a

744
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,798
challenging continent for us i mean we i

745
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,038
didn't uh get the new nigerian kind of

746
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:46,720
research play on here but from lesotho

747
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:48,240
swaziland zimbabwe south africa

748
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,360
i mean south africa's program is also

749
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,960
going to be i think the one that's

750
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:52,240
changing that whole nation and how

751
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,840
they're going to allow adult use and

752
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,839
kind of really pushing to regulate it

753
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,439
like alcohol and when you see the prime

754
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:00,079
minister come out being like yo we're

755
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,679
going to make 150 000 jobs and like x

756
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:04,240
amount of new revenue

757
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,679
in a country like south africa like

758
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,519
somebody's getting re-elected like

759
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,278
somebody's going to take like there's

760
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:10,960
going to be an example there but it's

761
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:13,038
also not a huge

762
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,480
massive export opportunity yet just

763
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:15,919
based on the standards but the one

764
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,960
country for medical that's important

765
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,360
down there

766
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,880
is south africa because it's the one

767
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:23,599
country in the continent that's a picks

768
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,120
country and the climate is pretty decent

769
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:26,639
down south there

770
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:28,558
this has been slow we've got a few new

771
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,679
ads thailand's news this last couple

772
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:31,200
weeks like

773
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,120
their medical program took us forever to

774
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,880
get started with the university

775
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:37,278
it went from death penalty to like oh

776
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,600
medicine you know and then now like

777
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:41,919
let's get our tourism back by legalizing

778
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:41,918
weed

779
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:45,119
you know i don't want to say ballsy but

780
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:46,639
that's

781
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,959
i'm really impressed with thailand's

782
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,400
stance now because they've seen that

783
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,480
the international narcotics control

784
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,559
board interpol they haven't gone after

785
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,720
canada they haven't gone after uruguay

786
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:58,720
they haven't gone after these clubs here

787
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,839
they're like i think we can do this you

788
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,919
know there's enough precedent that

789
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:04,000
they're not going to come in and get us

790
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,759
i do see that like with china and some

791
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,359
of the others like from a hemp side it's

792
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:08,720
going to get a lot bigger

793
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,798
but and you've got a couple picks

794
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,558
countries in green there as well and i

795
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:14,639
mean we tried to deal with sri lankan

796
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:17,119
like their medical program but very very

797
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,960
very challenging um to do business in a

798
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:20,479
few of these places so watch what's

799
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,960
happening in thailand here this next

800
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,400
couple uh couple of weeks

801
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,400
australia's medical program is getting a

802
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,840
little bit better it's been slow a lot

803
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,679
of money and investments been put into

804
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:30,959
that that hasn't actually yielded giant

805
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,120
returns yet

806
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,640
met patients are getting medicine but

807
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,158
just based on their cost of production

808
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,919
they're not exporting all over the world

809
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,760
yet either it's kind of like israel

810
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,960
australia we've made some big medical

811
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:42,720
plays

812
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,079
that just aren't happening yet but

813
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,640
something that's super sexy about

814
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,558
australia and back to brexit

815
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,720
is that by the uk not having to give up

816
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:51,759
all of their commonwealth territories

817
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,440
the amount of [ __ ] they're going to be

818
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:55,200
able to do in these other countries for

819
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,759
their industry even with like isle of

820
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,679
man and gibraltar and

821
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:01,119
i've built greenhouses a couple of those

822
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,960
other islands i can't remember right

823
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,759
there in the channel but

824
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,679
yeah

825
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:08,400
yeah jersey guernsey

826
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,278
all of those are like so valuable for

827
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,360
the

828
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:12,960
uk kind of play but it's not going to

829
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,000
really be impactful the european union

830
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,159
side

831
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,679
gracias so just the last couple things

832
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,360
about raising capital it's hard as hell

833
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,120
to raise money everyone that's in a

834
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:22,398
business if you're not raising money

835
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,719
you're making money or you're not a

836
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:27,278
company you got a couple options

837
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,558
so as a cannabis company in the united

838
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:30,079
states we're federally illegal

839
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:32,079
internationally we're still sometimes

840
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:34,079
like heroin

841
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:35,359
you gotta like not just be like cannabis

842
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:36,798
and we're gonna like make a ton of money

843
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:38,719
and we're gonna replace alcohol or the

844
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:41,440
next big farmer some big stories you

845
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,440
have to put very good models together

846
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,200
very good data rooms and actually show

847
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,038
and prove to investors like why you're a

848
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,640
good investment thesis

849
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:49,839
that did not format well but like when i

850
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,440
think about

851
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:52,639
impact analysis like what are the things

852
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,320
that are happening these are the most

853
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,120
important triggers for me internally

854
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:57,119
asked of this morning

855
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:00,000
of all the companies that are trying to

856
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:01,119
do this they're talking to the wrong

857
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,558
money

858
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:04,319
they don't know how to raise money they

859
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:05,599
think they're worth a billion dollars

860
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:06,639
but they haven't done a dollar in

861
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:07,839
revenue

862
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,679
there's no way of setting themselves

863
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:11,678
apart from the competition or securing

864
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,440
intellectual property they haven't done

865
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,038
a single sale yet

866
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,399
like there's nothing happening so if you

867
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:17,919
do want to raise and need to raise

868
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:19,519
capital like

869
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,038
what kind of company are you what kind

870
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,200
of investors are going to invest into

871
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,119
you how much money do you need how are

872
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,558
you going to use it what's in it for me

873
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:28,558
like what am i going to get back as an

874
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:30,879
investor like you have to show that like

875
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:33,278
we don't just invest into non-profits

876
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,760
like you have to show traction and prove

877
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:38,240
your story to your investors and at this

878
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:39,519
stage it's hard

879
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,798
if you think you're doing fine now and

880
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:43,839
don't need to raise more money you're

881
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:46,000
[ __ ] wrong like it's scale scale

882
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:47,599
scale scale it's take positions it's

883
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,919
grow it's grow right now that's what

884
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,439
investors want to hear so start early in

885
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,840
your capital raising processes if you

886
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,840
have an idea or a company start to look

887
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:58,398
for experts to help build those business

888
00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:00,000
plans understand the financials don't

889
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:01,439
just tell an investor i need 5 million

890
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,038
bucks to do this and i say how are you

891
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,038
going to use it they're like well we're

892
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:07,278
putting together a budget i'm like

893
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:09,919
don't ask until you know and you got to

894
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:11,440
know and be able to defend your numbers

895
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,200
there's all the other ancillary things

896
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,880
it's not just cannabis companies that

897
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,880
are super valuable so you don't have to

898
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,399
worry about that like the real estate

899
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,440
the packaging the intellectual

900
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:23,359
properties the apis the equipment the

901
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,600
financing of the equipment financing of

902
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:28,158
inventory the lawyers

903
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:30,319
so much opportunity here for us all

904
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,919
the ip side if you don't protect your ip

905
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:33,359
ask an investment company don't tell us

906
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,799
you have ip unless it's bona fide

907
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:36,719
protected and you should do this

908
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,398
internationally and domestic

909
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,798
and if you think back to this in closing

910
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:43,278
here world's changing fast we need to do

911
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:45,038
things fast and quick and right and it's

912
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:47,119
this industry we cannot afford more

913
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:49,200
mistakes to look bad like north

914
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:51,359
macedonian imports going to poland

915
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,080
somehow finding their way into germany

916
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,839
like those games don't work anymore like

917
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:57,359
we have to take responsibilities this

918
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:00,079
industry and do this well because it's

919
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:02,000
happening so fast and you think about

920
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,599
how fast it is happening

921
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,119
i always pull this up we always talk

922
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:06,079
about this like think about that map in

923
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:07,519
the beginning

924
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:09,918
there's little positions or like

925
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:12,079
licenses import export once you start to

926
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,480
control distribution on things you own

927
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:16,079
the chain for life that's why seagram's

928
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,159
that's why british american tobacco

929
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,000
that's why they all do did what they did

930
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,919
there it's the same thing for cannabis

931
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,079
companies you got once in a state or

932
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,080
once in a country to like be in if it's

933
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:27,038
too early and not right it makes sense

934
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:29,599
not to

935
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:31,839
but we only have about three to five

936
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:33,278
years to really finish establishing the

937
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:34,480
whole board

938
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:36,640
and it's only going to happen with

939
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,720
capital new companies and helping to

940
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,559
change those regulations but we have to

941
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,960
set a higher standard for ourselves like

942
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:44,398
professionally as an industry and what's

943
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,319
the importance of this plan it's not

944
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,558
just about the money that's what like

945
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:50,240
telling the story is important but we're

946
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:51,759
literally changing the [ __ ] world

947
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,599
with a plant that all of us should be in

948
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:56,240
jail for like dealing with and a lot of

949
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:58,000
our friends are and we're in the past so

950
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,839
when you join this track and like you're

951
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,919
doing something bigger than yourself and

952
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:03,599
it's important and what you do matters

953
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,278
even if you are a cannabis marketing

954
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:07,599
firm all the way down to like a

955
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:09,440
custodian cleaning a greenhouse or like

956
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,278
the big executives like on the toronto

957
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,440
exchange it doesn't matter but we're all

958
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:16,240
part of this the u.s alone almost half a

959
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,159
million jobs reported

960
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,440
so we got big changes and a long way to

961
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,799
go and we've barely gotten started

962
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,798
internationally in por finis

963
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,219
[Music]

964
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:46,720
[Applause]

965
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,840
one more time let's head for dick always

966
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,839
very informative always fantastic
