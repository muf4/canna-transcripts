1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,839

i'm your good con science i'm the good

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,240
conscience of this conference and i

5
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:16,719
think that might be the reason why alex

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,118
always wants me to speak here you can go

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,640
home and tell the people and maybe your

8
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:21,679
kids if you care about what they think

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,679
about you

10
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:26,640
it's not all about money so it's not all

11
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:29,118
about business there was a step one

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,839
guy some kind of in blue

13
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:34,960
who has been proven in more than 25

14
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:37,759
years of activism that he's not

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,960
out there for the money

16
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,920
looking for

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,000
big business looking for big money

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,359
we collected a lot of money spent it for

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,600
legalization

20
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:51,039
reached kind of legalization did a lot

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:55,359
of the development we've seen in germany

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:59,039
and so it was a business and

23
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:01,198
a much sense conference kind of that

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,160
and i'm doing the joking job again um

25
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,959
unless

26
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:08,079
i've seen lots of you

27
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,879
giving a on that kind of politics

28
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:13,039
and

29
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,039
bringing society forward and explaining

30
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:27,359
[Music]

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,680
why should you spend money for others

32
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,280
for society or something

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,920
if you are

34
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,920
in charge for your company but i've also

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,879
seen a lot of companies coming here to

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,719
germany

37
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,239
spending a lot of money to to bring

38
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,519
their

39
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,438
name

40
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,798
between the people

41
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:49,679
become well known having big plans

42
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,680
uh managing money in germany and then

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,840
seeing well it was not like i thought

44
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,640
that end of

45
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,040
2017 you have to have 100 000

46
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,960
expectations in germany

47
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,360
and the whole legalization train is not

48
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,559
going that fast forward as i thought

49
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,118
with

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,118
10 years

51
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,478
now since colorado made that decision

52
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,318
politicalization in 10 years and we have

53
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,720
still only two

54
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,799
countries in the world that legalizes

55
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,239
cannabis that's not your plan right

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,480
that's not why you are here that you are

57
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,560
here because you see perspectives that

58
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:25,919
you are here because you see fast

59
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,840
development of that cannabis business

60
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:31,518
so it's also also in your

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,239
interest to spend some money for

62
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,319
politics for activists or for your

63
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,519
industry association bringing the

64
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,839
political

65
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,319
situation forward

66
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,560
otherwise uh well you shouldn't take a

67
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:47,759
lot of time if you wait until the

68
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,479
attackers come kind of alone

69
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,518
and

70
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:55,199
it's also in the interest direct

71
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,959
of your company because it makes good

72
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,359
karma to spend a little bit of your

73
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,319
money for sense

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,040
i don't care much about company names

75
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,039
and i don't know

76
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,199
but

77
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,519
from the american companies i know

78
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,359
one that's dr bonner

79
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,560
because i heard they spent a lot of

80
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,040
money for

81
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,239
things that make sense and not just for

82
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,840
their

83
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,080
direct advertisement in soup

84
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,000
they spend money for the cents

85
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,040
and there are some other companies doing

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
that like icbc icbc alex watchers is one

87
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:40,798
of them uh who understood that um taking

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,759
