1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,000
uh for his personal youth per household three or  per person at the household per person household  

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,640
I believe that we will have an increase in  prescriptions from Physicians for patients who  

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,960
want to use our medical Canabis for the treatment  of their disease they have to ask those license  

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,560
seeds are you making money are you making  money for the cultivation of cannabis at home  

5
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:27,159
you can actually get your seeds from the cabis  associations from the cultivation associations  

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,679
even if you're not a member you should actually  be able to get get your seeds for home grow  

7
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:43,119
from them so that's the plan from the from the  cultivation association yes that's the [Music]

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:49,280
second but one thing I'm really curious about is  so Dentons is is it the largest law firm in the

one of the largest law firms in the world um it's  a very esteemed International uh law firm uh and

so how can you tell us a little bit about how you  became the head of the European cannabis group for  

18
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:13,319
Dentons how that unfolded yeah actually you're  right Dentons is one of the largest law firms uh

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:20,639
worldwide with a great number of different offices  in in various jurisdictions in Europe in Northern  

20
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:27,079
America South America as well as in Asia MH uh  not to forget Middle Eastern Africa uh and uh  

21
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:34,880
I think since two weeks also in the Philippines  um with the law fir who has joined our Network  

22
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:47,359
in Mala amazing um um it actually happened uh back  in 2016 uh so uh some time ago uh when Germany was  

23
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:55,160
actually on the edge to legalize cannabis for  medical purposes uh there was and we can come  

24
00:02:55,159 --> 00:03:02,120
back to that in in a minute an very interesting  Judgment of of the highest administrative Court  

25
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:11,360
in Germany the so-call Bund M uh who at that point  in time allowed patients who at that point in time  

26
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:21,040
had only a special permit from the be Farm to use  cannabis for their treatment of their disease um  

27
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:28,400
and uh they actually one of the patients actually  wanted to grow at home mhm and um uh he actually  

28
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:36,400
informed the Bay Farm is the German FDA uh that  uh following the uh permit to use cabus for the  

29
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,360
treatment of his disease and there were only 600  to 700 patients at that point in time he wants to  

30
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:49,320
grow uh and the Bay Farm he wants to grow at  his house at at home because for for various  

31
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:56,560
reasons because he if he said if if I'm allowed  to to use it for the treatment of my my disease  

32
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,840
why can't I grow it at home and uh the Germans  are very good in sending ceas and deist orders  

33
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,960
and that's what the Bay Farm did and he went to  court through all the instances and in the last  

34
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:16,079
instance before the highest administrative cour  in Germany he actually won uh with the uh giving  

35
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:23,359
him the allowance that the permission actually to  to grow cannabis for his uh treatment at home so  

36
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,879
setting a a precedent basically yes absolutely uh  that was at that point in time for the legislator  

37
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:38,000
for the government a nightmare 600 Growers of  Canabis in Germany Allowed by by the highest  

38
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,879
administrative court so what they did they very  quickly reacted to it uh in 2017 in March 2017  

39
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:51,959
uh they legalized cannabis for the treatment of  uh in medical side for the treatment of various  

40
00:04:51,959 --> 00:05:01,879
diseases upon prescription from Physicians U  and um of course also then with the goal to  

41
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:12,439
uh uh disallow the uh respective home grow at that  point in time um and uh actually the irony abounds  

42
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:17,439
but go go on that is seven years later that's  seven years later and that's that's actually at  

43
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:26,240
that point in time they they um they're looking  for cultivators in Germany so what happened but  

44
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:33,120
at this point in time was tender you're talking  immediately in March 2017 uh they they there was a  

45
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,800
need for various patients who got the prescription  from the Physicians to to get cannabis products  

46
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:46,879
MH uh mainly flowers at that point in time U and  um and all of a sudden there were importers and  

47
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:55,240
of course cultivators and as you know Canada in  the US but in particular canab where we're years  

48
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:03,319
ahead of Germany uh in that respect at that point  retirement back in 2017 and uh we had a cannabis  

49
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:09,879
practice and we still have a Canabis practice in  Canada uh at Denton mhm uh and all of a sudden uh  

50
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:16,000
there was a great interest in the German Market by  in particular the Canadian cultivators I remember  

51
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,560
and and back in April 2017 just one month later uh  the first uh uh uh cultivator uh wanted to enter  

52
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,519
the German market and I can name them because  its public domain it was canopi growth uh and  

53
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:35,759
we advised them how they could enter the market  they acquired a company which was called mat Ken  

54
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:44,000
at that point in time which was their actually  distributor for the small amounts of uh uh uh THC  

55
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,839
rated products of of flowers uh for the small  group of patients uh in the German Market but  

56
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:56,679
all of a sudden ex it exploded so the question  was who can handle that in Germany for them who  

57
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:03,439
has the knowledge uh and I am heading also the  life sciences practice uh in Germany uh and I'm  

58
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:09,759
advising Life Sciences companies which means  companies in the fields of pharmaceuticals uh  

59
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,480
Diagnostics medical devices and biotechnology  already for over 20 years I was myself in the  

60
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:23,160
industry uh so it was a n natural fit so it was a  natural fit that uh cannabis for medical purposes  

61
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,840
uh is is then handled by my me and my team  from the berin office now did you Vive for  

62
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:34,599
this position I'm curious or did or was it uh a  pointed upon you or did you want did you were you  

63
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:41,320
interested in no I was very interested because  we were following the uh uh Court decision and  

64
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:48,959
the development of that uh Court decision at the  highest administrative Court in Germany closely  

65
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:56,959
because there there was some something on the edge  I would say uh very interestingly and as such uh  

66
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:03,759
we deeply dived into to the new legislation there  was a new law which was Cannabis the Cannabis act  

67
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,480
for medical purposes yeah uh in order to advise  our clients accordingly and since then we are  

68
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:16,840
very much looking forward to each and every  regulatory uh changes that is amazing because  

69
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:24,919
I remember I Met You in 217 and I was actually and  I had you know been in the industry for a while  

70
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:31,360
and uh I was I was really impressed with what you  were doing I was impressed how you were doing it  

71
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,320
and uh I was just kind of I just thought it was  kind of cool that hey Denton has a cannabis uh  

72
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:47,000
division in in Europe so that's that's phenomenal  and then we take it seven years later and I think  

73
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:57,080
um the big elephant in the room these days and  uh is that uh is Germany is close to legalizing  

74
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:06,520
decriminalizing modernizing something so we hear  a lot about what's what's going to what's what's  

75
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:13,840
happening what's going to happen in Germany and  uh you know we hear about phase one we hear about  

76
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:21,360
phase two and I hear some other interesting things  about like seeds and clones and I hear thing about  

77
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:29,840
about medical cannabis in in Germany would you  give us a quick overview Peter of what the heck  

78
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,040
is going on in Germany because I know a lot of  people are really excited about it how much time  

79
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:40,039
do we have for the can can speak about it for  the next two hours I mean how about the cursory  

80
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:48,559
overview yeah now I think was the the Milestone  was of course back in 2017 the legalization  

81
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:54,439
of medical cannabis I think that was really the  Milestone uh and triggering the following events  

82
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:02,240
uh which was then uh the new government uh which  was elected actually introduced the legalization  

83
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,480
for recreational Cannabis Coalition the  traffic Coalition which which is uh the  

84
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,840
social Democrats the free Democrats and the  green party they introduced that into their  

85
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:19,639
Coalition uh agreement uh with two sentences  only uh they wanted to legalize cannabis for  

86
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:27,759
recreational purposes so that's how they actually  started uh then months really nothing happened um  

87
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:34,919
and uh what they then actually did they triy  to find a way how can we do that uh because  

88
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:41,000
there is a very strict legal framework as we all  know they are the three different un conventions  

89
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,840
the most most important one the 1961 un single  convention which uh of which Germany is also a  

90
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:56,320
member but not only Germany it's also the European  Union which is a member uh and as such the uh uh  

91
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:03,800
restrictions for the legalization of recreational  Cannabis not only cannabis but for any kind of  

92
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:12,439
Narcotics and cannabis is of course respectively  uh uh defined as such uh is prohibited so that  

93
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,000
is actually what uh uh the German government  took into consideration when they put that into  

94
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,600
their Coalition agreement nobody thought about  the legal hurdles MH and all of a sudden there  

95
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,279
were more than one legal hurdle not only the UN  conventions and and and we know for example Canada  

96
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:35,319
in back in 199 legalized cannabis recreational  purposes not really uh taking much care about  

97
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:44,040
the UN conventions however uh Germany Germany is a  member of the European Union as you all know U and  

98
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:52,679
um as such they have to adhere to the respective  also European uh regulations uh which means in  

99
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:58,759
uh particular the shenon agreement which is the  basis for the European Union uh and of course  

100
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:08,960
all the protocols following out of this shenen  agreement so back in October 2022 uh the German  

101
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:19,200
government presented a legalization concept very  nicely I would say drafted uh they wanted to uh  

102
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,640
cultivate cannabis for recreational purposes in  Germany under the government control they wanted  

103
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:33,799
to distribute to this cannabis for recreation  purposes via uh license dispensaries license  

104
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:40,120
means also under government control in order to  legalize Canabis recreational purposes in Germany  

105
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:48,120
to the full extent as we actually have seen  that in Canada um they knew that there are legal  

106
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:56,320
hurdles so they went to the European commission  and asked can we actually do that why did they  

107
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,440
ask because it could have moved forward of course  uh because the European commission as well as all  

108
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:09,240
other European member states could initiate  a respective uh uh legal actions before the  

109
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,519
European court of justice for the breach of the  Shen so just so the audience understands what this  

110
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:22,319
what this means basically you're saying that the  EU is basically acting as a centralized Federal  

111
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:30,000
Authority that has Punit or can be punitive uh  take take measures take punitive measures if you  

112
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,559
maybe that's not the right legal word but they  can they could sue the respective country they  

113
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:42,079
could withhold funds for other things for example  yeah punative punative actions I would say is the  

114
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:49,759
right the right expression you know Alex uh they  could actually initiate as I said respective legal  

115
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:56,840
proceedings before the European court of justice  right and Germany had just recently lost again I  

116
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:02,759
would say big thing uh before the European court  of justice and they didn't want to risk that again  

117
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:09,120
which is I think understandable what was what did  they lose uh uh the first one was with regard to  

118
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:16,399
the uh toll for private cars uh and their toll  system which they wanted to implement uh which  

119
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:23,679
was not uh in line with to system in the road  yeah yeah or yeah but just for p no we have it  

120
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:30,839
for we have it for trucks uh for all trucks which  are on the on the German Auto oh uh but we didn't  

121
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,840
have it we don't have it for private cars other  countries have it for private cars you know like  

122
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:41,920
Austria or France uhhuh exactly Czech Republic  they they all having also so we're digressing  

123
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:47,199
but I'm such a political science nerd why would  that not be constitutionally legal if it's or  

124
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:53,440
why would that be not okay because they wanted to  privilege the German the German drivers the German  

125
00:14:53,440 --> 00:15:00,160
uh uh inhabitants the German people uh they they  wanted to reimburse them honest that was was one  

126
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:07,480
of gun early that was that was one of those those  plans cool so so you think so you think that that  

127
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,800
that that because they that was shot down or they  they lost that decision you think that was one of  

128
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,599
the reasons they didn't no they they actually  were asking uh the the European commission can  

129
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:27,920
we do it the European commission said and well uh  our minister of of Health K laaba said we had very  

130
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:33,399
productive talks with the European commission  was that the euphemism of the day and and all  

131
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:38,679
of a sudden you know this whole plan was in the  bin you know unfortunately because I think that  

132
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:43,559
was would have been the best way to legalize it so  I so I have a question you think that would have  

133
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:50,079
been the best way to legalize it if you were  the health minister of Germany would you have  

134
00:15:50,080 --> 00:16:00,440
done it the Canadian way and just have ASU all  um advice from from the higher ups if you will  

135
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:06,280
very difficult question uh you know do you let  me let me rephrase it so I don't put it on you  

136
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:13,959
per se but do you think what what do you think  would have happened if Germany had just gone for  

137
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:20,360
it like that they would have been sued before the  European court of justice and uh which would have  

138
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:27,759
put all the whole program on a hold uh it would  like an injunction yeah yeah you can't proceed  

139
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:36,240
if you already and stopped by the European court  of justice to initiate the respective uh uh law  

140
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,519
for the legalization so if you would ask me what  would I have done there are of course ways from my  

141
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:52,039
point of view uh to at least use the uh I wouldn't  say loopholes but the possibilities uh in the UN  

142
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:58,319
conventions and in the Shen agreement uh and I  would probably have decided to do the same way  

143
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,120
as Switzerland for example is doing it that we  have scientifically controlled pilot projects in  

144
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:10,839
in various cities in various regions um in order  also to gain some data what kind of impact does  

145
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:19,000
it have the legalization on on the community on  on the on the users um and and then decide how we  

146
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,640
can actually move forward maybe Lobby then with  these generated data uh the proper legalization  

147
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,680
now this is basically and this is phase would be  phase two we'll talk about phase one but this is  

148
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,560
this is more of a phase two thing where you  would um because what the European as far as  

149
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:44,599
I understand legalization is is okay under the  opes of health and research are so some of the  

150
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:50,679
things you're talking about within the convention  yeah that's that's correct for medical purposes  

151
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:56,759
you can of course legalize cannabis which Germany  has done uh which is totally in line with the UN  

152
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:03,680
conventions and the respective sh agreement and  if you then start a scientific project scientific  

153
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:10,440
purposes is also possible under the UN conventions  if you start a scientific pro project trying to  

154
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,960
understand what kind of impact the legalization  of Canabis recreational purposes has uh and then  

155
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,440
gain data from that and then decide how you  how you going to do it in the future that is  

156
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,360
a perfect legal way how you could do it you still  would have the control of course with regard to  

157
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:35,919
the cultivation with regard to the distribution  well not each and every consumer would have got  

158
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:42,480
access to the respective sources in these pilot  projects because they you can't roll that out  

159
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:49,079
Nationwide or German wide you can use it in  uh or can establish it in various cities you  

160
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:55,639
know for example let's talk about Berlin we have  maybe 10 15 different dispensaries where actually  

161
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:02,640
consumers registered consumers could uh buy uh  cannabis for recreational purposes uh and this  

162
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,200
is then spread out in other cities maybe in other  areas other regions in Germany uh and and then of  

163
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,720
course you can actually gain the respective data  which you correctly said is actually the second  

164
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,960
step of the legalization model which Germany  is now using uh but that that is would have  

165
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:26,720
been my favorite solution very much the same as  Switzerland is doing it right that's uh yes I I I  

166
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:33,160
tend to agree with you uh Peter um I'm a decrim  guy for sure but I think you could decrim and  

167
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,440
still not have the Social Clubs you could have  just said well we'll have possession you can  

168
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:44,720
grow three plants that's pretty benign but the  Social Clubs so this the Social Clubs phase one  

169
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:55,480
let's talk about everyone's beloved phase one uh  in in Germany which is controversial at least um  

170
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:01,279
there's a I know I've heard a lot of different  opinions on phase one I have a I have my own  

171
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:09,240
take on it um very curious uh to hear your take  on phase one social social clubs Peter what are  

172
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:15,480
you thinking let's let's talk about the the facts  first I would say what what is Phase One what does  

173
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:23,599
it all Encompass so in phase one we have also  two different Steps step one is hom grow each  

174
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:32,439
and every adult uh can actually grow up to three  female plants at home and can use the Canabis  

175
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:39,400
cultivated from by this plants or from this plants  uh for his personal youth per household three or  

176
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,880
per person at the household per person household  so if you have three three people in the household  

177
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:51,520
you have nine nine plans U and that that's  that's the first step the second step is the  

178
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:56,639
what you said cannabis clubs which is not really  the Cannabis Club system which we know from Spain  

179
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:04,240
it's totally different uh I would say cultivation  associations where up to 500 members can actually  

180
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:12,079
grow cannabis in a community MH U and can then  use the Cannabis which is cultivated uh at the  

181
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:18,439
uh cultivation Association for their own personal  use okay uh for the recreation so they can hire a  

182
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:25,240
surrogate or they can choose a surrogate to  grow for them do we know we don't know that  

183
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:32,559
yet by heart uh because the kind abis gazettes  the Cannabis law the Cannabis act for legalizing  

184
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:39,839
the recreational use of cannabis is not very  precise on that it's relatively silent how this  

185
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:46,959
structure should function and they leave it to  the states within Germany to really then establish  

186
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:54,039
the legal framework under which conditions uh  the cultivation associations can operate so it  

187
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:59,319
could be yes you're right it could be uh the  assumption is right right that they actually  

188
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:08,039
can source that out that they can combine uh uh  their need or their cultivation possibilities and  

189
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:15,720
source that out to a party who actually the uh the  possibility to grow and has a knowledge to grow I  

190
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:23,000
don't believe that uh this will materialize  Frankly Speaking but we'll see what the what  

191
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,359
the various States will come out with and the  onus is put upon the local or the region or the

192
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:37,919
bundus of each per each bundus stat has can  make up their own time place and manner rules  

193
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:46,920
or locals or municipalities I I would I wouldn't  say that you can foresee chaos uh but you can  

194
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:56,360
see a heterogeneous definitely approach because  this federal law leaves it now for to the various  

195
00:22:56,359 --> 00:23:05,439
States within Germany to really uh uh in very  much detail Define the legal framework uh how  

196
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,640
these cultivation associations can operate then  we can assume uh that the the regulations will be  

197
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:19,280
more liberal in Berlin and more strict in Bayern  for example yeah the assumption is not uh out of  

198
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:27,039
the world I would say it's we'll see how that  will really work out but first of all you know  

199
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:33,559
the law has to the parliament uh it has done so  already in the first reading the second and third  

200
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:43,119
reading which is the normal uh way in order to  uh establish respective laws in law making uh  

201
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:49,799
will actually is planned for next week uh in in  Germany and we'll see how the outcome will what  

202
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:55,039
the outcome will be as of right now do is that  vote scheduled on the what do they call it the  

203
00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:03,599
bundus uh what they call Bund bundes T has an  agenda of course I have looked yesterday it  

204
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,799
was not on the agenda yet but that doesn't mean  anything it could be put on the agenda it's put  

205
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:15,159
on the various committees which have to look  at the law as well and from there let's assume  

206
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:21,560
it would pass second and third reading next week  it will be uh retransferred to the bundes which  

207
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:31,839
is the council uh and from there it will be either  passed uh and then only be signed by the president  

208
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:38,679
uh for the implementation or actually refr which  is possible uh to a mediation committee if the  

209
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:47,160
bundesrat decides that there should be additional  amendments and changes in the law right and right  

210
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:54,000
and so right now most people are assuming that  when when it gets to the bundus rat it's going  

211
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,440
to go through because it's not politically  expedient for anybody to oppose it because  

212
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:06,240
of how many greens are in the local districts  this is just a little bit that I've heard and  

213
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:15,880
the greens could then stop it if ESP day wanted  to the I'm a little confused because I'm I'm not  

214
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:21,720
a a I'm not an expert on on German politics by  any means but but I thought basically it's not  

215
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:28,360
basically the the the opinion is that it will pass  out of the the bundus rat yeah the bunus R doesn't  

216
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:33,959
have a veto right uh it is not a law which the  bundes part has to actually the possibility to  

217
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,799
stop it but they can actually ask for additional  amendments which they have done already because  

218
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:45,440
before it came to the parliament it was already  being discussed within the bundus who actually  

219
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:53,720
said we would like to have a number of amendments  as such then the law was being retransferred to  

220
00:25:53,720 --> 00:26:03,120
the various Ministries and everybody was working  on various parts of that law and now uh the new  

221
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:11,479
uh amended uh uh draft of Bill looks a little  different uh in in some respects so they could  

222
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:17,839
they could um I won't say grievance but they  could say well we don't we would we don't  

223
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:24,679
agree with this new little change for example for  example yeah um but we have to look into the some  

224
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:31,720
other uh effects or some other part part s of  that draft law which are interesting for for in  

225
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:37,319
particular the Cannabis industry on the medical  side you know what is happening as well that's  

226
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:43,639
in the draft law is that cannabis and THC related  products will be taken out of the German narcotics  

227
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,720
okay so I want to get to that in just a second  because I actually think that that is the most  

228
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:55,640
exciting exciting thing so let's just talk about  let's just finish up phase one here first so the  

229
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:01,840
phase there's two phases of phase one one and the  first phase is what's going to happen let's say  

230
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:07,000
the bundas dog passes it and then it goes through  the bundus r and let's say around April 1st it  

231
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,559
it becomes legal what's becoming legal is three  plants you can grow now and you can possess what  

232
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:19,759
25 50 grams 25 grams if you are in the public and  50 grams if you're at home 50 grams if you're at  

233
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:29,000
home and then the second phase of phase one will  go will uh uh uh be like Li they're saying then  

234
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,079
they implement the social the social Clause these  asso cultivation associations but at the same time  

235
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:45,639
and that's within this first this first uh this  first step is that the uh narcotics act will be  

236
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:51,120
amended okay so now here I think is I think this  is the elephant in the room what we're about to  

237
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,719
talk about now now I don't think this is what  I don't think a lot of people know and this is  

238
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:01,440
a little more esoteric when it comes to the can  G Law and something that I'm very excited about  

239
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,840
we know that the market driver in Germany or in  Europe right now is the German medical marijuana  

240
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:12,119
Market that's where the real Market lies yes  there's CBD stuff but that's a little am ambiguous  

241
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:16,519
with the German Medical Market you pretty much  know pretty much right where where things stand  

242
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:23,039
yeah cannabis is coming off the narcotics list  will this if if passes will this be part of a  

243
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:32,359
phase one of phase one will this happen right like  April if it if assuming soeter please tell us what  

244
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:36,879
do cannabis coming off their narcotics which  I'm getting like Goosebumps just talking about  

245
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:44,480
it what does that mean for the medical marijuana  industry in Germany I don't have my crystal ball  

246
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:53,000
with me so but what do you think that might mean  but it definitely oh let's come take a take a look  

247
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:01,200
into the current prescription uh policies today  a physician who wants to prescribe Canabis to a  

248
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,920
patient is prescribing a narcotic this is he needs  to have a special permission to do that he needs  

249
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:14,920
to use actually special prescription blocks uh  in a different color uh in order to prescribe  

250
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:20,920
narcotic for patients for the treatment of  his disease that is to a certain extent a  

251
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:27,600
psychological Hurdle from my point of view if you  just change that into an RX product which means  

252
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:34,639
just the product which is uh being prescribed as  as any other RX product for example what would  

253
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:42,080
be an example of another AR for example any kind  of heavy painkillers for example uh who are not  

254
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:48,679
a narcotic but who uh are under prescription  um so that is something which is comparable to  

255
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:55,320
that then okay um and and they of course a great  number of different uh Pharmaceuticals which has  

256
00:29:55,319 --> 00:30:00,000
have to be prescribed in order to get get it from  the pharmacy you can't just get it off the shelf  

257
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:09,079
it's not everything which is not OTC over the  counter uhhuh um and as such uh I believe that  

258
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:16,799
uh we will in have an increase in prescriptions  from Physicians for patients uh who are who want  

259
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:23,480
to use medical Canabis for the treatment of their  disease it'll be less cumbersome of a process for  

260
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:29,360
the doctor to prescribe it for example per se  absolutely then there are some side effects  

261
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:39,279
of that the prescriptions will last longer the  the because the prescription for Narcotics has  

262
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:46,599
has to be filed filed with the pharmacy relative  in a relatively short period of time the other  

263
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:53,159
prescriptions are are valid months for for a  longer period of time uh and U of course you  

264
00:30:53,160 --> 00:31:00,680
can use this uh uh prescription also in in  European member states oh wow but you know  

265
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,200
you can't get Canabis of course in a French  but you could at least have it on you and not  

266
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,559
be arrested theoretically yeah theoretically yes  and the courts would throw it out you still could  

267
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:15,839
be arrested you won't get you won't get THC  rated product with a German prescription the  

268
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:21,679
French Pharmacy I think that's clear but the is  possible you know but I think that the the major  

269
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:27,560
effect is and I think that's something which the  industry is also expecting that the description  

270
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:33,879
will increase everybody said Well if you get the  legalization and if you can have home grow and the  

271
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:41,520
Cannabis cultivation associations uh the medical  Market will uh decrease uh we we we don't I don't  

272
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,759
believe that and the number of Market players  in the market don't believe that as well uh it  

273
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:54,440
may uh because you know a patient who is currently  using cannabis even if he's a self-pay and is not  

274
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:01,759
reimbursed by his health insurance company yeah he  gets goes to the next pharmacy around the corner  

275
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:10,359
getting a which has a specific quality which is  overseen uh by the regulatory authorities so he  

276
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:16,240
knows what not expensive like it was a few years  ago also right right competition has lowered the  

277
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:23,160
price the price has been significantly decreased  in comparison to 2017 2018 2019 I when it was like  

278
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:31,759
25 a gram yeah um I have another question because  will this make uh I know that now if pharmacies  

279
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:36,279
have to handle narcotics in a certain way in  Germany right you get it you receive it and then  

280
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:43,720
you have to repackage it yourself or what's the  well I guess my question is because when when when  

281
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,000
cannabis comes off the narcotics list this will  be a a less cumbersome process than for doctors  

282
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:58,640
to prescribe it will it be a less cumbersome  process for pharmacies to uh procure and uh purvey  

283
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:07,720
it probably not uh first of all in Germany the  Cannabis product is defined as an extemporaneous  

284
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:14,279
mixture uh which why is that so uh in back in  2017 and it's obvious nice to look back into  

285
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:19,879
history uh the German government wanted to get the  products quickly on the market for the patients  

286
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:27,040
who very in need of cannabis mhm so if you have an  extemporaneous mixture which means uh there is a  

287
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:32,839
pharmaceutical which is in the pharmacy but which  needs to be prepared by the pharmacist according  

288
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:38,039
to the prescription you know that is different  from a readymade pharmaceutical which you have to  

289
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:44,319
take can take off the shelf those Pharmaceuticals  need a a marketing authorization which of course  

290
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:52,759
needs clinical trials and B has to go through  the uh price finding process of the German GBA  

291
00:33:52,759 --> 00:34:00,559
bundas which is actually for Pharmaceutical it's  fixing the price for the market this was avoided  

292
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:08,199
by putting cannabis products on the market as  extemporaneous mixtures got but there was a butt  

293
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:16,480
always a butt if you have a butt if you have a an  extemporaneous mixture the pharmacist is obliged  

294
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:22,400
because he is doing something to the product in  this case quality control grinding packaging he  

295
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:29,440
uh uh gets a 100% search charge on the purchase  price that's the reason why we had this 25 EUR  

296
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,559
at the beginning per gram that's a man is that  mandated or is that compulsive no it was it was  

297
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:40,799
uh in is in the law actually so the the pharmacist  had to do that of course they were happy to do it  

298
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:48,120
but they had to do it yeah that's absolutely  F so basically they already had this provision  

299
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:53,359
that that that didn't mean that they they had  to adhere to such stringent standards like other  

300
00:34:53,360 --> 00:35:00,200
narcotics might be with cannabis specifically  so well the the definition of cannabis product  

301
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:06,159
extemporary mixtur extemporary mixtures will not  change uhhuh and I think what is clear uh even  

302
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:15,279
if the Cannabis products will be taken out of the  narcotics Act and the uh put into or transferred  

303
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:22,120
into the new Canabis act uh probably the same  security measurements will apply uh there will  

304
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:28,519
not be less security for example putting it in a  safe having a safe place for the you don't think  

305
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:35,800
no this is will probably not happen uh because  the security measurements for medical cannabis  

306
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:42,440
from my point of view will not be reduced you  will have the same uh handling process of those  

307
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:51,800
products as if they were narcotics fascinating  and so that seems like they had a little bit of  

308
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:57,000
special status beforehand and now they won't have  any spe they'll just they'll actually it'll be the  

309
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,039
opposite because it won't because any another  drug that wouldn't be a narcotic would would  

310
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:07,800
not have to be handled as stringently as cannabis  you think is going to be still handled yeah well  

311
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,560
no if you well if you have a morphine for example  a morphine rated product this is the same as it's  

312
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:20,320
a narcotic it's handled espe especially at the at  the pharmacies uh you can't just put it on on the  

313
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:27,240
open shelf so uh and that's will remain the same  there will be no changes to that okay so the main  

314
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:32,879
issue of cannabis coming off the narcotics  list is that they the the doctors will be  

315
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:43,440
able to prescribe it uh I don't want to say with  impunity but they just they they have more leeway  

316
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:51,519
yes absolutely that is from my point of view the  the most important effect of uh the of taking  

317
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:57,599
cannabis and T Canabis rated products THC rated  products out of the German well I think this is  

318
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:03,319
the onest I think to me this is this is almost  the biggest thing that's happening with I mean  

319
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:08,160
this is what's going to have the most effect  immediately I think and what I've also heard  

320
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:15,239
is there's no more tender for domestic production  in in Germany when this passes nobody knows about  

321
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:19,519
that could you speak to nobody knows I've heard  that they're not going to they're going to open  

322
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:25,119
up domestic production they won't put quotas on  the limits of how much you can grow can you speak  

323
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:34,679
to that pet there are many Rumors in the market  right now uh so um back in 2018 2018 actually  

324
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:43,039
there was uh a way to find cultivators in Germany  and which was a tender process as we all know the  

325
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:50,159
Bay Farm actually tendered out uh respective lots  for the cultivation of canab of medical Canabis in  

326
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:57,159
Germany and three companies have been assigned  licenses at the very end of that long lasting  

327
00:37:57,159 --> 00:38:02,480
process which was actually stopped by the court  in the first in the first place remember right and  

328
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:14,519
then then reestablished uh and afria uh as well as  Demian and Aurora won the respective 13 licenses  

329
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:21,440
for cultivation of cannabis which in fact was  limited in quantity is still limit in a quantity  

330
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:28,039
it's actually 10.4 metric tons over a period  of 4 years which means means 2.6 metric tons if  

331
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:35,719
I'm not mistaken per year plus my plus a certain  certain threshold of probably 10% uh which could  

332
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:43,439
be could be actually cultivated uhhuh so that is  uh what happened so at that point in time so now  

333
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:50,159
of course also these licenses are questioning hey  what is going to happen if the four years are over  

334
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:56,599
uh is there another tender process uh is there  a licensing process for the cultivation of of  

335
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:01,799
Medical cannabies in Germany can others actually  participate then or what is the Bay Farm actually  

336
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:09,039
planning the Bay Farm currently is relatively  silent on that it is of course pending uh uh  

337
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:15,159
thoughts at the Ministry of Health what is going  to happen you know you have hom grow uh with three  

338
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:20,679
female plants per adult you have the cultivation  associations and then you have a limitation on  

339
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:29,239
the cultivation of medical cannabis with a very  strict tender process it really doesn't uh dive  

340
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:37,239
too well right yeah and as such we will see but  at this point in time this is unclear there is no  

341
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:43,519
clear pass forward and do you know what percentage  approximately what percentage of cannabis cons  

342
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:51,280
medical cannabis consumed in Germany is has to  be imported uh well if you look into the import  

343
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:59,760
quantities in the last years and let let's look  into 2023 but I don't have the uh last quarter  

344
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:09,240
figures but it it was uh around 23.4 metric tons  without the last quarter of imported cannabis so  

345
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:19,879
that would be 90% yeah I would say a little less  than that because the 2.6 metric tons per enom can  

346
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:29,840
be increased you know by by a certain percentage  but U 85 85% around that figure well if you ask  

347
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:35,519
the the cultivation the German cultivators they  say well we have a larger they have a larger stake  

348
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:43,759
in the market but but if if you start calculating  it it I would say it's in that region at least  

349
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:51,640
interesting absolutely fascinating um where by  where by German politicians who are looking into  

350
00:40:51,639 --> 00:41:00,079
the medical market for cannabis said why don't  we allow more cultivation of medical cannabis  

351
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:07,759
in Germany why do we really need to import it  from various different other other different  

352
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,920
countries like Canada and there number of other  countries right now exporting into the German  

353
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:20,599
Market yeah uh why can't we actually strengthen  the German medical cannabis industry which from  

354
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:27,960
my point of view is natural yeah let's do it we  have we we know that we can do it we we know that  

355
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:35,679
we have three cultivation uh companies who who  are really experts in it why don't we try to at  

356
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:45,119
least serve the market for medical uh Canabis at  least to a much higher extent from from German  

357
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:51,719
cultivation so does German do the prices of uh  we won't talk about quality that's a little bit  

358
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:59,480
subjective but we can quantify the prices quite  easily um you know the the argument that well the  

359
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:08,440
German cultivators will never be able to compete  in Germany with other uh foreign outsourcers like  

360
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:14,840
Colombia loto for example I've heard that argument  um I don't know what to think about it because I  

361
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:20,559
actually have no idea what the costs are I mean  you know you can you can grow uh cannabis for  

362
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:27,119
Less in some of these other countries but then  you still have all these other import costs and  

363
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:35,279
Customs cost and travel costs and or shipping cost  and and whatnot yeah what do you think about that  

364
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:44,800
well well at the point in time when the various uh  participants in that tender started to calculate  

365
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:53,080
uh what is a per gr price an appropriate per gram  price and I can say that we were representing one  

366
00:42:53,079 --> 00:43:00,639
of those cultivators who did not win uh uh and we  actually we sitting together and see what is the  

367
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:08,440
right price on a program basis which makes it at  least economically feasible uh and now we know and  

368
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:16,200
that's official that's public domain that uh the  per gram price from cultivation in Germany is 220  

369
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:23,239
so they are selling at 220 per gram two they're  selling it at 220 220 euro per gram to the B for  

370
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:27,479
oh is that right no that's interesting I didn't  know that so the they're obviously then their  

371
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:38,119
their their production costs are maybe we could  assume half like a Euro I I maybe we're getting  

372
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:45,719
into a little no that's that's precarious ground  yeah no that indeed because those um parties or  

373
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:53,879
those participants in the tender process they Rich  wanted to win it they they were significantly uh  

374
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:59,200
calculating it and at the very low and as  our client who did not win actually did it  

375
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:06,279
as well but it was still more than the 220 so the  question which you have to ask those licenses are  

376
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:13,640
you making money are you making money yes or no  which I can't answer uh and uh uh of course you  

377
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:20,679
know the uh setting up of a cultivation site uh  for medical cabis in Germany is expensive because  

378
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:24,799
you know the security millions and millions and  millions and millions the security measurements  

379
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:31,080
of course and and all infrastructure which you  need so so very difficult to say how much at  

380
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:38,199
least but this has to be amortized you know  and then of course you you're talking about  

381
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:43,919
a different price structure of course than 220 per  gram right for my point of view right uh but let's  

382
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:51,360
see how this works out uh U I believe that the  German cultivation cultivation sides the German  

383
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:57,800
cultivators definitely can compete with all the  others around the world uh from Canada uh from  

384
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:04,760
Holland from loto or for for whever because we  we don't have the respective transport costs you  

385
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:10,680
know handling is easier uh and and as such but  just what you said you know cost structures in  

386
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:19,199
Germany of course are higher with regard to energy  and and uh Labor uh and what what you also need  

387
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:29,559
is good management and amation can right uh but uh  sense you know if you going to to send uh a ton of  

388
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:37,719
Canabis from Canada to to Germany the respective  transport costs are significant you know uh 100%  

389
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:47,000
um well that's all extremely interesting stuff  Peter I think that uh uh uh I mean basically  

390
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,119
we have three major things happening we have the  a bunch of stuff with the can KNG we've got this  

391
00:45:53,119 --> 00:46:03,039
social or the um uh cultivation associations uh we  have um uh now what about seeds and clones I think  

392
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:08,159
a lot of people ask about that we hear seeds  and clones are going to become legal in some  

393
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:13,960
way can you speak to that yes they they need to  become legal in some way in which way is a little  

394
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:22,840
uncertain uh with respect to can you just uh order  it by amazone for your private cultivation uh at  

395
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:30,120
home I don't believe that's going to happen darn  it uh but what what what the German government is  

396
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:39,039
thinking is that the for for the home grow for the  growth or for the cultivation of um cannabis at  

397
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:44,800
home you can actually get your your seeds from  the Canabis associations from the cultivation

398
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:55,039
associations and even if you're not a member  you should actually be able to get your seeds  

399
00:46:55,039 --> 00:47:01,639
for hom growth from them so that's the plan from  this from the cultivation association yes that's  

400
00:47:01,639 --> 00:47:10,920
the plan so huh in indeed and we will see how  this will work out because the demand you know  

401
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:19,440
if if the LA would come into force on April  1st 2024 and you allow home grow the demand  

402
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:27,039
for seeds for cultivation equipment you know  is enormous enormous enormous enormous and  

403
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:33,360
the question is how can you serve that demand how  can you satisfy that demand and this is something  

404
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:38,840
which uh probably has not been re thought through  so far this is such an interesting conversation  

405
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:44,800
I think we're really teaching uh the folks our  audience so much about what's going on in Germany  

406
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:52,160
uh right now um Peter where would you say the  opportunities are industry opportunities with  

407
00:47:52,159 --> 00:48:00,119
this with KNG with phase one with even phase to  uh and with the medical uh with cannabis coming  

408
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:08,039
off the narcotics list I mean I think people can  can come to their own conclusion by uh deduce from  

409
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:14,039
uh everything you said uh thus far of maybe of  of of what some of those opportunities could be  

410
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:21,039
could you enumerate a few industry uh areas and  sectors that you think are going to uh benefit  

411
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:27,000
from this it will be definitely very positive I  wouldn't say a boost but very positive for the  

412
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,719
medical market for the medical cannabis Market  which is already the biggest which is Market in  

413
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:39,039
Europe it hasn't it hasn't been growing so fast  as everybody wanted it to grow or as as it has  

414
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:44,719
been predicted to grow but it's steadily growing  and there are some new ways for example now uh in  

415
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:52,519
order uh to bring together pharmacies Physicians  and and patients so there are some interesting uh  

416
00:48:52,519 --> 00:48:59,199
platforms who are doing that um so this Market  will definitely have a from my point of view  

417
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:06,839
positive impact from the new cannabis gazettes  home grow um or and the community cultivation as  

418
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:15,360
I would call it MH for for the existing cannabis  industry it's it's probably not that interesting  

419
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:21,280
except for those who are providing equipment  who are providing seeds uh who are providing  

420
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:28,600
uh knowledge uh who can advise uh those clubs how  to set up the respective infrastructure once we  

421
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:37,039
know how the infrastructure will look like from a  state $64,000 from a from from a state byst state  

422
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:47,000
regulation um and uh I think these are the the the  the winners I would say from that uh if the second  

423
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:53,679
stage is coming uh which we still haven't seen  as a draft law which was actually promised to be  

424
00:49:53,679 --> 00:50:03,399
uh at least put into the public by by end of by  end of 2023 uh then uh we probably will see more  

425
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:10,639
winners and from the existing cannabis industry  in Germany uh because you know if you have this  

426
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:17,440
uh pilot projects rolled out over Germany you  need to serve these pilot projects with with  

427
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,480
cannabis um which is probably which are probably  not the cultivation associations who are going to  

428
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:30,800
provide that so that it will be probably those uh  who are in a position and the three uh licensed  

429
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:36,880
medical cannabis cultivators are in the in the  top position for that for phase two for phase two  

430
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:42,880
yeah in in what regard that they would vertically  consolidate and have their own what well if you or  

431
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:48,519
they would oh I get it I get it that they would  Supply yes they will supply you know they can  

432
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:57,440
definitely uh extend the limited production which  they have right now under the 10 10 .4 metric tons  

433
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:04,920
for 4 years for the medical s they can definitely  uh serve the market increase their production and  

434
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:11,680
serve the market for uh for the pilot projects  so this sounds like when the that the phase to  

435
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:19,559
the pilot projects those are basically going to be  de facto dispensaries that when the EU capitulates  

436
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:27,119
if I will if I may um then those will be the the  establishments and institutions that uh one could  

437
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:34,239
foresee being grandfathered into a license and  and regulate uh yeah and with with those with  

438
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:39,919
those data which you can then generate and as  I said this is my favorite solution for the for  

439
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:45,320
the legalization process with those data which  you can generate from these uh scientifically  

440
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:51,280
controlled pilot projects you can actually Lobby  then uh before the European commission and within  

441
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:58,000
at the other member states for the legalization  on a broader basis um that's that's that makes  

442
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:05,079
sense um what about Brands Peter right now I'm  curious if you go to a pharmac I think people  

443
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:12,279
hear about Germany that cannabis is sold in the  pharmacies under medical um can that cannabis be  

444
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:20,519
branded can you when you go and buy a package  at the pharmacy does it have to be a a banan  

445
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:30,360
sterile package or could it say could it have a  like uh cookies on it or like the cookies brand  

446
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:37,120
with a low with a uh a brand can are there any  brands in the German pharmacies I'm curious well  

447
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:43,960
the question is what what is a brand if you mean  a logo and description description of the of the  

448
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:51,840
product well yes of course we we have of course  uh uh various Brands already in the in the German  

449
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:58,480
Market from various uh companies uh who are  importers who have maybe their own brand or  

450
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:04,679
using different brand bedan has different brands  for example as as Canam medical has different  

451
00:53:04,679 --> 00:53:11,199
brand brands for their products now when I say  brand I don't mean just the name of the strain  

452
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:19,039
necessarily could there be like a colorful sticker  with a the answer is no know it's a pharmaceutical  

453
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:23,599
it really remain a pharmaceutical and has to be  pharmaceutically packaged So when you say Brands  

454
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:30,799
that's like the strain name purush or this  is whatever yeah with with a specific of THC  

455
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:39,880
content CBD content Etc interesting Peter you are  down here in Slovenia uh to speak in front of the  

456
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:46,480
National Council which is basically our bundus  rat um you're speaking tomorrow uh in front of  

457
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:53,199
a packed house uh at the National Council we are  extremely glad to have you down here and giving  

458
00:53:53,199 --> 00:54:00,239
the uh Slovenian National Council your opinion  on things um do you want to just give us a a a  

459
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:07,679
little hint into what you're going to say or  maybe I could reframe the question and saying  

460
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:15,399
what do you think a country like Slovenia should  do at this stage um um um what should they take  

461
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:20,800
from Germany what should they uh not take uh  what are you going to talk about tomorrow what  

462
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,360
do you suggest Slovenia what do you suggest  Slovenia does well first of all I think it's  

463
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:31,360
a big advantage that other countries are looking  into the possibility to use cannabis first of all  

464
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:36,720
for medical purposes but also thinking about the  legalization process like Czech Republic is doing  

465
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:43,480
it as well uh uh I think that's a big step forward  Slovenia has always been very cautious looking at  

466
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:49,480
what's going to happen in other European member  states uh and as such I will definitely report  

467
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:55,840
about what I believe is a real success about the  medical market for cannabis and Germany MH uh and  

468
00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:01,960
show the developments show the the numbers which  we have for patients the quantities and of course  

469
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:09,280
also discuss uh a little bit uh whether would it  be better to have uh local production rather than  

470
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:17,320
import uh or is it better to use the already  uh established roots of importation so that's  

471
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:25,680
I think one one piece of my my presentation  tomorrow uh and uh my for my personal point  

472
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:37,599
of view uh cannabis is uh a real good addition to  the possibilities uh for different different uh uh  

473
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:42,559
for the treatment of different diseases you know  if you look into chronic pain and what cannabis  

474
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:51,400
can do for those patients uh who are using other  uh um medications which have probably more side  

475
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:58,119
effects or not well uh but who who are are  looking for a different treatment I think  

476
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:03,960
Canabis is a very good alternative and as such it  has definitely its place from my point of view in  

477
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:09,240
the Pharmaceuticals market so that's number one  number two of course then we're talking about  

478
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:15,679
the recreational Market uh and from my point  of view I will uh definitely point out that uh  

479
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:22,199
the scientific uh controlled pilot project from  my point of view is the best step forward look  

480
00:56:22,199 --> 00:56:30,039
into what uh first of all controlled cultivation  controlled distribution and of course then gaining  

481
00:56:30,039 --> 00:56:38,119
data uh getting uh really knowledge uh What uh  uh cannabis for recreation purposes can do uh and  

482
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:46,039
then actually decide what how how a legalization  process can go forward that is amazing Peter  

483
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:51,320
Holberg the man the myth the legend we are so  honored to have you in Slovenia and speaking
