having weed I suppose uh to discuss the

5
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:21,278
Cannabis cultivation technology

6
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:25,518
Revolution right Cutting Edge technology

7
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:27,198
uh that is elevating Global cultivation

8
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:28,639
operations I'm this I'm this many years

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,480
old I don't know how old you guys are

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,600
but I'm I'm this will I look at things

to lead us off uh the managing partner

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,039
for cultivators let's hear it for sunny

13
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:42,479
Marin out did I get close Mor out you're

14

actually Four great guys with me in the

18
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,320
panel to Deep dive into cultivation I

19
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,238
think we had a lot of panels today but I

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,439
think this is I like this one the most

21
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:03,599
diving into the cultivation techn

commissioning and um supporting them in

82
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,760
all the the growing facilities so taking

83
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:41,318
this to the topic of the the panel um

84
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:44,239
maybe starting with you France what are

85
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:46,479
the latest cultivation techniques um

86
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,319
Innovations you've seen at customers you

87
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,238
visited what are some highlights you

88
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,878
want to show to everybody

89
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,200
here yeah I mean difficult where to

90
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:58,078
start since you know I started

91
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:01,560
cultivating we obviously went with the

92
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:05,400
metal hit uh veg and then with the HPS

93
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,519
for flour um I would say now for over

94
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,480
the last 6 seven years we see very

95
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,438
advanced LED technology where we can

96
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:15,518
ramp up uh with more light intensity get

97
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,439
more yield per square

98
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,000
meter uh in the latest years what we see

99
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:24,079
is the under or ICL you know inter

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
canopy lighting shifting uh light

101
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:31,599
intensities from 100% top light to 75%

102
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,560
top light or or even down to 60% top

103
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,520
light and 40% Lighting in between the

104
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,879
plants um that's coming from commercial

105
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:43,279
agriculture but uh we have tested it and

106
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,680
it's all over the internet at the moment

107
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,000
with other companies also uh getting

108
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,519
into that

109
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,439
space uh yeah we see a lot of benefits

110
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:56,240
in that shifting especially the

111
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:58,759
different grades ABC to only a grade or

112
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,800
uh having very few b-grade and that's

113
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:03,800
very valuable for the pharmaceutical

114
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,720
Market yeah and Jeremy what what you

115
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,038
have seen other than light as

116
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,560
Innovations in the in the growing

117
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:11,680
facilities what are some key things you

118
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,879
think okay my Growers really need to

119
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,000
have this in the facility we're seeing a

120
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:19,079
lot more sensor integration and uh ways

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,720
to collect data because if we don't know

122
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,159
what's going on inside of our media

123
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,560
substrate whatever it is then obviously

124
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,800
we don't know we only can take guesses

125
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,280
it's only a guessing game and with all

126
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,680
the advance advancements

127
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:37,279
technology in the as far as on-site

128
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:41,120
testing or water content you know water

129
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:43,318
meter Water Analysis um crop

130
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,199
steering there's so many different ways

131
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,479
to kind of break that one down and get

132
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,919
into that one it's a really really long

133
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:53,680
big uh it's a it's a fun subject so data

134
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:54,799
data collection sap analysis is another

135
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,800
one you know we need to know what's

136
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,400
going on inside of our plants we can't

137
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,560
just guess it's uh like doing blood work

138
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:03,959
so so we need to know what's happening

139
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,959
all the at all times we can't just look

140
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:08,839
at pictures because we have these books

141
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:12,758
sorry we have these books right and it

142
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:14,439
gives you 15 different possibilities for

143
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:17,800
what could be going wrong is it a cowm

144
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:19,959
MAG problem is it a nitrogen issue yeah

145
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,038
that's um from pictures you cannot see

146
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:23,359
it you need to dive into the subject but

147
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:27,360
yeah data collection that connects

148
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,240
really well to what you are doing uh Rob

149
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,840
yeah I I couldn't agree more about thata

150
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,439
selection or data uh focus and Gathering

151
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:38,038
I mean I I think that's a a huge topic

152
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,839
and a huge Focus right now and uh I

153
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:43,038
remember at the beginning of of uh you

154
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:45,679
know legalization the medical Market in

155
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:47,240
in Canada I mean you know you could I

156
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,680
mean you could put up four walls and

157
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,680
throw a bunch of seeds on the ground

158
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,959
like Jack and the beanock and and weed

159
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,598
would grow and you could sell it at a

160
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,000
high price and you know everyone made a

161
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,759
fortune everybody loved it um you know

162
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,199
but the market has become more

163
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,319
competitive uh you know lots of entrance

164
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,000
you know for people here who have

165
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,759
watched the Canadian Market a lot of

166
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,800
people have been exiting it uh less now

167
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,680
but you know over the past couple years

168
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:14,478
we we saw a lot of that so discussions

169
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,840
now are a lot around uh margins and you

170
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:19,199
know efficiency of effort and you know

171
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:22,758
parsimony when it comes to to expending

172
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,879
resources and and you need really data

173
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,360
to to make those decisions to to

174
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,120
understand that you're you're focusing

175
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,960
your resources in the right place and

176
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,240
you're you're you're doing it

177
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:33,839
efficiently and you're you're getting

178
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,439
the most most bang for for every dollar

179
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,918
that you're you're putting in cuz it you

180
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,319
know it it has in certain jurisdictions

181
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:43,959
it does become a very competitive

182
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,919
industry and yeah you need to focus yeah

183
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:48,079
and for you mik what have you seen

184
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:50,120
around the the latest year in new

185
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,598
Innovations in

186
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,120
cultivation yeah I mean look you know

187
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:57,439
cannabis is a it's a it's a medical it's

188
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,199
a it's a medicine it's food it's it's a

189
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,158
it's a high value crop and uh it's also

190
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:05,598
extremely important to to grow it

191
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:09,079
consistent consistently and repeatedly

192
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:12,839
uh from grow to grow and and uh every

193
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:15,079
time you you grow that strain so we see

194
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,119
the move towards really Master recipes

195
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:19,279
and uh taking Master recipes and that

196
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,319
includes not only you know the energy

197
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:22,638
that you're delivering to the to the

198
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:25,080
lights for the strain that you're

199
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,840
growing but then also ensuring that the

200
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:28,800
environment is identical to what you did

201
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,478
last time and marrying that to the to

202
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,360
the fertigation and the recipe that's

203
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,319
driven in there and so as you look to to

204
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,839
drive really Master recipes you want to

205
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:41,200
be able to set up and and develop a a uh

206
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,279
a facility or an application where you

207
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,879
can you can input and uh when you set up

208
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:47,958
the room you set up the strain you set

209
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:50,958
up what you're doing you're delivering

210
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:53,479
exactly repeatedly uh the same exact

211
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,559
recipe and information on and direction

212
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,759
to to the equipment and the process

213
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:59,919
that's being grown so that the outcome

214
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,360
is uh repeatable to the last time you

215
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,879
grew that strain and then through

216
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,480
analytics you're able to analyze that

217
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:08,799
and uh do comparative um not only

218
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,639
testing but uh comparative uh analytics

219
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,559
to to see where where things could be

220
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:15,639
improved as you continue to improve that

221
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:18,199
Master recipe yeah I think it's um

222
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:20,360
important Point irrigation fertigation

223
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,800
and um following what's happening in the

224
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,600
root Zone and based on that making

225
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:27,120
informed decisions how to adapt your

226
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,399
strategy also with the type of light or

227
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,120
how much light you have you really need

228
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,600
to adapt that of course

229
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,480
um that brings me also to another topic

230
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,079
you guys brought up to talk about is

231
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,399
advancements in irrigation and

232
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:44,159
fertigation Jeremy what are core things

233
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:47,440
you're looking at um mainly I mean again

234
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:50,078
back to the data collection so uh

235
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,040
and tongue twister and actually the

236
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:55,519
pulse feeding and accuracy of the

237
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,439
nutrient delivery to the plant that's a

238
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,120
big deal because when you start talking

239
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,560
about direct injection systems a lot of

240
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,600
them kind of just um they're not that

241
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:07,919
depending on the kind of parastic you

242
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,040
know the quality of pump or I don't want

243
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,519
to get go down a rabbit hole but you

244
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:13,439
know when you have venturies for

245
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,639
instance it can tend to be a little bit

246
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,760
less accurate most of the time um so

247
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:22,600
many machines there are many we don't

248
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:24,838
need just have to say one specific but

249
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,639
um you understand we need pressure

250
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,320
compensated drippers and also checking

251
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,919
it

252
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,800
with Friday night checking do we get in

253
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,199
out of every dripper the same amount of

254
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,838
water and it's it's very important to

255
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,320
understand there are those two terms

256
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,880
vegetative steering generative steering

257
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,959
around uh in the end it's about the dry

258
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,559
bags right and the irrigation uh the

259
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:49,679
frequency of the

260
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:51,638
irrigation understanding what your root

261
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,399
Zone and your plants need and then you

262
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:56,360
will be able to steer it in the right

263
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:58,440
ways um obviously on that behalf you

264
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,278
need to have the right equipment uh we

265
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,560
see irrig on rock wool up to 12 times

266
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:06,679
per day is is uh yeah it's actually how

267
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:10,159
it should be maybe even more who knows

268
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:12,638
sometimes yeah on the too dry but that's

269
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,679
also that fits in perfect with those

270
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,839
High light intensity approaches that we

271
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:19,399
see now or the photo acclimation as we

272
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:23,079
like to call it where we ramp up the

273
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:26,200
light intensity um obviously getting the

274
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:28,479
plant used to it step by step day by day

275
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,839
and in the end uh we can really we see

276
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,879
results 1 kilog per square meter is

277
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:39,040
definitely possible uh under one fixture

278
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:41,159
that's 1.2 * 1.2 you get up to 1.5 kg

279
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:44,159
but that's literally when you have all

280
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:46,360
the correlations in check and yeah most

281
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:49,759
importantly lighting

282
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:52,480
fertigation and that the rest is water

283
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,000
quality how about um Nano bubbles I mean

284
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,039
that's another big one we're starting to

285
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,919
get invol we're starting to see a lot

286
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:02,240
more dissolved oxygen implemented into

287
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:05,439
the C cultivations and even some uh

288
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,560
water treatment with ozone yeah that's

289
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,120
plasma plasma technology is another new

290
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:11,599
one sorry to cut you off no worries but

291
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,959
yeah nanobubbles is maybe a great

292
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,159
example it's something um which is

293
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:18,239
necessary if you have like an low

294
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,000
quality substrate and your oxygen levels

295
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,480
are low but I hear you talking about

296
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,958
growing in rock Stonewall if you have

297
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,079
good water temperature you will never

298
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:28,879
have issues uh with oxygen level so is

299
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:30,439
then Nano bus necessary that's then the

300
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,360
question of course depending on your

301
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,480
starting Quality Water Well I have an

302
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,320
interesting one um in our Greenhouse in

303
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,120
North Las Vegas that I manage uh we have

304
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:44,000
never had chillers so we had a really

305
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,839
bad fer ferium outbreak and once we

306
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,958
implemented dissolved oxygen not only

307
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:54,680
did our LG problems go away um

308
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:58,078
we um not only did our algae problems go

309
00:12:54,679 --> 00:13:00,120
away but we managed to increase the

310
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:04,000
obviously the yield but the nutrient up

311
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:06,360
tank the um metabolism of the plants

312
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,360
obviously are increasing and the overall

313
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,399
orps dropping too so you're not your

314
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,680
system's going to be a lot cleaner but

315
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,799
but the key thing from that that's where

316
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:19,120
I was going with that I went off um some

317
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,599
of our water was getting up to like 90°

318
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,480
and we still weren't losing plants

319
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:27,040
because of the high oxygen content so

320
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:30,000
there's some cool benefits that uh that

321
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,759
come along with that yeah

322
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,240
yeah and I I I think all of those

323
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,439
Technologies and I think it just comes

324
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,600
back to also knowing what's there and

325
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,480
really monitoring I mean I I think comes

326
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,879
back to data and if you see all the

327
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,440
different interactions of all those

328
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,879
things and not to you

329
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,720
know you know Ai and all these things

330
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:49,198
people talking about but these are the

331
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,839
things that if the data is collected

332
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,078
then at some point you can start to

333
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:55,040
analyze that and and and really assess

334
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:57,039
what's happening in in better in real

335
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,360
time so I think that you know there's a

336
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,519
there's there's a lot of advancements

337
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,639
there that that's coming but data is

338
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,600
data is important data is key your your

339
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,839
outputs are a direct result of your

340
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,199
inputs and if you can monitor all that

341
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,440
and map it and go back and reflect on it

342
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:14,159
and see the charts or where your issues

343
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,440
started it's definitely a a big

344
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,958
Advantage yeah everything needs to uh be

345
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,759
in balance for optimal plant growing

346
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,159
let's dive into another whole topic

347
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:26,079
actually energy conservation if we look

348
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:29,559
to the global uh situation Energy prices

349
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:32,559
it's an all topic um what do strategies

350
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:35,599
to maximize yields while actually uh

351
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:39,000
without uh compromising the growing

352
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:42,159
operations but getting uh yeah needing

353
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,720
less energy for your growing facility um

354
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:45,480
as an example with the research

355
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:49,079
institute that you're also involved with

356
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,800
France we are looking into uh a crop

357
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:53,599
growing a cannabis crop without any

358
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:57,039
vetch period that can really reduce your

359
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,720
energy consumption by 40 50% easily just

360
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:02,360
very short note on that um

361
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,600
in Austria where many people grow a lot

362
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:08,879
wheat at home also um we don't really

363
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,759
have time to spend uh veg you know and

364
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:14,639
one week of veg is one and a half weeks

365
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,120
of flowering time so sometimes I look at

366
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,919
some Growers and they tell me it's like

367
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,120
four weeks of veg and I'm like yeah I

368
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,919
see those humongous trees that you have

369
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,799
but bro that six weeks of flowering you

370
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:28,439
know if you profits exactly um so long

371
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:31,439
story short it comes from a necessity

372
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,600
right to have no veg obviously need to

373
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,639
increase the plant density per square

374
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,120
meter uh ramp up light intensity got to

375
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,680
be fast you know it's it's you need to

376
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,440
understand the correlations but then you

377
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:45,479
can save time get more yield and having

378
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,120
the right genetic who can cope with it

379
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,800
of course 100% don't do that with Stumpy

380
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:53,839
small indicas do that with stretchy

381
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:55,879
hybrids that fill up your canopy yeah

382
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,560
Rob going to what you're doing with grow

383
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:00,000
IQ is that uh the energy topic is that

384
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:01,518
something coming back to you guys as

385
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,480
well what you you're doing and

386
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,360
developing well to some extent probably

387
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,839
not as much as some of the other other

388
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,399
people on the panel but uh but it does

389
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:13,199
come back to yeah Gathering data

390
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,399
understanding the data understanding

391
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:18,000
what's what's happened to the history of

392
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:21,159
your your batches and plants that you've

393
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,399
growing I mean we we do uh some

394
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:26,838
forecasting in in grower IQ of of what

395
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,519
yield will look like under certain

396
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:31,839
conditions and once we we have some

397
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:34,440
historic iCal data on on what's gone

398
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,959
into these batches we can we can get

399
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,639
really close to what a dry yield will be

400
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,359
you know at the at the end of a batch

401
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,039
and you know different factors that go

402
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,039
in will but is that you say forecasting

403
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,159
the yield but do you also have models

404
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:49,559
already to forecast the energy usage

405
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:51,759
well well that that gets gets Associated

406
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:53,359
right I mean uh you know you can you can

407
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,839
play around a little bit with what the

408
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,360
inputs are you know and and try to lower

409
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,720
that energy input and see what your your

410
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,480
yield forecast will be in in the future

411
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,558
right and and so so yeah in a in a in a

412
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,599
roundabout way it does get to it because

413
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:11,639
then you can minimize some of your

414
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:15,480
inputs to maximize some of your your

415
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:19,120
outputs stretch it out yeah

416
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,880
M um yeah so power and uh energy is

417
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,639
something to happen to know a little bit

418
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,319
about and uh and that's primarily with

419
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,880
with what we do with uh with smart power

420
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,159
um but it's really being intentional

421
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,039
about what energy you use specifically

422
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,360
for the crop you're being grown and by

423
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:36,440
being able to use you know smart power

424
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:38,079
distributed power outside of outside

425
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,240
your centralized in your facility you

426
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:44,079
can deliver the exact energy to to to

427
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,079
the specific you know light or uh that's

428
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:48,839
being over the specific strain that's

429
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,678
being grown and through that um through

430
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:52,038
that you can start to bring really crop

431
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:54,679
steering through lighting to match your

432
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:58,038
fertigation and and start to even save

433
00:17:54,679 --> 00:18:00,120
another 20% in energy um just by being

434
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:01,359
optimized in and exactly the amount of

435
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:03,359
energy that you're delivering to that

436
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,879
fixture that's over that strain that's

437
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:06,279
in that particular room and that's

438
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,880
that's huge and when you couple that

439
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:10,839
with you know saving uh on on the veg

440
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,640
time and everything else but you know

441
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:15,279
energy in in Europe and around the world

442
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,960
is uh is huge and being able to monitor

443
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,279
that and then understand exactly how

444
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,798
much energy you're going to use in a

445
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,319
particular

446
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:25,639
um in a particular cycle um can save

447
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,200
significant the other thing that you can

448
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,640
start to do with with with Smart Energy

449
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,319
and smart hours you can start to analyze

450
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,240
and get feedback from the grid so if

451
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,000
there are you know rolling back outs or

452
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,120
other things that are happening or you

453
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,480
know Peak demand you can actually shave

454
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:42,678
even if it's a couple percent down you

455
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,319
can you can save significant energy by

456
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:46,600
you know penalties from from being

457
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,798
implant implemented and uh without

458
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:51,399
affecting what you're

459
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:53,558
doing yeah if you talk about uh growing

460
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,200
medicinal cannabis in general everybody

461
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:57,079
really talks about consistency

462
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,679
uniformity of the end product you need

463
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:02,199
to have what is uh for you guys some key

464
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,159
elements in the cultivation will really

465
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,000
have a

466
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:09,600
big role in getting consistency and

467
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,880
uniformity Jeremy what honestly I think

468
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:14,399
a good control system you know that's a

469
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,440
difficult thing to find sometimes to

470
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,880
make everything line up together

471
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,400
especially when you piece some of these

472
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,400
pie ese especially when you bring some

473
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,919
of these elements together you might not

474
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,280
have the same fertigation skid as you

475
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:30,600
know the same manufacturer as the HVAC

476
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:32,158
you know Cooling and uh you know for

477
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:35,719
instance you might have a priva system

478
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:39,400
or a um what do we say

479
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,798
priva whatever any of the Argus and you

480
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,000
might want to choose a different

481
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:45,679
fertigation skid from a a different

482
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,960
company and and

483
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,679
uh that's a big big deal if you don't

484
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,159
have control of your all of your inputs

485
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,360
again it's going to be a a lesser result

486
00:19:55,159 --> 00:20:01,440
of your outputs and you have to be able

487
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:03,279
to maximize your grams per square foot

488
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,120
or per per meter however you're looking

489
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:08,879
at it whatever country you're in but um

490
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:11,119
we try and focus on a lot of

491
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,880
uniformity and uniformity is going to

492
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:15,759
deliver your most grams per square meter

493
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,480
foot you know like we're talking about

494
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:21,558
and at the end of the day a gram I mean

495
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,558
a Watts a watt and a BTU is a BTU so if

496
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:26,240
you maximize your yield that's going to

497
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,200
really balance that out at the end of

498
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,359
the

499
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:34,120
day one thing because it seems like we

500
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:36,639
are very Tech panel it always comes down

501
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:39,119
to the person that's heading your grow

502
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:43,520
so humans don't get lost in the sauce

503
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:45,279
it's still about us um and also AI you

504
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:48,200
know in the end we all need the track

505
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:50,319
and Trace and also have the data

506
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,240
collected become better in the medical

507
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:56,319
cannabis in the streets called uh

508
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,400
cultivar validation we we validate The

509
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:00,240
Strain right in the best case you have

510
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,240
an knowledgeable grower he understands

511
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,400
the strain he understands the linage the

512
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,480
genetics and he more or less knows how

513
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:11,480
to grow it so within three grows where

514
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,960
he is uh within the plusus 10% he will

515
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,079
understand how to cultivate it um and

516
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,319
that's that's key right it's it's always

517
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:20,000
down to the persons it's a funny thing

518
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,519
with you were mentioning also with uh

519
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,119
the growing and influence on the final

520
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:26,879
product uniformity um what is then also

521
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:28,798
important have the right lab to test it

522
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,320
lately I was with a a grower and they

523
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:33,240
were a bit in the they said they were

524
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:34,759
scared that they were not doing it right

525
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,278
because they suddenly had a couple

526
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:40,200
percent less uh TC in the in the flower

527
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:42,278
and they said yeah yeah cultivation blah

528
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,759
blah blah but in the end I said yeah

529
00:21:42,278 --> 00:21:46,960
please recheck with the lab if the

530
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:48,879
testing is done correctly and where was

531
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,640
the mistake in

532
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,039
there can also be validated wrong the

533
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,720
testing methods

534
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:57,519
yeah getting standardized is a really

535
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,640
big thing that we need to try and band

536
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:03,000
together on on a Global you know on a

537
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,440
Global Network that that actually brings

538
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,960
you also to Europe how you're connecting

539
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,720
um lab testing to what you guys are

540
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:13,600
doing yeah uh it comes down to you know

541
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,679
as you were saying earlier tracking and

542
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:19,639
data and uh being able to record what

543
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:22,640
the the Finish result is uh you know in

544
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,559
your coas that you're getting and uh and

545
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,480
being able to go back and and even with

546
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:29,079
the same grower uh you know who's who's

547
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,919
managing the grow I mean I mean

548
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:34,079
ultimately there's there's often a big

549
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:36,559
team and you know the The Growers going

550
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,639
through you know dozens of batches and

551
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:41,119
you know time goes by they're busy you

552
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,400
know if uh sometimes people will have a

553
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,678
a great yield and you know the next one

554
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,759
is a little off and with good tracking

555
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:51,240
they can go back and and see you know oh

556
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:53,720
you know I added extra this that time

557
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:57,319
and and got a bit better of of a yield

558
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,720
out of it so if I'd like to just add

559
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:00,639
that you know we talk about the

560
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,798
important things of of of data and

561
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,200
tracking and and testing and these

562
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,558
things but we see a lot too that the

563
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,038
design of the facility from the

564
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,960
beginning is also critical and so many

565
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:13,319
times it's a rush to build and a rush to

566
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,360
get started and it's like I I'll worry

567
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:19,798
about those things later but really you

568
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:21,719
you will save so much time and countless

569
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,960
times we talked to uh Growers that you

570
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,798
know their first build they're just

571
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,400
ripping it down and starting over um and

572
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:29,918
you know redoing it or abandoning

573
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:33,038
different sections so really plan your

574
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,159
design design the facility uh look at

575
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,000
all of the systems make sure they can

576
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,480
integrate together regardless of what

577
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,599
you're using but you know from the

578
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,480
fertigation to the lighting to the you

579
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:45,199
know to the sensors to everything is

580
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,120
integrated and and can deliver the crop

581
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,558
and and the and plan what you want to

582
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:51,038
grow and how you want to grow and really

583
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:53,038
the output that you need and plan that

584
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:55,200
through so that when you start to grow

585
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:57,278
you can meet and Achieve that and and

586
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,679
and that that a lot of times is we all

587
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:00,640
want to get to the output but when you

588
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,679
talk about medical and repeatability

589
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,559
it's having that integrated and that

590
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:07,120
design really thought through up front

591
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:10,038
that's going to give you the outcome you

592
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:12,359
want consistency yeah I think that's a

593
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:14,278
really important topic design of the

594
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:16,798
facility and do it in the right way so

595
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:18,519
that you're also ready for the future

596
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:21,319
that actually brings me also to another

597
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:23,519
topic um asking you guys what will be

598
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:28,079
for you the growing facility of the

599
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,079
future how would it look like

600
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:32,440
I'm building the growing facility the

601
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:35,440
future right now fortunately I have my

602
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,240
dream grow I got really uh lucky and

603
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,038
we're building one in Costa Rica we have

604
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:43,880
a biochar facility so it'll be carbon

605
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:45,679
negative and we're taking um the waste

606
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,360
from sugar cane and we're turning it

607
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:51,960
into biochar and that's we're going to

608
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:53,678
generate 110 megaw and we don't need all

609
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,278
that power so we'll sell it back to the

610
00:24:53,679 --> 00:25:00,240
grid and um and then we'll be

611
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:02,679
cultivating our upon as well so we're

612
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,519
going to be pretty clean and uh we won't

613
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:06,440
be carbon negative on the cultivation

614
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:09,278
side but we'll be carbon neutral and

615
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:12,798
carbon negative on the power generation

616
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:14,480
side so that's kind of a cool one it's

617
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:16,599
new you know it's really hard to get

618
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,519
free Power and clean power into our

619
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:20,959
cultivations it usually takes so much by

620
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:23,319
the time it gets to us and it's not that

621
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,759
clean or green so yeah globally there

622
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:26,599
are more projects also in the vegetable

623
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:28,879
industry right they connected to things

624
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:30,240
like you're just mentioning so is is not

625
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,960
completely new but in the Cannabis not

626
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,359
seen often so right exactly but it's one

627
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,000
you know it's just a dream it's cool to

628
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:38,199
connect all the dots together and to be

629
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,398
able to bring it into the Cannabis world

630
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,000
and give back you know to the

631
00:25:39,398 --> 00:25:43,239
environment at the same time so it's

632
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,119
cool yeah such designs Jeremy are

633
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,159
definitely the future we see that also

634
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:50,119
in South Africa we have a customer

635
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:53,679
that's CO2 neutral they have their own

636
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:57,678
the First floating solar on the dam and

637
00:25:53,679 --> 00:26:01,278
um yeah very very nice uh futuristic

638
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:03,919
designs basically in for me personally

639
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:06,880
my personal opinion I would like to see

640
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:10,159
medical cannabis being grown controlled

641
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,360
indoors you know really because I'm also

642
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,399
an asthma patient you know if I smoke

643
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:16,558
cannabis from a greenhouse I'll be

644
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:19,079
coughing and not sleeping the whole

645
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:21,200
night um so for me it definitely needs

646
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:24,359
to be super clean and I would like it to

647
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,120
be craft cannabis obviously we have all

648
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:28,719
smoke cannabis from a greenhouse or

649
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:30,599
outdoor it works it does the job but for

650
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,960
the pharmaceutical part there is more to

651
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:39,480
it um and yeah for extracts I think we

652
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:42,840
could go greenhouse and outdoor you know

653
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:46,360
um but yeah for from a technology point

654
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:48,558
of view I think light uh deliver light

655
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:52,038
also in between the plants you know

656
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:54,879
really apply more efficient uh the

657
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:58,720
Technologies also irrigation you know

658
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:01,039
there are some mediums um rock cool

659
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:05,600
Alternatives that hold water for a

660
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:07,919
longer time may be more uh self

661
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,959
sustainable in the end you know so let's

662
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:14,799
see what the future holds we know where

663
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:15,679
comeg is heading or comeg went uh yeah

664
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:19,200
let's

665
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:21,038
see I I would say uh I mean those are

666
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,919
those are good points I would say I'd

667
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:27,798
throw uh AI on top of that as well um

668
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:30,159
it's uh you know it's moving pretty fast

669
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:32,240
it it does some some amazing stuff right

670
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,278
now and I think we're just uh really at

671
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,519
the tip of the iceberg in terms of how

672
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:38,599
we're we're going to be able to

673
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:41,079
incorporate it uh we're we're playing

674
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:43,398
around we we recently released a a

675
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:45,839
module actually that incorporates I

676
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:47,439
presented to a few uh quality people and

677
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:50,079
uh some of them loved it a couple were

678
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,759
worried about their role I think but uh

679
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:53,960
it's you know in reality I think it's

680
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,558
something that that will enhance it and

681
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,919
you know right now it's just pushing out

682
00:27:55,558 --> 00:28:02,200
to cover cover functional issues right

683
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:05,840
and and you know an example is uh like

684
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:09,120
uh you can you can train the AI on your

685
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:10,759
internal facility company Sops so that

686
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:14,000
lay people can go in and they can say

687
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:16,440
you know oh what uh what do I do after I

688
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,319
I put simud on the Clone and it'll come

689
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,640
back and give you a a lay person's

690
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:23,678
answer next step it it also TR uh puts

691
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:27,399
training programs together and you can

692
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:30,600
actually have uh courses presented by

693
00:28:27,398 --> 00:28:33,518
video AI die so really it eliminates the

694
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:35,480
entire need to you know for someone to

695
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:37,919
put sop training courses together and

696
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,240
and deliver them it it's all done

697
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,679
digitally which is a huge productivity

698
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,880
and and and savings for for a facility

699
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,600
and you know really that's again the tip

700
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,320
of the iceberg I mean there there are so

701
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:50,398
many functional areas that can be

702
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:53,200
addressed and then the next step after

703
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:56,158
that becomes uh more the decision-

704
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,640
making capacity that that can be done so

705
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,640
it's I think there's going to be a lot

706
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:03,840
of stuff around that in the future yeah

707
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,440
we'll see how that uh continues what can

708
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:08,639
be incorporated easily regarding AI into

709
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,759
cultivation maybe let's uh go to the

710
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,278
audience and see if there are some

711
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:15,759
cultivation questions uh for the pan

712
00:29:12,278 --> 00:29:19,798
panel members here yes let's go to the

713
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:19,798
audience there he is there he

714
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:25,440
is are there cultivation questions for

715
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,278
the audience here looks looks like not

716
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,720
many looks like you've explained it all

717
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:32,240
very well to them that they completely

718
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,079
fully educated maybe no Growers or they

719
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,960
had a bunch of Edibles at lunch and they

720
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:39,519
just kicked in one thing I'd say is uh

721
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,519
to to add to the conversation is you

722
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:44,798
know when you look at uh I think the

723
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:47,079
Cannabis industry um there's a lot of uh

724
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:50,519
excitement and you know many times

725
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:52,199
trying to uh in invent things from the

726
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:53,640
beginning but you know I think the the

727
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,960
the whole cultivation and the whole

728
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:59,120
industry can uh can make a difference in

729
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,960
talking about the future of cultivation

730
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,199
and Facilities but if we look to the

731
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,360
left and to the right there's a lot of

732
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,080
industries that are extremely efficient

733
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:08,398
and using a lot of Technology whether

734
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:10,798
it's in other crops or other

735
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:13,439
manufacturing sectors and there are

736
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:15,759
significant uh technologies that could

737
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,798
easily be adopted and and potentially

738
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:20,158
have a lot of applicability to not only

739
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:22,679
manufacturing but cultivation energy and

740
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,519
power especially there's significant you

741
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:27,559
know Global factories that are that are

742
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:28,919
carbon neutral you know CO2 um when you

743
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:30,678
talk about smart power and really

744
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:33,159
delivering and living on the grid and

745
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:35,720
just being really uh you know integrated

746
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:37,760
in but I think there's a lot of sectors

747
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,159
that sometimes we we close our eyes but

748
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:40,759
if we look look to the left and right

749
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:42,760
there's a lot of technology in the

750
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:44,960
indust in other industries that can

751
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:47,319
really help the the the cultivation

752
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,880
facility of the future there's a

753
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:50,079
question there's a microphone up here

754
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,519
behind you

755
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:55,960
s thank you so much

756
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:59,038
I and and I'm the shortest person to

757
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:02,679
get um my my question is actually

758
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:05,398
related to that um because we all talk

759
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:08,120
about technology and growing cultivation

760
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:11,719
uh integration and whatnot but one thing

761
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:14,479
that I foresee is that uh uh at this

762
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:17,278
point one of the struggles that I see is

763
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,200
most of that technology depends on

764
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:23,720
scale and I would like your perspective

765
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:27,120
on the fact that for example Germany

766
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:30,000
currently is discussing a type of model

767
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,839
that is very very low scale small scale

768
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,798
compared to the technology that we are

769
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:37,558
talking about that often depend on big

770
00:31:33,798 --> 00:31:39,558
scales to actually be uh balanced out on

771
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:42,200
price cost efficiency and what not that

772
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:44,480
you guys were discussing my concern on

773
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,558
that is also on what is your view

774
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,639
because European Union is looking at

775
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:51,278
this example and many of these examples

776
00:31:48,638 --> 00:31:53,319
on how to move forward and the scale

777
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:55,679
matters in all of this in all other

778
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:57,119
articulture uh uh sides mattered so I

779
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,679
would like your perspective on that how

780
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:02,319
do you see this being integrated in

781
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:04,399
smaller scales I I'll jump in uh just

782
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:05,879
because uh you know we we looked at

783
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:08,319
we're looking at that same model but

784
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,639
with with our uh you know Harvest Pro

785
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:13,278
container systems but we look at it as a

786
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:15,798
modularity and while while there is

787
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:17,519
scale to it I think if you break on

788
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:20,599
anything if you can break down the

789
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,200
systems um and you know the application

790
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:24,480
and what's being done and and take

791
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,319
things and modularize it then you can

792
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,480
easily scale it from you know whether

793
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:31,519
it's a container to a room to multiple

794
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,159
rooms to a facility um and and maybe

795
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,638
there are limits to some of the large

796
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:37,240
scale uh you know technology and you

797
00:32:35,638 --> 00:32:40,599
know power plants that might come into

798
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,839
the into the into the conversation but I

799
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:45,319
think if you're able to look at at at

800
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:47,079
technology and really modularize the

801
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:49,798
systems and and application of what

802
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:52,240
you're doing then you can you can slim

803
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:56,079
it down and also expand it out and and

804
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,079
with uh with with great

805
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:01,638
success uh no a really good question I'd

806
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,200
say there's there's probably a a

807
00:33:01,638 --> 00:33:05,918
business case for all these different

808
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,440
technologies that can be looked at uh in

809
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,360
the context of of different different

810
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,519
scale right and and some of them will

811
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:15,479
make sense and and some of them might

812
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:17,880
not but in the case of a small operation

813
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,720
sometimes it even makes more sense to to

814
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,480
implement certain types of Technology

815
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,278
just because the percentage savings

816
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,079
you're getting out of it is is so much

817
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:29,519
higher right if you can run a facility

818
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:31,879
off of three people versus versus five I

819
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,960
mean percentage wise that's that's a lot

820
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:37,399
of Labor savings that that you can you

821
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,200
can approach so I I think it comes down

822
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:41,319
to the type of technology and the the

823
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,480
business case and then uh as people were

824
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:46,200
saying you know adjusting you know and

825
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,360
maybe putting together an offering

826
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,720
that's appropriate for that for that

827
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:52,240
size and scale but yeah it was a really

828
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,919
good

829
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:58,558
question um what we see or what I see is

830
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,679
um now in the planning of Social Club

831
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:02,200
it gets very difficult with the sizing

832
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:05,360
that's probably what you were referring

833
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:07,278
to of Machinery like hbag I mean in

834
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:09,878
regards to lighting it's not a problem

835
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:13,079
like we can sell you one fixture or

836
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:15,960
thousands but yeah it gets very

837
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:18,200
difficult regarding HB for example I

838
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,480
have discussions with social club guys

839
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:23,279
they want to go full capacity 500

840
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,199
members I do the calculations for them

841
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,879
introduce them to the HB company and the

842
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:30,439
HB company says well it's going to be

843
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:32,679
about 500,000 for the agback and they're

844
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,079
like ah because they don't want to do

845
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:37,000
project business and the politics are

846
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:39,519
not set up for correct business in

847
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,800
Germany at the moment which I find

848
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:44,838
drastic because cannabis has deserved

849
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:48,519
way better laws um where a real industry

850
00:34:44,838 --> 00:34:50,639
can flourish uh yeah long story short I

851
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:52,759
have no answer yeah I think it will be

852
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,760
really connected to the The Growing

853
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,800
System the way how you grow the plants

854
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,520
that should be connected um if it's

855
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,119
small scale then you should look up all

856
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:03,039
the plant types and adjusting in that

857
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:06,720
way a bit the way how you're growing and

858
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:09,039
that then it can be uh possible to grow

859
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:11,239
a small scale and have still a returnal

860
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:13,320
investment but it's a it's a challenge I

861
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:16,319
think we can uh face all together in the

862
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:19,039
industry and um Find A Way

863
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:23,119
Forward change the politics the

864
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:23,119
politicians I think

865
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,639
absolutely okay I didn't want to steer

866
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:30,279
it in that direction for a question we

867
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:33,159
still have room for one more question we

868
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:35,240
have we have three minutes or if anyone

869
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:37,639
would like to sing a song or we could

870
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:39,319
have a trivia Contest no looks like

871
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:41,598
there's one at the back I see is there

872
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,400
one in the back hand yeah there's a

873
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,160
microphone right there for you my friend

874
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,480
it's my

875
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:50,199
friend hi guys uh gentlemen uh in terms

876
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,119
of with all the new data and

877
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:54,279
possibilities to extract them from what

878
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:56,079
we are actually doing like you find

879
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,640
yourselves like seeing living soil

880
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,720
having like um like can I say like a

881
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:02,519
bigger space in the upcoming cultivation

882
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:05,598
Technologies

883
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:07,318
thanks we have some cultivators that do

884
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,519
very well with living soil obviously

885
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:12,279
it's uh it's very difficult so it's

886
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:14,519
going to take the certain you know the

887
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,880
correct mindset to be able to be

888
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:19,239
successful but living soil is amazing

889
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,160
the product's As Good As It Gets yeah

890
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:24,039
for sure you you can grow in living soil

891
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:27,440
the the only downside I potentially see

892
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:30,199
is uniformity and having always the same

893
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,280
uh um product there that is probably the

894
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:35,078
the difficult thing and if the you can

895
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,960
find a way to have it a bit more

896
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:39,318
standardized and did you know that every

897
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,119
time you start with it it's the same as

898
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:42,960
what you initially did and then I think

899
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,280
it definitely has a future in the

900
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,880
industry in the growing systems you're

901
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,920
getting into a whole new high science

902
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,920
with living soil Jesus we should have

903
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,440
started with that I mean I can go crazy

904
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,280
living so have to do a living soil panel

905
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,200
next year yeah right there's amazing

906
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,920
things being done in living soil and and

907
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:02,519
and also in technology to make you know

908
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,559
soil work in large scale that uh you

909
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:08,719
know so yes I think it's possible yeah I

910
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:12,799
love my cucumbers on living soil oh yeah

911
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:16,639
great veggies yeah I think we all

912
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:20,119
do but my cannabis is grown on rock wool

913
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:20,118
but so is

914
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:26,159
mine all right one more you have a

915
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:29,560
question come on over to the

916
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:34,318
microphone come on fall down just a

917
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:37,400
simple question uh we sell also G uh CO2

918
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:42,639
generators and SO2 regulators and

919
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:45,960
battles so we need and this this is no

920
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:49,679
future of course

921
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:52,880
CO2 plants cannabis plants love CO2 high

922
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:56,399
levels yes yeah we can have more in the

923
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:59,240
atmosphere as well is it is it just have

924
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,519
bigger plants out there

925
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:03,358
yes so you think Los Angeles would uh

926
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:05,079
grow the best weed there's so much CO2

927
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:07,400
in the air down there

928
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:10,000
but right just grow in a big polluted

929
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,880
city outside and get all the CO2 you

930
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,480
want is it is it that big of a

931
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,200
difference if you use like CO2 or an

932
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,000
ozone generator or some things like that

933
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:19,838
yeah and and honestly if you for example

934
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,079
I just talked to a customer they ran out

935
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:26,838
of CO2 Supply wasn't there week six

936
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:28,880
1,400 micro really driving the Porsche

937
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:31,960
um there the sense of like they're

938
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,400
really growing uh on the edge um

939
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:37,039
unfortunately CO2 wasn't there anymore

940
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,160
and the plants get really problems once

941
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:40,960
you start supplementing and you're full

942
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:42,799
on they're going through withdraw you

943
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,639
got them hooked it's same with

944
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,720
everything if you take the water away

945
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:48,279
the light

946
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:49,719
intensity to all your marks it's like me

947
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:54,839
without

948
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:57,559
caffeine or THC probably both right the

949
00:38:54,838 --> 00:38:59,880
player just has vivid dreams but doesn't

950
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:01,719
do much uh all right I think we're out

951
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,440
of time but let's hear it again for our

952
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:05,679
