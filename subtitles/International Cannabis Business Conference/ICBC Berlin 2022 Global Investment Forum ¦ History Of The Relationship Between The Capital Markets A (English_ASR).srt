active in the market

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,320
so given that we just have a half an

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,200
hour i just jumped straight in and my

34
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,879
first question goes to claudia um

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,040
claudia provided that cannabis is not

36
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,599
yet federally legal in the world's

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,600
largest market in the united states

38
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:30,239
cannabis companies any vertical have

39
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,599
historically struggled to raise money

40
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,280
what have been the roadblocks for

41
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:34,798
cannabis companies this far in the

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,560
capital market

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,680
okay so this is thank you hello

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,399
everybody so this is a question that has

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,520
been discussed for many years right but

46
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,399
we've seen

47
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:50,959
major changes from 2017 18 19 2020 2021

48
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,519
2022 i mean just 2022 is extremely

49
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,438
different from 2021 right

50
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,078
so in general the differences have been

51
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,398
that not being federally illegal

52
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:03,599
in most countries i mean at least in the

53
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,759
in the main countries uh besides canada

54
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,679
which was actually a very very good uh

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,840
example that's why canada was able to

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,439
raise this huge amount of money through

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,640
the public market

58
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,039
um

59
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,359
so uh the the problem of listing

60
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,159
companies in the big exchanges

61
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,680
uh

62
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,919
the companies that touch the flower

63
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,239
cannot list on the nasdaq on new york

64
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:27,839
stock exchange and we know that listing

65
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:31,039
a company the big big exchanges uh is a

66
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,000
big source of capital right so they they

67
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,159
end up

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,199
listing the small exchanges like the otc

69
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,519
market

70
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:40,959
and that has never been you know a very

71
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,599
favorable uh solution for uh

72
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,759
for for big raise or cash flowing or

73
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,280
growth right of value

74
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,799
so this is this has been a problem for

75
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,519
many many years

76
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,000
um but then we've seen

77
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,120
many changes in the economy right uh

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,878
after the big bubble in 2019

79
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,680
then we got you know of course investors

80
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:04,878
got extremely you know disappointed then

81
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,280
we got covered 2021 2020 2020 was very

82
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,239
difficult to raise equity mostly was

83
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,640
that

84
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,480
all of a sudden in 2021 we've seen a

85
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,119
major shift

86
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,039
um the the equity value went up of

87
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,360
course that was also due to

88
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,120
the elections in the united states and

89
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,200
the the expectations of federal

90
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,158
legalizations coming really soon or um

91
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:27,679
or

92
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,560
federal

93
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,640
legislating legislating bills like the

94
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,759
the safe banking act passing and

95
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:38,399
allowing companies to to to source money

96
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:41,199
and cheap money from banks right

97
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,760
um then after that we've seen 2021 you

98
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,199
know did not do not satisfied investors

99
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,679
did not satisfy you know the

100
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,158
expectations of federal legalizations

101
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,319
and all of a sudden the the equity value

102
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:56,158
and uh dropped enormously uh and now as

103
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:58,560
of you know

104
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,479
june 2022

105
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,799
uh equity value

106
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,959
uh the the average equity value of

107
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:09,120
companies comp year to date compared to

108
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:12,239
june 2021 there was a drop of 40 percent

109
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,879
40 of equity value

110
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,918
so then you know we've seen

111
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:21,319
a major shift also uh in invest in

112
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,959
raising equity versus debt right so in

113
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:25,360
2021

114
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,198
um we've seen of course the equity value

115
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,319
was much higher so

116
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,919
m a activity was was more frequent

117
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,079
and

118
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:37,519
and companies used to prefer using

119
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:40,240
equity for acquisitions than debt

120
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:43,680
at the same time debt slowly but surely

121
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,918
became cheaper at the same time so as we

122
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,160
know since there's no safe banking act

123
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,198
and you cannot raise money from regular

124
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,360
banking

125
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,040
um has been it's been extremely

126
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,520
expensive to finance these companies

127
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,600
we're talking about rates in the teens

128
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:02,000
okay even over 20 i mean usually rates

129
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,400
um then in 2021 we've seen all of a

130
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,879
sudden that some of the best performing

131
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:11,198
companies best performing i mean

132
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:12,560
positive gross margin okay like truly

133
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,720
gti

134
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,600
they were able to raise that seven

135
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,039
percent eight percent unheard of before

136
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,039
right so cheap that now this cheap that

137
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,599
really is only available for big

138
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:28,478
companies multi-state operators okay the

139
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,960
small companies are still paying 15 16

140
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:34,079
or plus percent in that right so this

141
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,680
was 2021 then all of a sudden 2022

142
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,399
there's this huge

143
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,560
crash in equity value so nobody wants to

144
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,758
use it's very tough to raise equity

145
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,720
right also because you're going to get

146
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,600
deluded a lot as a company or acquiring

147
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,199
you know

148
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,400
other companies with you know with

149
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,520
equity

150
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,799
so we've seen an increase again in debt

151
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,279
in that race

152
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,400
and what what's been actually very

153
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,239
interesting

154
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,359
is that um

155
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,560
lenders

156
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,919
uh you know big lenders companies they

157
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,839
are raising a debt a really cheap

158
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:10,959
interest rates like on the five six

159
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:13,279
percent and they're making a huge spread

160
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,839
you know so this is my you know point of

161
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:19,038
view yeah super interesting um to see

162
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:21,198
that developments um ria for you uh like

163
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:24,079
you're more active on the start-up side

164
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,400
um and in the uk which is also like that

165
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,719
it's not federally legal or anything um

166
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:31,198
but other than recreational cannabis

167
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,120
reform what were roadblocks that you saw

168
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,840
for the startups companies that made it

169
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,160
also difficult to raise funds

170
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,560
well everybody's had a rocky couple of

171
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,960
years you know in 2018 there was so much

172
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,360
momentum and excitement about the

173
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,839
potential of cbd products the whole

174
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,240
shift in legislation and a lot of

175
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,839
companies came in and came hard and

176
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,079
exhausted their marketing budget then

177
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,560
were hit by kovid and then were hit by

178
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,719
the novel food act and they've just had

179
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,800
one problem after the other so

180
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,240
it feels like also the hearts and minds

181
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,079
of these companies they've kind of lost

182
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,400
their drive and momentum and and they've

183
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,318
had so much red tape

184
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,719
money they've just thrown so much money

185
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,000
at things like legals and

186
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,759
also

187
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,279
when we're in an industry that's so

188
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,000
unique and doesn't

189
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,598
work in the conventional way so we have

190
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,240
to think outside the box with marketing

191
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:24,719
with banking with everything so because

192
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,560
it's just one roadblock after the other

193
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,000
i think the novel food act for a lot of

194
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,240
companies was the last straw to be

195
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,598
honest and it knocked out maybe 80 90 of

196
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,120
the small

197
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,360
small momentum that was just starting

198
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,079
within the cbd industry

199
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,759
but

200
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,159
the reason why we created the magazine

201
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,840
was to be a container to document these

202
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,520
shifts because it's such an

203
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:44,799
unpredictable territory nobody really

204
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,198
knows what's going to happen the time

205
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,360
scales are ever changing and it's a

206
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,160
global it's a global global ecosystem

207
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,720
and each ecosystem in turn affects its

208
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,280
neighbours and europe

209
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,800
is so privileged because we're at the

210
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,638
point now where we can stand on the

211
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,240
shoulders of giants because we have an

212
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,038
international community that are coming

213
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,038
over

214
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:08,639
and they're willing and able and they've

215
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,918
got resources to help this help us not

216
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,079
make the mistakes that have been made

217
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,318
over the over the other side of the pond

218
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,918
and the other thing that i've found in

219
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,919
europe is the attitude here is just

220
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:19,519
completely different it's got a very

221
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,279
different paradigm towards cannabis

222
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,439
we've had coffee shops in amsterdam for

223
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,119
a long time and it's not only the

224
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,038
population density that makes europe

225
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,959
exciting for these investors so i think

226
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:31,199
this is the prime time

227
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,519
to optimize this window of opportunity

228
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,759
to create these symbiotic relationships

229
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,440
that benefit not only the suits but the

230
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,599
roots and everybody in between and

231
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,279
hopefully the main people who benefit

232
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,000
are the users and the consumers and the

233
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,439
patients and what i feel

234
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,839
personally i've worked in the cannabis

235
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,680
industry for 20 years i'm not a root or

236
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,279
a suit i'm a fruit

237
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,159
my mum has been in the cannabis industry

238
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:57,039
for a long time and if you want to speak

239
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,319
to experts and veterans you don't find

240
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,480
them in the legal market you find them

241
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,760
in the legacy market the legacy market

242
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,000
does not need the regulators the

243
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,319
regulators need the legacy and once we

244
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,639
realize this and we work in a symbiotic

245
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,040
symbiotic harmonious way

246
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,199
everybody benefits in a rising tide all

247
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,519
the ships come up together and if we can

248
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,600
create these relationships that's where

249
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,519
i believe it's all going to thrive yeah

250
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,519
that's very true

251
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,839
so let's go a little have a little look

252
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,399
into vertically integrated companies

253
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,000
historically verticality has had

254
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,240
successful cannabis apart from their

255
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,080
competitors merger and acquisition have

256
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,240
been the best method of growth to remain

257
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,320
competitive how do these mergers and

258
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,919
acquisitions been financed providing the

259
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,000
constraints on these capital raised

260
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,639
markets

261
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,720
so we we actually touched on the really

262
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:45,600
integrated companies and you know the

263
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,160
the

264
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,759
the roadblocks right uh you know united

265
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:54,319
states uh has been a good example of

266
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:58,000
having to recreate manufacturing

267
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,800
cultivation facilities in every states

268
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,200
um that's why we have to you know m a is

269
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,120
the solution because you need to acquire

270
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,879
you need to expand and uh

271
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,759
i mean think about it right so if you

272
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,919
have to

273
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,159
start as a vertical integrated company

274
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,679
start uh cultivation facilities

275
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,278
extraction facilities manufacturing

276
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:18,239
facilities in every state you know it

277
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:21,439
takes time right not just money so it

278
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,919
might as well just acquire you know uh

279
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,720
the the companies that already have been

280
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,360
you know

281
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,240
successful or they're already existing

282
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,360
so

283
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,000
now i mean in the in the

284
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,720
lately we've seen also um

285
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,958
a lot of m a uh from uh

286
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,240
public public companies to public

287
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,119
companies

288
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,440
okay

289
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,480
uh briana goodness and of course now

290
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,040
columbia care and crest collabs

291
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,680
now we just said five minutes ago that

292
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:53,360
equity value dropped enormously in the

293
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,599
past year

294
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,879
and why are these companies doing stock

295
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,360
to stock right all stock acquisitions

296
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,679
and that's because you know if they

297
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,680
acquire stocks dropped also the target

298
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:07,919
stuff the stocks dropped right so it

299
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,159
just makes sense and also for the target

300
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,399
companies it makes sense to sell

301
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:15,039
and receive and be paid you know with

302
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,320
stocks because they know the upside

303
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,399
at the moment

304
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,200
at the moment the the market is is

305
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,720
trailing at a big discount

306
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,000
uh and

307
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,360
we have an ebitda multiple in 2022 of

308
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,879
six percent

309
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,839
uh six times sorry and 2023 over five

310
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:33,439
times

311
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,440
ebitda multiple which is you know

312
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,320
typical of um

313
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,959
of mature mature mature industry

314
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,879
and not definitely not uh you know a

315
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,639
growing and upcoming and you know in the

316
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:45,759
industry with all of this upside all

317
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,559
over the world

318
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,679
um so it's a you know it's it's

319
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,399
basically

320
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,000
way better to as i said to to use that

321
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,600
or to use equity only if you're

322
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,039
acquiring you know with equity and other

323
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,839
companies

324
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:02,639
um ria what about the uk do you see a

325
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,240
lot of m a happening in the uk or what

326
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,079
is the situation other companies more

327
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,919
vertically integrated or do you have

328
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,519
more specialist countries what is the

329
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,120
situation there

330
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,399
i think the only way the companies are

331
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,240
going to work in the uk is if they've

332
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,278
got american partners realistically

333
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,120
because they're coming with the

334
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:19,278
experience the knowledge and the money

335
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,879
and they're just forward thinking if

336
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,879
they're thinking about the future and

337
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,958
the long term plan and they're not

338
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,958
looking for an immediate return

339
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,479
they they can work in within europe if

340
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,838
you look at cookies for example even

341
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,440
though it's not a legal market they're

342
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,440
getting their clothing brand shops all

343
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,720
over europe they're preparing for things

344
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,720
to change even though they don't know

345
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,240
what it's going to be or how long

346
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,079
so i think that the long game players

347
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,399
look at it through lifestyle through

348
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:46,719
culture through celebrating things i

349
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,799
mean realistically all the market that's

350
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,839
coming through the medical patients the

351
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,599
the notoriety come from people like rick

352
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,440
simpson frenchy colony who's another

353
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,278
legend that's that's part of the the

354
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,680
black market the great well black it's

355
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,759
not they were they were original

356
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,000
legends and found that foundations that

357
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,360
have then we've start we've stand on the

358
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,720
shoulders of giants you know and these

359
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,680
are all from the

360
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,120
fringe

361
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,719
fringe illegal

362
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,879
people that had the bottle to go out and

363
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,320
do things because they had a need their

364
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,838
need was more important than the

365
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,879
financial benefit

366
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,360
um just out of it just out of interest

367
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:22,559
let me do a crowd participation who in

368
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,039
this room

369
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,799
is here because they have a personal

370
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,639
story about cannabis cannabis help them

371
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,319
over in their personal house or in their

372
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,799
own family

373
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,639
and i think these are the people

374
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,319
that are going to change the industry

375
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,079
because their drive isn't conventional

376
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,639
their drives deeper the purpose is more

377
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,638
important and for me as the daughter of

378
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,600
a patient as somebody who's treated

379
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,519
cannabis to 7 000 patients illegally for

380
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,199
the past six years in the uk

381
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,959
personally if i spend the rest of my

382
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,120
life working for this plan i could still

383
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,559
not repay everything that she's given me

384
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,639
and i know there's a lot of people that

385
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,559
feel the same way and it's that passion

386
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,320
and that drive and that fire that's

387
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,239
going to make sure that this doesn't

388
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,120
become extinguished and i loved what

389
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,720
jamie said on the panel earlier about

390
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,399
it's the ceo who's going to have the

391
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,160
biggest balls

392
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,600
and i believe that ceo is going to be a

393
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:12,958
woman

394
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,600
and that's why we're telling the story

395
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:17,518
through the women and what i believe the

396
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,440
the female way to tell a story is it's a

397
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,198
circular model and the beautiful thing

398
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,120
about this industry is there isn't one

399
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:24,879
person in the world who knows everything

400
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,159
there is one doctor you can go to who

401
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,879
can give you all the answers there isn't

402
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,319
one specialist but there's a circular

403
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,799
model of everybody who's got a little

404
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,278
piece of the puzzle and it's forcing us

405
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:37,359
to come into a situation where now is

406
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,039
the time for radical collaboration and

407
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,879
we need to work like nature nature

408
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,958
doesn't compete it collaborates and if

409
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,958
we can work out what that looks like the

410
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,119
foundations we lay in these next 10

411
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:49,359
years are going to be felt for decades

412
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,560
if not centuries to come this window of

413
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,560
opportunity

414
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:53,278
is is a privilege you know those with

415
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,719
the

416
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,958
those with the privilege to know have

417
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,199
the duty to act the people in this room

418
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:01,039
and tomorrow we're letting we're laying

419
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,879
foundations that are far bigger than us

420
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,480
and if we don't do it with integrity and

421
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,159
correctness

422
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,839
what are those what are the future years

423
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,600
going to look like we've got 100 years

424
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,920
of r d to do because it's been

425
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,519
prohibited globally so we haven't got

426
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:15,759
time to waste and we haven't got time to

427
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,440
mess around there's so much talent and

428
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,360
beauty and skill and passion in this

429
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,720
industry the next 10 years are going to

430
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,959
be key and the only way to do that is

431
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,240
with sharing and mergers

432
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,239
thank you for saying that it's very

433
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,399
important

434
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,480
so let's have a look at a little bit at

435
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,159
trends um what are some trends that have

436
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,680
been holding capital raises in the

437
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:38,399
cannabis space claudia

438
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,638
well actually i mean we just attached on

439
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,240
this right 2022

440
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,000
um has been

441
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,759
you know very difficult to raise equity

442
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,799
as we said because of that you know

443
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:52,639
lower value and equity so more debt even

444
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:54,719
the debt funds have raised you know

445
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,039
more a lot of money with you know which

446
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,800
with with cheap interest rates for them

447
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,078
and high interest rates for you know for

448
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,958
the companies

449
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:04,319
um

450
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:07,039
so so at the moment at the moment uh uh

451
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,399
let's say that equity raises uh year to

452
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,838
date are like down 70 to something like

453
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,039
this 74

454
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,839
in the united states even more in canada

455
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:21,519
um debt raises are high a lot in the

456
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:24,320
united states but also very very down in

457
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,480
like 90 percent in canada year to date

458
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,079
as of june 2022

459
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,079
so basically it's like a moment of of of

460
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,758
pause okay

461
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,399
this in addition to

462
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:39,759
the general public markets i mean you

463
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,519
know the regular sap s p 500 and uh you

464
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,759
know the other industries everything is

465
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,480
down so if you speak with any investment

466
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,000
bank or investors they kind of uh

467
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,159
there's at this very moment they're

468
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,958
saying that they're just waiting for for

469
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:54,639
the dust to settle basically and that's

470
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,399
why you see a lot of consolidations

471
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,759
right now for you know economies of

472
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,159
scale and

473
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,079
ability to to continue growing right on

474
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,480
uh with just some acquisition of stocks

475
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:07,759
to stocks but you know i'd like to you

476
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:11,199
know uh ria victoria she's she's an

477
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:13,759
expert in the industry uh more in the uh

478
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,240
the legacy industry where i come from in

479
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:17,599
a finance world so it's very different

480
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,679
so um

481
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,000
i wanted to ask her you know what what

482
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,480
do you think uh the

483
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,599
you know the the legal uh the legal the

484
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,519
legal space of the industry can take as

485
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,839
as you know

486
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,918
examples or directions from the legacy

487
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:35,918
world in terms of you know growth and

488
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,440
survivals

489
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,120
best product wins if you've got a good

490
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,360
product it'll last the test of time if

491
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:43,918
you're selling a crappy product because

492
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,279
you expect your audience to not know the

493
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,640
difference between a good product and a

494
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,599
bad product

495
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,679
then

496
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,279
you don't deserve to succeed in if

497
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,480
you're giving bad products to cancer

498
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,720
patients and people that are really

499
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,360
suffering and need that medicine and it

500
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,880
isn't the best you can possibly produce

501
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,639
why are you doing it you know and i

502
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,919
think if though if you've got a good

503
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,759
product and you're coming from a good

504
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,679
place those are the ones that will last

505
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,960
the test of time so so can you grow

506
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,759
organically without big fundraising

507
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,279
if

508
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:13,440
if your products are you know

509
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,599
particularly good well this is where we

510
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,960
created icann a link because we found

511
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,159
there's such a need

512
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,319
because even though we're speaking the

513
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,759
same language it's not the investors and

514
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:24,319
the money people aren't speaking to the

515
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:27,200
legacy people it's like we was at the

516
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:29,599
mary jane show and

517
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,200
you know hydro guys and black market

518
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:32,798
guys they're a very special they don't

519
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,798
talk to everybody and they don't open up

520
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:36,798
to everybody and they don't want to talk

521
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,400
to the suits necessarily they don't even

522
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:39,918
want to and not only do they not want it

523
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,120
they haven't got time they don't want

524
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,559
investment and they think the whole

525
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:46,558
thing's dirty ironically

526
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:48,319
and i think if we can create these tools

527
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,879
that become the bridge that's what

528
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:53,439
icanna link is it's a way of

529
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,640
bringing in all our expertise from the

530
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,919
i mean if you're speaking to somebody

531
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,520
with over 10 years experience they

532
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,600
haven't got that experience in a legal

533
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,279
market and why would you want someone

534
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:04,159
with less than 10 years experience doing

535
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:06,879
anything for your company so we're using

536
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,400
icalilink as a bridge for industry to

537
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,320
connect with black market and we're

538
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,400
using green queen magazine to document

539
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,000
the story and shape the narrative

540
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,000
constantly with the three pillars of

541
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,919
destigmatisation decentralization

542
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,919
decriminalization this is our plan they

543
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,440
can't give us back because it's ours we

544
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,240
need to claim it and i think that this

545
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,640
process this dance that happens between

546
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,400
the legal market and the legacy market

547
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,799
is the legacy market's all about

548
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,880
education like if you go to these

549
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:36,400
weed shows and secret sessions and cups

550
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,880
they've got so much knowledge in the

551
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,640
room it's it's above and beyond what you

552
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,000
could eat like some people you can get

553
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,360
to them and they just keep going for

554
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,279
hours days

555
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:47,119
and yet you've got patience we were

556
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,558
speaking to hannah deacon who's a legend

557
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:52,239
in the uk she is the first um her son he

558
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:54,160
was the first child to get cannabis

559
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,720
prescription she's been fighting

560
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,240
endlessly for epileptic children access

561
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,400
and she said on one of the panels that

562
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,159
we did she said i don't care whether

563
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,000
it's good i don't care whether it's the

564
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,360
best i just want it to work i don't want

565
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,798
to know any of this information that

566
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:08,158
you're talking about i just want it to

567
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:10,639
work for my son and i don't want to have

568
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,159
to worry about it and this is

569
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,480
the two different languages that we're

570
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,400
talking but actually if we bring in the

571
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,079
best products and we bring in the best

572
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,519
teams and we're bringing this experience

573
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:20,558
that's been learnt through the test

574
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,798
through the

575
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,879
trial of fire what else could happen but

576
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,480
succeed so i think if we come in with

577
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,799
the best intentions the best will happen

578
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,720
and if we can create these

579
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,240
vehicles that allow the black market to

580
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,079
connect to the industry that's where it

581
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,319
will be optimized

582
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:39,439
um you also did something interesting

583
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:41,359
recently you issued an nft like we also

584
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,000
have alternative fundraising models

585
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:45,839
happening it's not only debt and equity

586
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,960
investment anymore like there are still

587
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:48,798
so many

588
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,240
different options nowadays can you let

589
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:52,960
us know a little bit about that and how

590
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,480
that went wow the cannabis industry is

591
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,400
it might be short of many things but not

592
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,839
creativity so

593
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,840
the necessa

594
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,279
the mother of invention is necessity so

595
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,359
because we can't go to conventional

596
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:04,798
routes like banks we're having to think

597
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,038
outside the box a little bit with how to

598
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:09,200
fundraise and

599
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,879
we created an ethereum smart contract it

600
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,440
exists it was created on the 22nd of the

601
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,840
second 2022 and

602
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,919
the idea was to use it as a fundraising

603
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:20,720
platform to then feed back into all of

604
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:23,120
our other projects um

605
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,720
as many things it's another lesson in in

606
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:25,439
how to do things right and wrong and i

607
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,000
think

608
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,120
even though nobody understands nfts at

609
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,400
the moment doesn't mean they're not

610
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,319
going to be integrated into every

611
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,440
industry over the next couple of years

612
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:36,480
so

613
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,240
even though we are first in the space

614
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,640
we're trying to integrate things like

615
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,038
utility events and create these

616
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,360
partnerships in the digital world so

617
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:47,919
there's two aspects to sharing knowledge

618
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,038
there's knowledge and wisdom so wisdom

619
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,440
is these

620
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:52,798
this example of like an ongoing teaching

621
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,120
so your relationship with your business

622
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:57,359
partner your children the forest

623
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,038
your yoga practice it continues to teach

624
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:02,000
you it continues to grow whereas

625
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,679
knowledge is like a snapshot like a um

626
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,200
like a photograph like if you get

627
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,559
somebody's written a book two years ago

628
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,000
it was a snapshot of their knowledge

629
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:08,879
then now they think something completely

630
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,960
different

631
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,200
so what we're doing is we we're creating

632
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,079
both simultaneously to celebrate this

633
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,080
culture so the wisdom is the web page

634
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:20,000
the on-site portal we've got a metaverse

635
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:21,678
training academy that's in the wings

636
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,079
we've got the nft and all of these

637
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,440
digital wisdoms about creating a

638
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,599
container for the community so we

639
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,960
continue to grow through each other and

640
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:30,480
then simultaneously we're doing a

641
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,798
printed book that's kind of bringing

642
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,880
back these collectible

643
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:36,480
physical printed things because we're

644
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,559
taking back our history the first thing

645
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,720
they stole from us was the story and

646
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:42,319
afterwards everything was a was a domino

647
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,319
effect and if we can take back the story

648
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,158
and start celebrating the things that

649
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:47,519
this plant does through

650
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,520
personal

651
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,200
real people how could you argue with

652
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,759
that it not been accessible so our

653
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,600
pillars are health environment social

654
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,038
activism and culture and i think one of

655
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:59,038
the problems we've got with cannabis is

656
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:01,038
the compartmentalization of oh this is

657
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,359
medical this is recreational this is

658
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:04,640
hemp it's not it's the same thing it's a

659
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,240
plan and it's a human right and we

660
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,038
should all have access to it and this

661
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,798
plan is the biggest solution we have to

662
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,319
so many of the problems and as somebody

663
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:15,279
who deals with sick patients we have

664
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:17,599
7000 patients over 66 years

665
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:19,678
what i think cannabis gives

666
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,759
in the most hopeless time in the most

667
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,640
desperate time in the worst time in

668
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:27,440
people's life it gives them hope

669
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,400
we're the custodians of that and this is

670
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,080
a position of service this isn't about

671
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,000
making money this well obviously we're

672
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,319
here to make money but the money should

673
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,400
reflow and re-irrigate back into the

674
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,319
ecosystem that benefits everybody and

675
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,480
when we work like that we use nature as

676
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:44,240
the example and everybody thrives and i

677
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,079
think that's what the plan is constantly

678
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,359
teaching us the more you give the more

679
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:51,439
you were given so

680
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:53,678
it's very interesting struggle between

681
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,480
uh like doing something good and

682
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:59,120
idolized and actually just going for the

683
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,120
money and making a profit right i mean

684
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:03,759
we've seen um

685
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:06,000
both in this industry because we got

686
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:07,919
wall street in we got

687
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,278
um

688
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,799
activists and scientists researchers

689
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:14,240
in the industry

690
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:15,679
so

691
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,839
i think you know it's going to be very

692
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,159
interesting to see how this develops

693
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:21,519
throughout the world with developing

694
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,520
countries

695
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,200
coming online producing for developed

696
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,879
countries

697
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,960
legislation kind of you know creating

698
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,640
reasons for slow downs i mean you know

699
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,640
we see in the united states so this

700
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,240
cultivation facility is done in michigan

701
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,559
massachusetts

702
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,919
uh illinois i mean what will happen what

703
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:42,879
will happen right when federal

704
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:46,240
legalization happens and mexico goes

705
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,200
completely legal uh you know to to those

706
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,200
to those

707
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,159
to those to those states but also at the

708
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,880
same time uh in the u.s there's a big

709
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:57,919
deal about uh social equity i don't know

710
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,960
if you know about about that and uh you

711
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,799
know

712
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,880
if there's a similar situation in the

713
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:05,679
united in in europe

714
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:09,039
but social equity is basically

715
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,919
helping uh minorities and uh uh you know

716
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:11,919
develop

717
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,960
developing their dreams and and

718
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,799
establishing businesses and

719
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,360
i think that

720
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:21,839
that that is also very important but it

721
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:24,558
has to be done in an intelligent way so

722
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:27,519
if i want to advise someone who you know

723
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:29,200
doesn't have the same opportunities as

724
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,359
someone graduating from harvard or

725
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,960
whatever i wouldn't just tell them to go

726
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:34,879
and do a cultivation facility in

727
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,880
massachusetts because in our next few

728
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,960
years they're going to go bankrupt right

729
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,200
so i want to actually help them to to be

730
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,440
successful now to fail so i think

731
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,120
there's a lot of ignorance

732
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,120
around all of this and legalization is

733
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,879
definitely going to an international

734
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:49,839
trade is going to affect

735
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,000
how

736
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,759
uh you know the success of this industry

737
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,038
and then again we go back to the funding

738
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:57,440
and why

739
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:59,679
why some companies especially the

740
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,919
consumer product focused companies are

741
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,600
are trying to to

742
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,799
to take the market in north america

743
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:09,439
which is a cash flow rich

744
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:11,359
cash flow rich market

745
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,600
mostly because of

746
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:16,879
because of a recreational recreational

747
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:18,959
cannabis right while uh wellness and

748
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,278
pharmaceutical companies are

749
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,600
investing and focusing operationally and

750
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:25,519
and financially into latin america

751
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,278
europe or asia asia is going to be the

752
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:29,519
biggest market and nobody even talks

753
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:31,359
about it but it's going to be strictly

754
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,519
uh medicinal

755
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,278
so yes uh so there's a lot of m a lot of

756
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:38,798
expansion in different different uh with

757
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:40,880
different uh you know strategies

758
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:44,158
you just mentioned also the recreational

759
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,240
cannabis reform in in the u.s um like i

760
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,320
personally hope that like with all this

761
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,599
uh recreational reform sweeping across

762
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:52,000
the globe that we will also have

763
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:53,119
improvements in other areas what do you

764
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,200
think

765
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,199
will the for example for the states

766
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,519
change in the current relationship with

767
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,159
capital markets once they potentially

768
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:04,839
legalize on a national level so you mean

769
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,559
like capital markets and and federal

770
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:09,439
legalization the openness towards

771
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:11,359
investment with uh federal reform coming

772
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,600
in well i mean i'm sure everybody knows

773
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:15,359
about this in this room but i mean if

774
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,839
you come from oil and gas or consumer

775
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,519
products or you know they're pharma you

776
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:21,599
and you're in your fund manager you

777
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:23,440
raise your money from

778
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,519
you know institutional institutional

779
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,399
sources such as

780
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:30,158
endowments insurances pension funds you

781
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:32,319
were talking about billions and billions

782
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,960
of dollars

783
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:36,879
while in cannabis you can't you raise

784
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,880
money from high net worth and family

785
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,720
offices uh

786
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,799
uh we've seen it

787
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,159
so so also there's a difference between

788
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:46,480
private equity

789
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,840
and public equity and of course the

790
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,360
private debt because right now there's

791
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:52,639
not much you know

792
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:54,158
commercial bank debt right so in private

793
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,919
equity um

794
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,000
again they source money from high net

795
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,278
worth family offices very limited money

796
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,200
most of the private equity funds are

797
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:02,558
struggling i mean they have a nice name

798
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,640
they've done a lot of work but they're

799
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:06,639
not big fans you know there's not much

800
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,559
money available uh so they've been

801
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,880
focusing mostly on private equity

802
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:13,278
strategies always long term kind of you

803
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,080
know kind of five years exit for any

804
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:19,200
industry right or more so they've been

805
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:21,599
focusing more on ancillary companies no

806
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,558
non-touching the plant companies

807
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,798
uh while the public equity such as hedge

808
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:29,759
funds right they always have more

809
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:31,759
capital why not because they go to

810
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:33,759
pension funds absolutely but because

811
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:35,919
they trade so

812
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:37,919
hedge funds you know the trade trade the

813
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,559
market and therefore they just have

814
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,960
bigger volumes but but it's more of an

815
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:45,278
arbitrage short term you know

816
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,360
taking advantage of the situation so you

817
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:49,759
you this is why we've seen in canada so

818
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:52,639
much money being you know raised

819
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:55,119
since 2016 and 17.

820
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,080
the public the public equity have been

821
00:28:55,119 --> 00:29:00,879
focusing more on touching the plant

822
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:04,319
companies such as cultivation

823
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,559
uh retail dispensaries and manufacturing

824
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,720
why because it just generates more cash

825
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:11,918
flow you know with all of its problems

826
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,000
it just regenerates a faster cash flow

827
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,640
so so that's that's some of the trends

828
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,319
that uh that we've seen right now and

829
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,080
also you know lenders i mean lenders

830
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:24,158
prefer prefer uh cultivation and retail

831
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:25,439
because they have collateral right for

832
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,840
safety

833
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,840
and that's been you know most of uh most

834
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:33,599
of the money raised has been into these

835
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:35,359
sectors much less into uh pharma or or

836
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:36,879
ancillary

837
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:39,519
right maybe is something you still want

838
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,520
to add to that also given that uk

839
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:43,278
also doesn't have recreational reform

840
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,038
yet and i've been in contact for example

841
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:47,038
with a couple of investors from the uk

842
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:49,519
and they've they cannot invest in

843
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:51,679
germany for example due to that fact

844
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:52,798
because they don't have cannabis reform

845
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,038
in the uk

846
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:56,960
well i think the the best way for

847
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:59,038
everything to work is global decent

848
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,240
global decriminalization whether that's

849
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:02,398
going to happen or not is another thing

850
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,919
but i think all this red tape that's

851
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,000
being created

852
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,278
is making us think outside the box and

853
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,880
one thing we're not sure of in this

854
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:10,640
industry is creativity like we said

855
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,399
earlier and i think

856
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,840
the best examples we can look at is if

857
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:15,359
we look at nature like the greatest

858
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,278
minds in the world always look at nature

859
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:18,959
as the best example and how does

860
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:21,519
cannabis work in the body well

861
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,759
homeostasis and adaptogen so what does

862
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,839
homeostasis mean it means all the cells

863
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:28,000
share their resources and poisons and

864
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:30,079
they communicate to each other to allow

865
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,440
the ecosystem that the whole thing to

866
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:35,678
thrive and the adaptogen aspect is each

867
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,919
area needs something different and the

868
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,840
plant has this amazing intelligent

869
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,759
healing that fills the gaps that it

870
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,519
needs at the time and it's very

871
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:46,720
difficult to articulate that because the

872
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:48,558
plants driving driving in my opinion so

873
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,720
what will happen i believe if we come

874
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:52,720
from a point of service the plan is

875
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,679
driving and she's got all the answers i

876
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,360
hope all right our time is over so thank

877
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,679
you to the audience thank you to the

878

879
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,159

881
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,799
give up this stage to the next one more

882
