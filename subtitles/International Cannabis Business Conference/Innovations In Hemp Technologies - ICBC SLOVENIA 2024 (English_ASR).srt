1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,040
here to lead us on our final panel

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,278
discussing Innovations and hemp

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:10,039
Technologies as a freelance journ

4
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:11,839
journalist a a huge YouTube star in

5
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:14,119
Germany and he's here for us right now

6
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:16,118
he's been at almost every single ICBC

7
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:17,359
we've thrown let's hear it for Michael

8
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:23,969
canote

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,969
[Applause]

10
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:42,479
yeah uh welcome to the last panel today

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:45,159
which is uh called infusing technology

12
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:47,159
into the emerging hemp industry or

13
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:50,198
infusing technology into the emerging

14
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:55,599
hemp industry you can actually choose

15
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:59,000
but uh we decided to uh to focus on the

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,120
not the on infusing te technology but on

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,759
technology which should be infused into

18
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:06,438
the new hemp

19
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:10,719
industry because the Cannabis industry

20
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:12,679
is also uh talking uh infusing is also a

21
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,239
thing of the Cannabis industry but

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,600
that's not the thing that's not the

23
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:19,719
topic we discussed today just that you

24
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:22,319
know it's not about infusing it's about

25
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:26,719
hemp it's about growing hemp and it's

26
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:29,599
about using new technologies for a

27
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:33,158
harvest that was within the European

28
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:37,399
community Community forbidden until

29
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:40,079
1998 and there was no technological for

30
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:43,000
uh no te technological progress in the

31
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:46,959
hemp industry or in growing hemp in

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,040
farming hemp for nearly 60 years because

33
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,158
it was a forbidden plant all the

34
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,439
machines all the

35
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:57,560
technology the new industry started with

36
00:01:54,438 --> 00:02:01,279
was developed in the 1920s and in the

37
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,759
1930s after that there was a gap of 60

38
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,960
years and all the farmers who started in

39
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:10,000
the late '90s when the EU regulated the

40
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:12,479
hemp the hemp farming uh had to use all

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,360
these old Technologies and this is why

42
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:20,199
we decided to put a light on the uh to

43
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,239
put a light on how it is working today

44
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:25,119
did this emerge or do the people or do

45
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,719
the farmers still have to work with

46
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,800
technologies that are like 60 or 70

47
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:34,280
years old for this reason reason I have

48
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,000
two panelists from Slovenia which are

49
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,039
very experienced in the hemp business on

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,360
the one on the one side I

51
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:44,759
have

52
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,760
sorry on the one side I have Petra

53
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:50,679
marinko uh she's well known here in

54
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:53,519
Slovenia for her hemp business for her

55
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,560
hemp company called Navi she's a

56
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:00,360
producing uh Cosmetics uh with uh

57
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,400
natural uh ingredients focusing on

58
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,159
processing and uh focusing on clean

59
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,319
products without any uh chem chemical

60
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,840
ingredients is that right Pedra that's

61
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:13,318
perfectly said Thank you thank you Petra

62
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,000
and then we uh we have uh Mark

63
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:18,919
Bon together with his wife he has a

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,878
small hemp Farm close to

65
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:24,919
maribor and in the beginning as as he

66
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:27,959
told me of course like most of the

67
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:30,399
Slovenian H Farmers a few years six

68
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,959
seven years ago everything was focused

69
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,280
to produce

70
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:39,199
CBD but the hemp plant is not only CBD

71
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,878
CBD is only a very small part of the

72
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:46,318
hemp plant and the CBD Market meanwhile

73
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:49,479
that the Chinese uh control the CBD

74
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:51,438
Market is hard to make money with it's

75
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:55,359
really hard to make money if you only

76
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:57,479
produce CBD or CBD butts or CBD products

77
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,680
but the hemp plant exists of more than

78
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:03,719
only CBD and uh Mark is dedicating the

79
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,040
hemp plants in seven years and also

80
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:09,079
looking for new growing and processing

81
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:12,280
Technologies is that right Mark it's

82
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:17,199
true so you

83
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:20,199
see we're not talking about big

84
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,120
agricultural factories when it comes to

85
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:26,360
hemp farming we're talking mostly about

86
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:30,399
small farmers small companies trying to

87
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:33,600
get into a market which is regul ated

88
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:36,478
differently in every EU Country That

89
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,199
That should we all should know that

90
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:43,758
despite we have a common EU law when it

91
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:46,840
comes to hemp a lot of countries have

92
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:50,240
their own regulations when it comes to

93
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:52,918
CBD when it comes to uh when it comes to

94
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,038
butts and when it comes to other

95
00:04:52,918 --> 00:05:00,639
derivates of the hemp of the hemp

96
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:03,680
plant and so

97
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,160
my first question to you Petra when it

98
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,600
comes to processing

99
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,560
hemp you produce hemp product since when

100
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,240
we first met you were already very

101
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,439
experienced in

102
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:19,680
2017

103
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:23,079
so how do you achieve the pureness

104
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:26,639
that's needed and did anything

105
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:31,519
change ever since you started when it

106
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:34,639
comes to technology in the h

107
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:37,079
processing uh a lot of things changed uh

108
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,120
some of for the better and some for the

109
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:43,599
worse I would expose better ones because

110
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:47,600
I'm a positive person and uh regarding

111
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,919
the processes that we use into cosmetics

112
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,960
and

113
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,959
uh I would say product making because we

114
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:58,959
don't do only Cosmetics we do also

115
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:01,719
textiles and some other things uh the

116
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:05,079
main thing that we tried to do is to

117
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:08,240
maintain cleaniness of the product and

118
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:13,038
uh when we started this it was very very

119
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:16,000
hard uh to do that so uh we always

120
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,959
wanted to be a bit different because we

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,598
tried to find

122
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:24,120
the the things that for example with

123
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:28,399
extracts we had problems that the at

124
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:31,079
first finding the solution for the

125
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:36,000
bioavailability which is a big problem

126
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:40,959
with hemp uh with with um extracts so we

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,439
try to do many many technology processes

128
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,598
that

129
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:48,560
could get us higher bio

130
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:53,000
availability uh we produced liposomes

131
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:56,000
and stuff like that so it it it was um

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,478
uh we started very fast to implement the

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,680
Technologies into our processes it's

134
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:06,639
changed a lot because now uh a lot pe

135
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:11,280
people's minds are changing I think and

136
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:14,400
um from what I see now uh a lot of um I

137
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:17,239
would say a lot of producers of any kind

138
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,799
are thinking about

139
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,319
um

140
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,840
implementing uh hemp into their

141
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:28,560
businesses so now we are dealing not

142
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:32,038
only with um bioavailability but we are

143
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,598
also thinking in terms of how to reduce

144
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:37,038
the plastic waste how to reduce

145
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:39,878
microplastics coming into our products

146
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:42,918
how to reduce um I don't know how to

147
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:46,199
make it circular uh sustainable and so

148
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:50,079
on so um in terms of packaging for

149
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:54,158
example I have a here is a one of

150
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:56,918
the latest I would say thank you for

151
00:07:54,158 --> 00:08:00,560
guys for bringing this so this is a

152
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:03,758
packaging for our product so we took a

153
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:07,038
step back to make two two steps forward

154
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:10,680
with packaging so one of them is the

155
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:13,598
aluminum tube which is 99% recyclable

156
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,800
and we know that and uh we are using

157
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:20,000
melium and hemp to

158
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,800
make uh packaging which is a very good

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,639
thing it's light uh material we can pack

160
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:31,120
things into that uh um we can post it

161
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:33,918
easily and so on so uh in terms of your

162
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,719
question that you ask how is it changing

163
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:40,879
I think it's changing in many many ways

164
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:43,399
into better because we can use a lot of

165
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:47,439
things that I don't know seven eight

166
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:50,799
years ago we couldn't so this is I think

167
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,720
it's a main reason to yeah yeah thank

168
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:55,120
you very much Petra so before I come to

169
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,879
Mark I have an addition an additional

170
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,120
question

171
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:02,838
um everybody is talking about THC about

172
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:07,278
CBD about Canabis smoking vaporizing

173
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:10,519
medical uh nobody is talking about

174
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,600
sustainability of the hemp plant well

175
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:15,879
why is that

176
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,720
so H it's hard to say why

177
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:22,639
um I come from architectural background

178
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:26,200
and I knew hemp before I knew CBD so uh

179
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:28,838
I knew it in terms of uh construction

180
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,160
material and uh materials that it used

181
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:36,519
to be used as

182
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:40,439
a instead of flx straws and so on and um

183
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:43,679
I think it that we are not seeing that

184
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,839
much it's not because it's too expensive

185
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:50,239
because it's not you know uh you can for

186
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:54,120
example with hemp lime you can use waste

187
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:57,039
material so it's just a term of

188
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:00,679
connecting waste material with another

189
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:03,360
material and building something so so uh

190
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:06,239
I believe that maybe this is happening

191
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,480
because of the band that you mentioned

192
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,200
so there's still stigma around it also

193
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,440
in

194
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,640
construction don't know why but it

195
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:19,160
happens and the other thing uh that is

196
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:22,879
happening is probably because um it's

197
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:24,799
hard to break the

198
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,600
building

199
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:30,439
Society

200
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:33,839
standards in terms of getting into the

201
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:36,480
new materials and so on we are uh doing

202
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,079
that s a little bit like corruption a

203
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,320
little bit I you said that I didn't I

204
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:44,759
didn't say that but it might be that

205
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,519
yeah that also we are starting very

206
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:49,439
interesting project also here in

207
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:53,000
Slovenia with uh promoting this

208
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,880
materials and uh trying to break the

209
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,399
system in terms

210
00:10:54,879 --> 00:11:00,679
of uh this kind of things so I think the

211
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:05,639
future will bring also very nice things

212
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:09,239
in hemp uh other hemp U Technologies

213
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:12,839
used also in construction so um yeah are

214
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,759
just in small details uh which uh you

215
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,440
meet every day in life uh who of you

216
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:18,720
likes uh paper

217
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,480
straws yeah none I think none of you

218
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,680
likes paper straws they just don't they

219
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,159
don't

220
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:28,879
work there there were ham straws the the

221
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:31,439
they work very well in Germany but the

222
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,720
company went bankrupted because nobody

223
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,720
bought those ham straws and they didn't

224
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,959
find any

225
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,000
investors and if you go to Burger King

226
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:42,359
or McDonald's or to all those ugly

227
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,799
places you still find those paper straws

228
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,000
why is nobody producing ham straws from

229
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:50,278
McDonald's I do not understand this

230
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,480
because Hamra work you know they you can

231
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:54,559
really drink through them for 30 or 40

232
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,440
minutes not only for one or two minutes

233
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:59,359
but that's another thing and that's I

234
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,480
think this is uh

235
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,200
one one thing what Petra mentioned the

236
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,120
people just only think in their own

237
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:09,000
bubble people do not leave their bubble

238
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,600
also when they try to find new

239
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,320
markets and now it's really time to come

240
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,560
to Mark I'm uh sorry it took a little

241
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,800
bit longer Mark you're a producer you're

242
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:23,119
a h you're a hemp farmer uh F when I

243
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:27,278
talked to First hemp farmers in

244
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:30,000
1998 either they uh had to uh Harvest

245
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:33,480
manually or they had to use

246
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,278
um machines from the 30s which were made

247
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,000
for other kind of hemp than we have

248
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:41,519
today how do you harvest do do you have

249
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,759
um help do do you use

250
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,799
machines no we still made everything

251
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:49,720
with the

252
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:52,799
hands uh why because uh Slovenia is

253
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,000
pretty much small country it you cannot

254
00:12:52,799 --> 00:13:00,240
go everywhere with big

255
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:03,839
machinery and for my uh Farm it's

256
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,639
that type how we live with the hemp

257
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:10,720
because we have the touch with that

258
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:13,680
special plant and I think we go on that

259
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:17,680
way uh that we made everything with the

260
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:21,278
hands we are pretty much small farm and

261
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:23,120
yeah we we enjoy in that business and

262
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:27,519
it's not hard to do

263
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:30,078
that but still as as long as you harvest

264
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,560
manually uh

265
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:35,638
what kind of Technology do you have to

266
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:38,439
use as a h farmer today okay yeah

267
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:42,278
absolutely it Chang it a lot of that in

268
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:46,240
eight years we are now high

269
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:48,439
technology uh producers we have a lot of

270
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:53,120
uh

271
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:56,320
machineries with that can we fast to do

272
00:13:53,120 --> 00:14:00,078
something I don't know press for cold

273
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:03,040
oil press or protein made or all that

274
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:08,078
things we have now new technology it's

275
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:10,759
absolutely better it's uh lower cost of

276
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:13,599
electricity and all that things I think

277
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:16,199
we are on the start if we think that we

278
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,480
know everything about hemp how to do

279
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:23,120
around hemp I think we are now on the

280
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,600
start the people think that we know

281
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,198
everything about H what can we do no

282
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,560
sorry we are on the start we don't know

283
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:33,559
what can we do

284
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:36,039
everything from the hemp and if politics

285
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:40,159
and Industry and everybody look in the

286
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:43,639
same way then we can do something in the

287
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:45,319
way how or what can we do from the hemp

288
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:50,639
so I look on that

289
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:52,680
way let me ask you uh if besides the you

290
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,600
producing CBD

291
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:59,919
products and can you use the rest of the

292
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:03,159
hemp plant you produce e economically is

293
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:05,838
that possible to use the fiber to use

294
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:08,719
the seeds you produce economically or is

295
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,440
this more is this more a side business

296
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,199
that you do because you're convinced of

297
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:18,160
the plant uh yeah I look on that way we

298
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:21,240
take also the roots from the uh soil

299
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:24,519
because we need it and it's absolutely

300
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,879
economical but we are too small for now

301
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:29,198
Slovenia is too small that we can

302
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:33,399
produce the fibers because with don't

303
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:36,240
have technology but we use everything uh

304
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:38,839
we produce CBD on a little bit different

305
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:44,519
uh way without alcohol

306
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:48,000
T2 uh CO2 we press the dry material and

307
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:52,440
result is dry material and from with

308
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:57,600
that material it's perfect food for

309
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:59,480
Animals uh we use everything what we

310
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,759
have from the hemp

311
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,879
we made uh some small parts of isolation

312
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:07,720
material with that small part of

313
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:10,639
isolation material we made isolation in

314
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:13,639
our accommodation it's smart small

315
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:18,879
accommodation but we can use that but

316
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:22,799
last two years we made a lot of uh time

317
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:27,958
on hemp flowers fermentation nobody on

318
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:30,559
the world uh don't fermentate the hemp

319
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:34,479
flowers and and I want to mate the

320
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:37,719
alcohol from hemp flowers and after two

321
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,159
years I can say it yeah we think that we

322
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:43,639
know how to do that so that's also a new

323
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:45,799
technology you developed yourself kind

324
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:49,399
um can you say so if we don't have

325
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:53,000
technology we can do uh that because we

326
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:57,198
must to know which sugar we needed which

327
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,198
temperature we needed which uh fermenta

328
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:02,359
culture we needed how many that cultures

329
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:05,318
we needed and we must to measure

330
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,959
everything from that and that's pretty

331
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:12,399
much high technology for do that U let

332
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:15,199
me ask you one another short question um

333
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,679
I don't know if uh people from Slovenia

334
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:21,199
know that but despite we legalized

335
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:24,038
cannabis in Germany uh growing hemp is

336
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:27,519
still regulated stricter than in the

337
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:30,599
rest of the EU we have extra strict hemp

338
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:33,759
laws which will not change before next

339
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:36,399
year they announced to change them now

340
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:38,640
but uh CBD buts for example are not

341
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,320
allowed to sell to be sold in shops in

342
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:45,360
Germany this is one example so um in

343
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:49,558
general our hemp Farmers have trouble

344
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:51,240
with authorities since 25 years and how

345
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:53,279
is that here are you supported by

346
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,120
authorities or is it more that you have

347
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,480
like a little bit trouble and it's a

348
00:17:55,119 --> 00:18:00,399
little bit tricky with

349
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,360
authorities we find falling down uh when

350
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:08,640
I start uh 8 years ago we have in

351
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:13,479
Slovenia 6 600 uh Square hectares now we

352
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:16,240
falling under 150 hectares and yeah

353
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:20,319
that's the situation where we are I

354
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:24,200
think uh that not changing in next 10

355
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:26,798
years because uh the industry don't see

356
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,759
the politics don't see the opportunity

357
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:31,798
what

358
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:35,200
we we feel not we see because we know

359
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:39,798
that that is one of the way for all the

360
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:44,038
people but I think that not changing in

361
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:46,440
couple years um Petra we we just heard

362
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:50,200
uh it went down to 150 hectare hum

363
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:54,000
cultivation here in Slovenia and uh this

364
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:58,038
does not sound as if we are if uh there

365
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,679
isn't a broad Market what does what has

366
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:03,679
to happen so that especially from the

367
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:07,480
building industry hemp is accepted as an

368
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:09,400
opportunity U so because 150 hectar for

369
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:13,079
a country is actually

370
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:16,038
nothing first the change must happen to

371
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:20,639
see the whole plant and the use of plant

372
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:22,759
so I think when people and Industry and

373
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:28,000
politicians will see that this is

374
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:29,240
actually a very good way to make money

375
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,200
also

376
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:35,839
and to do something and it pays off

377
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:40,759
economically too uh I think that needs

378
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:44,319
to happen to to to do that

379
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:46,679
um otherwise I think we have so many

380
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:50,798
Innovative project in

381
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:53,840
Slovenia the technology is building very

382
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:57,879
very fast and with the help of European

383
00:19:53,839 --> 00:20:01,279
Union also as we heard uh hopefully uh

384
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,919
we also get funding for to do projects

385
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:06,839
like that Innovative projects and I

386
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,400
think I believe that it might happen

387
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:12,720
that

388
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,080
um the offer of hemp

389
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:20,640
industry or I would

390
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:25,199
say the production will actually go up

391
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:27,600
because the market will dictate that so

392
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,000
within I I can say that within

393
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,359
construction business building

394
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,319
construction industry and Architects and

395
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:36,479
everything everything is going to

396
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:38,839
sustainability and circularity and you

397
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,640
cannot avoid hemp if you're talking

398
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:43,158
sustainable and if you're talking

399
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:47,520
circular if you're talking non-toxic so

400
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:50,159
those are three things that are key key

401
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:52,720
points for every European funding

402
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:56,760
whatever government is doing is only

403
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:59,400
green sustainable and circular so it's

404
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:03,158
impossible to neglect

405
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,360
a plant that gives so much in future I

406
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:08,240
think okay if I look but if I look on

407
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:11,079
the World Market I can see that most

408
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,759
hemp is grown in grown in China and in

409
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:15,960
non-e

410
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:17,759
countries what role can the European

411
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,679
community and the European commission

412
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:23,359
play when it comes to hem

413
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:26,038
cultivating can they support it with

414
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:28,038
subvention or with uh with money would

415
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:29,278
that help the question goes to both of

416
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:30,798
you

417
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:32,798
would you would would that help you if

418
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,759
you if you could as a ham fber be

419
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:36,798
supported by European Community because

420
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:41,158
they support all kind of farmers but not

421
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:44,359
no h Farmers as far as I know okay uh my

422
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:49,159
opinion on that question is that Europe

423
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:51,798
is small village on that whole earth and

424
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:55,159
that small village some companies said

425
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:59,200
what can we do and what can we not to do

426
00:21:55,159 --> 00:22:03,559
and that's the reason why hemp don't go

427
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:06,600
up but I think if we found Solutions on

428
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:08,798
small business and we growing and we

429
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:11,719
growing and we growing to that point

430
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:14,319
that all around see okay that's

431
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:19,038
opportunity also for us then we can

432
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:23,158
change mindset but the that take time

433
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:26,400
VRA I think it's it will happen and the

434
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:30,919
European Union will do will

435
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:33,080
do will will be be forced to do

436
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:37,080
something about hemp they can they

437
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:40,399
cannot ignore ignore it for a long time

438
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:43,319
um it is happening in all Industries so

439
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,200
we can see that I've been into Cosmetics

440
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:48,399
we can see that in textiles we can see

441
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,840
that in construction so it's always

442
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:56,960
something wrong with hemp for not being

443
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:59,079
the the the plant that has the potential

444
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,640
and with its potential

445
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:06,798
shown in every part of

446
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:09,720
this for instance things that I just U

447
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:14,079
applied I I think it cannot be

448
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:16,038
ignored Mark what do you think uh for in

449
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,558
just for for the audience to know seed

450
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:21,359
production in the EU when it comes to

451
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:23,278
hemp seeds is very limited uh there are

452
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,199
only a very few companies producing

453
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:27,000
seeds and the farmers are not allowed to

454
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,278
produce their own seeds they have to buy

455
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,960
the seeds from the companies mostly

456
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:36,319
located in France or in Italy and uh

457
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:40,519
they have to be compliant with the EU

458
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:44,480
hem catalog and uh different from former

459
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:46,679
times uh the farmers do not control

460
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,640
their own seats would that help if you

461
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:52,320
if Farmers could like in in former times

462
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,400
before hemp was banned could control the

463
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:57,119
seats would that help or is is there a

464
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,038
sense behind regulating seeds on the EU

465
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:04,519
level I think I think uh in Slovenia we

466
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:08,960
have good seats already 100 years ago

467
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:12,558
and uh that seats can growing on our

468
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,640
region or they can give it the best

469
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:16,759
material and uh when we made

470
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,400
[Music]

471
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:21,440
some

472
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,399
changes I think is the best solution

473
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,960
every country which have growing

474
00:24:24,398 --> 00:24:31,359
material they they know that grow on

475
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:36,360
that land perfect they must have that

476
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:39,158
material and I think we lose all our

477
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:45,240
Slovenian seats from the reason that we

478
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:47,880
go on the way where go uh Au Europe a

479
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,319
union that's not good you know this is a

480
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:53,880
very rare treasure that you have the

481
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:56,480
seats from former times here because uh

482
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,799
this uh because ham cultivation in

483
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:03,200
European Community was forbidden in uh

484
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:07,158
1981 I think totally forbidden in 1981

485
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:10,200
or two or or 83 uh there was a and after

486
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:13,640
this uh all the hemp prod producers in

487
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:16,600
the western EU countries had to uh uh

488
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:19,038
had to give away their seats and there

489
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:21,959
it's very rare to have seats uh from

490
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:24,640
before uh 1998 and you should keep that

491
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,159
as a treasure because that can uh that

492
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,799
can be a game chamber in the future yeah

493
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:33,880
we we will see when somebody see what we

494
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:38,038
have it I I look on that way that uh

495
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:39,799
every na nation in European Union must

496
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,919
have some

497
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:45,798
material uh because that representive

498
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:48,679
the nation Slovenian Nation or German

499
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:52,558
Nation or and French nation and they

500
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:55,519
have perfect material for France if we

501
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:58,678
have perfect material from Slovenian

502
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:01,079
then I think we can say that's our

503
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:04,640
material that's our growing material

504
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:07,480
that's our Slovenian people and that's I

505
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,880
don't know German people and so we

506
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:13,759
represent our nation not our history and

507
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,520
we have that I don't know what can we

508
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:20,679
change that but we will see what's

509
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:24,240
happening I think New Age generation can

510
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:29,759
change that and they look a little bit

511
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:32,000
different and I hope that they change it

512
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:35,240
thank you Mark can I just add something

513
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,880
please I would say the same comes to the

514
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,440
construction so we would it would be

515
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:43,480
very nice if we would take a step back

516
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:46,399
and learn from our ancest ancestors how

517
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:50,159
they did it also with hemp and uh

518
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:53,119
natural prod materials and Infuse it

519
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,640
with technology that we know now so we

520
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:59,239
did that with cosmetic products so we

521
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:03,000
can have Botanicals that that are

522
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:06,839
anciently known to be very good but they

523
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,679
are implemented in our products with the

524
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:12,439
new technology we can do this in every

525
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,240
we can do this in agriculture and we can

526
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,640
do this in construction uh business so

527
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,519
it's it's pretty much the same but we

528
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,600
should always look back when we are

529
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:25,918
looking forward so and just to give the

530
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:29,519
audience an example um hemp was grown

531
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:32,480
before uh uh World War II uh it was

532
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:35,398
grown only male plants were used for

533
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,960
fiber for fiber and only female plants

534
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:42,319
were used for seeds the male plants were

535
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:46,319
harvested four weeks before the female

536
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:49,398
plants and anybody growing north of

537
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:52,599
Paris did not produce

538
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:55,199
seeds all those knowledge is gone

539
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:57,639
because the European Community does not

540
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,558
allow male and female seeds the seeds

541
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:04,919
are all H Aphrodite and so you can no a

542
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:07,440
farmer cannot draw a selection like he

543
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:09,640
did 60 years before if he wants to

544
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,120
concentrate on fiber or if he wants to

545
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:15,880
concentrate on seed production this is

546
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:18,759
all gun within the so-called EU hemp

547
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:23,080
reform in

548
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:27,519
1998 and my last question to you is

549
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:29,720
we're talking about new technology and

550
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:32,880
we mentioned a few examples from new

551
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:36,558
technology in the hemp industry but in

552
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,880
how far would you agree that we first

553
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:42,558
have to implement a new

554
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:47,320
politic before we can talk about new

555
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:50,720
technologies and big on and a big and a

556
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:54,519
big uh construction uh production

557
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,880
sorry a big range construction so H in

558
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:58,919
how far would you

559
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:04,080
agree uh

560
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:07,519
I would agree very much because if I go

561
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:11,720
into whichever part of the business that

562
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:13,759
I've known now uh I would say for

563
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,960
example I would I will take construction

564
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:22,519
for example uh politics

565
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:27,038
is doing a lot of times

566
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:29,399
uh sometimes it's hard to make a

567
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:32,879
breakthrough with technology or or a

568
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:35,879
step back because of the regulation so

569
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:39,919
we have that in cosmetics it's it's the

570
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:43,679
same in every every uh aspect of um

571
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:47,399
industry and uh with regulations it's

572
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:50,278
it's it's the same so first that part

573
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:52,398
needs to be settled but it needs to be

574
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:56,960
settled with people that

575
00:29:52,398 --> 00:30:00,439
know a lot about that so um I hope in

576
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,919
Slovenia the regulation that it's going

577
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:07,679
to change is getting all the aspects of

578
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:10,559
the plant not only the medical aspect of

579
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:15,159
the plant and they will think about also

580
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:19,639
in regulative way how to use the the

581
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:22,080
stems the leaves whatever is left from

582
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:26,799
the from the plant that they are using

583
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:29,199
for one medical for example

584
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:30,879
production thank thank you

585
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,558
Petra

586
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,278
um when we entered or when we talked

587
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:40,678
before uh the

588
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:43,519
panel um I I told you that all the

589
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:47,600
medical producers which are a lot

590
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:51,319
meanwhile in in uh Europe South Africa

591
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:53,918
Canada they they throw away all the

592
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:57,398
stamps and

593
00:30:53,919 --> 00:31:00,759
uh even that is ridiculous because we

594
00:30:57,398 --> 00:31:03,398
have so many medical producers now and

595
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:05,839
uh you could use that as biomass and

596
00:31:03,398 --> 00:31:08,158
they have to pay for the destruction and

597
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:12,278
this is one of the regulations I do not

598
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:14,880
understand actually and trash can sorry

599
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:19,519
yeah one trash can be the other ones

600
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:23,240
treasure so uh if we would switch in

601
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:26,919
mindset this kind of thinking we we

602
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:32,038
could get actually free construction

603
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:34,480
material and people would pay to to to

604
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:38,879
to to get it as a people are now paying

605
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:41,038
it as a waste as you said so it's a free

606
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,360
material you just need to collect it you

607
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:45,879
just need to process it which is not

608
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:49,638
even that hard you can use the same

609
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:52,360
process machine that is used for wood to

610
00:31:49,638 --> 00:31:53,918
make the shreds from wood so it's a it's

611
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:56,959
not complicated

612
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:59,120
process so it's just the mindset that

613
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,278
needs to be changed exactly and and

614
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:05,719
cannabis uh cannabis regulation uh is

615
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:08,759
not only a question of uh smoking uh

616
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,440
weed uh having medical weed is also a

617
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:13,119
question of

618
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,000
sustainability and we should not leave

619
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,079
uh or we should separate the the

620
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,200
cannabis plant into the medical

621
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:21,240
recreational ham cannabis plant and the

622
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,759
H plant which does not make high because

623
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:29,399
it's all the same plant and uh in how

624
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:31,599
far are you afraid Mark when when uh

625
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:34,638
your government is regulating the whole

626
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:36,199
cannabis thing which they announced now

627
00:32:34,638 --> 00:32:39,000
that the hemp fiber

628
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:42,639
thing Falls a little bit out of the

629
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,319
focus so because there we saw that a

630
00:32:42,638 --> 00:32:47,678
reform is needed so do you think uh it

631
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:50,158
will be still in Focus or that will fall

632
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:53,038
a little bit apart when cannabis is

633
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:56,000
regulated I think uh in Slovenia we

634
00:32:53,038 --> 00:33:00,638
don't have Focus uh what can we do with

635
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:04,638
the fiber uh or what can we not to do

636
00:33:00,638 --> 00:33:08,558
and that's the problem I know that we uh

637
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:11,199
must to go on that way from construction

638
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:17,519
material Building Material we can do

639
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:21,159
everything what we want to do it's

640
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:23,839
only I can make something some

641
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:26,200
prototypes somebody made another

642
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:29,678
prototype and then when we have

643
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:33,798
something to show you then I think also

644
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:37,200
the industry can see okay really bit big

645
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:40,440
picture what can we do everything but I

646
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,919
hope that Chang it with everything

647
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:47,278
because in that time we don't have

648
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:51,840
industry in Slovenia I think nothing we

649
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:55,319
are on under zero not zero under zero we

650
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:58,079
are in the production of hemp okay CBD

651
00:33:55,319 --> 00:34:02,038
is one of the part we have it but

652
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:04,439
everything else is under zero and from

653
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:07,759
my experience I can say you

654
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:10,760
something when the government legalizes

655
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:14,398
medical cannabis all the companies from

656
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:17,679
other countries will come in and support

657
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:20,239
and sponsor the medical cannabis Market

658
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,200
they build it up for you when it comes

659
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:25,918
to recreational Cannabis same thing

660
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:28,638
happens companies from the countries

661
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:31,239
where cannabis is already legal come to

662
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,960
