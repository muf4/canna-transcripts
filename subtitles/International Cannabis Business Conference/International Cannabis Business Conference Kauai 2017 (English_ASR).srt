1
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:18,049
we're here at the Grand Hyatt on kawaii

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:20,269
for the ICBC conference on cannabis it's

3
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:23,420
a good feeling to know that Hawaii is on

4
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:25,129
starting to get on the map because to be

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,170
real like Hawaii is known for its

6
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:28,879
beaches and tourism and so this gives us

7
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,690
a chance to really shine in ways that

8
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:31,689
are really important

9
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:40,280
my name is Ed Rosenthal a writer

10
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:42,648
publisher and activist and here at the

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,350
convention to help people produce better

12
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:49,280
pot a lot of people are talking about

13
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:52,520
CBD and talking about cannabis is

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,799
medicine but I want to talk with you

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,890
about cannabis as something that

16
00:00:54,799 --> 00:01:02,738
liberates your mind and that to me is

17
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,739
important as a as a medical aspect

18
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,468
reggae music

19
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:08,929
traditionally is the restaurant gospel

20
00:01:06,468 --> 00:01:12,259
music the rest'll money utilized the

21
00:01:08,929 --> 00:01:14,748
arab not to get high or just for

22
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:19,789
recreation it's more of us it has a

23
00:01:14,748 --> 00:01:22,188
spiritual significance Graham's Morgan

24
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:23,868
you know in the group his son had to

25
00:01:22,188 --> 00:01:25,998
have a quarter of his brain cut out at

26
00:01:23,868 --> 00:01:28,099
birth because he was having seizures

27
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:30,949
internally the mother of his child being

28
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:33,858
a scientist created their own brand of

29
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,709
CBD oil called Messiah we sort of have

30
00:01:33,858 --> 00:01:38,629
like a walking talking breathing case

31
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:41,539
study of why we want to be in this

32
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:43,109
industry and it's a hard story to tell

33
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:45,540
and

34
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:48,239
kind of been one that I've kind of kept

35
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,219
to myself it's hard to tell it without

36
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,109
you know breaking down into tears I'm

37
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:55,439
staying professional at the same time

38
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:58,260
but again I see now the value in it and

39
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,939
I believe that it's kind of just my duty

40
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,400
now and it's in my hands to be able to

41
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:06,920
help other people so sharing it was

42
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,920
phenomenal and I'd love to do it again

43
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:20,370
oh yes now I've been to many conferences

44
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:22,379
and conventions and the cannabis ones

45
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,830
are always the fun ones and then you

46
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:27,659
meet a lot of people and you network and

47
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,360
and it's a good group of people to be

48
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:34,500
with especially when we're looking at an

49
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,000
industry which is just growing so look

50
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,330
forward to being a part of this or

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,860
helping out in any way again I would

52
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,650
never ever get any kind of

53
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,570
commercialization if I wouldn't of got a

54
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,189
ticket to come here to what it was that

55
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:49,109
it made it work it worth it and yeah I

56
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:51,509

57

60
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:02,389
