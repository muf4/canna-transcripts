our facility is fully automated and we

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,920
utilize that automation and new

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,520
technologies to try to increase the

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,039
quality of the products that we make for

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,600
our customers

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,840
we're certain that automation and new

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,399
technology will be critical to this

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,520
industry as it starts to scale up and

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,600
meet the future demands of this industry

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,760
what background possibly qualified you

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,159
to build what you're building

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,560
i started out my career in the food

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,479
processing industry doing centrifuging

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,079
and liquid solid separation

34
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,799
distillations

35
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,719
and pres preservatives

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,320
i moved over into the oil field when the

37
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,759
oil field needed some liquid solid

38
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,438
separation and worked over there for

39
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,719
many years in distillation solid

40
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,399
separations

41
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,000
and then when i looked into the cannabis

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,478
industry i saw that there was a real

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,359
need for this kind of technology and we

44
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:33,438
thought that there was a great

45
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,879
opportunity to come help if you google

46
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:38,879
if you google this guy about the only

47
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:41,359
thing that comes up is 40 patents

48
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:44,000
hey guys my name is vince ning um i'm

49

being a tech driven distributor and

52
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,199
trying to make as much as uh you know as

53
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,960
much as possible as a self-service

54
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,719
distributor so you know at the end of

55
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,959
the day we our core competency is we

56
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,399
focus on shipping cannabis products for

57
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,239
brands and helping them get them into

58
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,560
the retail market

59
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,319
what what background led you to that uh

60
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,399
so you know most my professional career

61
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,679
has been in the tech industry and you

62
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,598
know as a technologist we're always

63
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,840
looking for ways to um you know help

64
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,318
bring new software new platforms new

65
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,159
ways to automate industries where uh

66
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,000
there's a high demand for it and so you

67
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,759
know that's how i got into the industry

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and frankly i just have a personal

69
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,598
passion for the product so it was pretty

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,159
natural for me to put those two together

71
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:26,159
and get into it

72
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,239
hey my name is hua i have a company

73
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,400
called meadow

74
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,680
ceo and hey

75
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,439
got some fans

76
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,519
uh ceo and head janitor so uh we do a

77
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,759
lot of things there primarily building

78
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,759
software for retailers and delivery

79
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,518
operators i work with over a hundred in

80
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,919
the state

81
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,519
my wife is also an edible maker

82
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,280
so we're pretty entrenched in the

83
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,319
industry and understand what's going on

84
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,519
there

85
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,039
what brought you what were you doing

86
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,560
before meadow that prepared you to build

87
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,560
that smoking weed

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,158
yeah that's that's one way to get to the

89
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,919
weed business so um you know we were

90
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,639
sort of rapping beforehand about how

91
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,318
tech impacts us but i think uh hua put

92
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,399
his finger on the way that tech will

93
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,560
interfere with everybody's life in the

94
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,640
marijuana business which is metric and

95
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,479
so just to sort of get that rolling and

96
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,158
get that kicked off how many of you have

97
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,280
not don't know what i mean when i say

98
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,039
metric

99
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,199
you raise your hands okay for those two

100
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,318
dudes in the sweater vests in the back

101
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:27,679
um

102
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:29,359
one of you guys want to break it out

103
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,640
probably not mr hardware what about you

104
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,799
guys

105
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:36,399
yeah i'm more happy to talk about it so

106
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,400
metric or uh california track and trace

107
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,879
is what we're going to be using to track

108
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,000
every gram of cannabis that's harvested

109
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:45,919
to you know the consumer and it passes

110
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
along a lot of different parts of supply

111
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,000
chain from the cultivator to the

112
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,400
manufacturer to the distributor the

113
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,680
athletes get lab tested ultimately to

114
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,680
the retailer

115
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,959
and you know through that tracking is an

116
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,120
rfid tag that's basically low jacked to

117
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,199
the plant

118
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,438
and from that you have package ids are

119
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,039
created from that

120
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,840
from that harvest that can be turned

121
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,438
into manufacturing products or you know

122
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,759
finished goods and when it's brought

123
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,598
into the retailer side you also then you

124
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,839
know bring that those package ids as

125
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:18,879
well it's it's pretty

126
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,879
intense

127
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,560
but yeah that's what we're dealing with

128
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,240
and uh you guys

129
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,680
because your position in the industry

130
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,600
you have already done some metric

131
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,439
work a little bit you're practically

132
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,280
integrated

133
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,680
yeah i mean that's one of those things

134
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,359
that i think everyone is uh i guess

135
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,120
looking forward to doing is integrating

136
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,319
with metric and

137
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,079
currently

138
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:45,199
i would say the resources out there

139
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:47,198
aren't um aren't you know plenty enough

140
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,600
to to have everyone be on the same page

141
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,520
as to how to use this one api

142
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,160
um or and you know a lot of people

143
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:56,079
frankly right now are using uh are just

144
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,040
emailing in their manifest for track and

145
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,639
trace

146
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,120
i think that's the most common way that

147
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,400
people are abiding by these laws

148
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,399
and in addition

149
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,079
i think you know the the metric

150
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,198
compliance is really enforced once you

151
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,639
get your annual license and currently

152
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,560
most people are still operating under

153
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,120
their temporary provisional licenses and

154
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,879
so um that's something that everyone is

155
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,959
it's top of mind right now i think it's

156
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:22,319
really important to discuss um just

157
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:25,120
because uh you know in order to continue

158
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,478
operating compliantly uh moving forward

159
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,079
um once everyone gets their annual

160
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,478
licenses we all need to be on the same

161
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,478
page about how to use this technology to

162
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,918
you know comply with state laws

163
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,680
so so

164
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:36,879
what we aim to do is to talk very

165
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,639
briefly and then open it up for

166
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,439
questions by the way so if you got a

167
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,439
metric hot pants you get get near nagaio

168
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,038
to get your question in

169
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,519
so i think uh one thing that i was

170
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:50,000
pitching to you guys is that

171
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:52,560
for hardware you have to tune you build

172
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,360
hardware to separate solid and fluid for

173
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,280
avocados and shale oil or whatever but

174
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,400
when you when you you had to recalibrate

175
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,719
it for cannabis can you tell us

176
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,478
something about what you had to do there

177
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,800
yeah so just taking our uh our

178
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:08,079
experience in the other industries the

179
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,240
the base basic science of it is is sound

180
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:12,879
and goes across the industries but the

181
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,560
specifics about how to handle that the

182
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:16,639
the individual cannabis plants how to

183
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,800
automate that how to move it from one

184
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,038
place to the other how to integrate with

185
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,800
matrix how to develop software within

186
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:24,159
our within our platform that will

187
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,600
actually track

188
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,319
all the lot numbers and everything

189
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,319
seamlessly because our our goal is to

190
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,479
have you know a fully automated plant

191
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,160
that really a guy considered a control

192
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:35,918
panel and can operate and can produce

193
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,280
these products and so there's a lot of

194
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:38,639
things to think about especially on the

195
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,399
compliance side and things like that and

196
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,478
make sure that the software and hardware

197
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,560
can work together to ultimately meet

198
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,240
that goal i guess i was trying i was

199
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,680
also fishing for like an image of you

200
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,439
going from like

201
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,439
oil dripping off your hands to like

202
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,279
handling soft buds or like the

203
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,719
transformation in your sort of the

204
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,638
materials you were handling you have

205
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,319
stories about that or something no not

206
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,079
really this uh you know working in the

207
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,160
oil field it uh it's a it's a

208
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,839
challenging career for sure moving

209
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,439
around from platform to platform and

210
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,279
looking at those things and

211
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:10,000
there was just an opportunity we were we

212
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:12,000
were up in canada doing some blp testing

213
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,038
it was snowing it was colder than you

214
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,038
can believe

215
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:17,120
and uh things were freezing up and

216
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,800
anyway we were riding along and and it

217
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,319
was just at that moment that we decided

218
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,680
man this is not really what we want to

219
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,280
be doing and we had been looking into

220
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,360
the cannabis industry and and really

221
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,758
wanted to make that that change and so

222
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,840
so we moved out and did it yeah and so

223
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,680
for the guys on the software end of

224
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:34,478
things we were talking a bit about

225
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,240
whether you know so i'm the chief

226
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,240
technology officer of bud.com i

227
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,560
qualified for this business by smoking

228
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,280
weed and also loving the internet and

229
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,560
registering bud.com 25 years ago i

230
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,478
started coming to this conference four

231
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,478
years ago and networking until i met

232
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:49,758
somebody who could help me make a real

233
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:51,439
thing out of the thing and now we

234
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,840
deliver pot so if you like marijuana

235
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:56,959
we'll bring it to you homes or hotels

236
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:59,439
bud.com fired up california

237
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,598
but basically um you know we when we

238
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,839
went to build our platform we could not

239
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:06,079
use commercial software packages that

240
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,918
regular internet startups could use can

241
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,758
use payment methods we couldn't use

242
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,120
e-commerce shops we couldn't use crm

243
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,280
packages we couldn't use billing

244
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,840
packages i mean advertising packages it

245
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:18,878
was like it was like the the

246
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,159
startup special ops experimental extreme

247
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,439
course i couldn't even believe it

248
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,720
because i've been in software for 20

249
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,319
years but it's like how about if you

250
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,479
just take all the building blocks you

251
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,919
have that you use to make a company and

252
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:29,359
you remove them all so you have to start

253
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,918
from scratch and do all your own stuff

254
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,560
it really makes an honest sort of uh you

255
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,639
know producer out of you wow uh all that

256
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,799
is to say that i thought maybe in a few

257
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:41,038
years cannabis will be legal you know

258
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,359
and if president ivanka trump will

259
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,199
legalize it and we'll all be allowed to

260
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,278
use whatever software we want and the

261
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,720
people making specialized cannabis

262
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,639
software will kind of disappear because

263
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,000
we'll all just be inhaled into some

264
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,838
giant erp but you guys were disagreeing

265
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,200
yeah i would say um you know it's it's a

266
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,800
common question that we get asked

267
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,480
actually is you know why can't you just

268
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,319
take an off-the-shelf erp system and

269
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,360
start using it for yourself and i think

270
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,120
one of the main

271
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,399
enterprise resource planning so right

272
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,639
right sorry a lot of three-letter

273
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,919
acronyms in the tech world but um you

274
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,199
know essentially

275
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,199
i think the main reason is because

276
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,680
there's a lot of compliance uh and

277
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,920
regulatory reasons um for instance for

278
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,599
us like we have to bake into

279
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:21,919
our system automating how to generate

280
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,320
manifests you know testing and all that

281
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,240
sort of stuff tracking um and you know

282
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,200
again abiding by metric compliance

283
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,720
standards

284
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,360
and so those are all things that your

285
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,600
typical off-the-shelf um you know erp

286
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,039
system doesn't come with um and so we

287
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,399
had to build a lot of that in-house and

288
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,079
i think a lot of the other

289
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,559
operators in the industry like who over

290
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,399
here with meadow is is doing himself too

291
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,079
um and i'm sure you know it sounds like

292
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,159
you ran to the same issue and i think

293
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,000
the next step for all the kind of

294
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,278
software operators in this industry is

295
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,839
really to

296
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,439
you know put all the pieces together um

297
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,040
in a way that

298
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,440
we're currently at least we have

299
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,120
software for the industry now um the

300
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,200
next step is really to make those

301
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,278
identifiers for the packages for all the

302
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,600
products unified um to have like a

303
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:07,519
universal system from seed to sale you

304
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,200
know all the tracking because otherwise

305
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,799
when you pass products from one licensed

306
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,800
entity to another you get a lot of

307
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,159
mismatch of data and the data integrity

308
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,159
becomes poor

309
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,519
so i think that's the next step for us i

310
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,719
think there's a lot of people home

311
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,399
growing their own software and it's

312
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,399
really great for the industry

313
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,839
but that's just v1 i think v2 is really

314
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,639
getting everyone to be on the same page

315
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,839
about

316
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,240
how we interact with each other's

317
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,160
systems

318
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,278
i i think you said everything was great

319
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,000
there dude

320
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,919
yeah um yeah only thing i would add to

321
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,440
that is you know we talked about a lot

322
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:40,479
of change that's happened in the last

323
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,720
year and last couple decades

324
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,200
you know i don't think traditional

325
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,560
companies can move as quickly to adjust

326
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,680
with what's going on and they don't

327
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,439
really care

328
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,078
you know do they care about the excise

329
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,240
tax probably not i care a lot about the

330
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,639
excise tax you know as much as everyone

331
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,799
here do they care about integrating lab

332
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,000
tests to understand the potency levels

333
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,278
for the consumer because that makes them

334
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,839
a more educated buyer not not yet

335
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:08,159
it's too still too small for them and

336
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,720
i think if you think about you know will

337
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,719
we be

338
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,879
commoditized into this other realm in 10

339
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,399
years i don't think so i think

340
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,799
there are going to be some best-in-class

341
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,399
companies that come out of this uh that

342
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,679
will be as big as some of the other

343
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,480
operators there because just like

344
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,799
alcohol or tobacco or pharmaceuticals or

345
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,600
food or you know organic food and

346
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,838
subsectors cannabis will have its own

347
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,360
you know thing uh because of the laws

348
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,800
and the nuances of it not just at a

349
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,200
local and a state level we're going to

350
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:41,039
do state to state you know eventually

351
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,399
we're going to be doing global

352
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:44,719
if you look at just

353
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,399
shipping across different countries and

354
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,560
the tariffs and all that stuff that has

355
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,200
to be built in i mean do you know what

356
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:53,278
the regs are going to be in

357
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,278
in colombia when we're going to be

358
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,879
shipping and exporting and importing

359
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:58,240
from from them

360
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,159
it's going to still have to get worked

361
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,000
out and i think that because of that the

362
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,000
people that are on the ground here that

363
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,278
are with us here today i mean we're all

364
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,879
going to be able to collaborate and work

365
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,360
together and move this thing

366
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,879
way farther than anybody coming in from

367
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,079
the outside that's just trying to gobble

368
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,679
it up

369
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:16,239
so i was i asked the moderator of the

370
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,000
last panel lauren frazier hey uh what

371
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,440
could tech do for the cannabis industry

372
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,799
and she said ah

373
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,079
there's a problem that you guys could

374
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,319
solve

375
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,159
digitization

376
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,560
people are still using paper

377
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:31,439
i was like oh my god paper

378
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,799
yeah so anyway well we've got a question

379
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,800
we're ready for questions what's that

380
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,319
yeah we have to use paper

381
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:37,919
yeah we have to use paper in some places

382
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,440
but i think some people are using paper

383
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,159
when they could be using like

384
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,959
spreadsheets or computers or email or

385
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,719
you know for sure chat or whatever

386
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,319
yeah it's part of the

387
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,320
part of the challenge while everyone's

388
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,600
on a temporary license and then we're

389
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,920
going to move into provisionals and then

390
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,879
provisionals will have the the metric

391
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,360
mandate

392
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,240
you know i think

393
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,320
for

394
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,240
there is going to be a crossing to the

395
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,079
digital side but it's still going to be

396
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,320
a little bit painful too

397
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,399
but hopefully we can lose less trees

398
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,760
yeah we have painkillers to go with it

399
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,200
you ready for questions yeah we're ready

400
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,439
for questions first of all i'd like to

401
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,639
say that you have to use papers or how

402
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,639
else would you roll a joint

403
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,320
with your digits digitally

404
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,320
all right enter introduce yourself and

405
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,079
say what your situation is

406
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,600
my name is mitchell and hold the mic

407
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:28,638
close to your face my name is mitchell

408
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,879
colbert

409
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,000
my name is mitchell colbert i'm a

410
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:33,759
lobbyist currently working on the

411
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,679
cannabis e-waste issue

412
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,439
my question is while it is tech related

413
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,799
is not related to that you're talking

414
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,320
about the issues of having to build

415
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:41,679
everything yourself

416
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,959
as i'm sure everyone in this room knows

417
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,638
mj freeway has been hacked many times mj

418
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,638
freeway is one of the big pos systems

419
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,639
out there do you think there's security

420
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,320
risks present in forcing every business

421
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,399
to reinvent the wheel potentially

422
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,320
leaving back doors and security flaws in

423
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,039
there rather than using tested and true

424
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,560
technology used in other industries

425
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,559
well i mean i'd like to think that the

426
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,159
technology we use is at least as good as

427
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,559
the technology used by the political

428
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,639
parties of our country and the banks and

429
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,919
the you know major consumer brands what

430
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,079
do you think i hope you're not banging

431
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,519
with wells fargo

432
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,359
yeah i mean i think if you look at

433
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,799
modern technology companies today

434
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,839
they're not building you know

435
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:22,000
co-location servers uh by themselves and

436
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,480
putting resources there they're using

437
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,120
aws or heroku that already have

438
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,480
enterprise grade solutions and

439
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,919
encryption

440
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,000
i think if you don't implement those

441
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:35,120
solutions then you're also at a risk of

442
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,759
exposing yourself to you know hacks uh

443
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,240
so best in class should be you know

444
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:43,439
utilizing third party in a way that has

445
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,360
those protections in place

446
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,920
yeah sure um i mean i think as far as

447
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,519
security goes um i think this is just

448
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,958
goes for software in general is that

449
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,198
it's something that

450
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:55,198
improves over time as you maintain it

451
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:57,198
more um i can't imagine you know

452
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,278
microsoft started with their old first

453
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:00,479
computer with the best security

454
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:02,159
primitives

455
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,920
out there and it's something that as

456
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,240
they reach more and more issues it's

457
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:08,479
they did a lot of patches and it is

458
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,680
where it is today um but you know it's

459
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,000
something that

460
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:13,439
for us i think with the v1 level

461
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,799
software that we have currently in the

462
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,399
industry

463
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,799
i'm sure there are a lot of security

464
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,240
issues going on that people can lose

465
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:21,679
their data over

466
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,159
but i think over time it's something

467
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:26,479
that you know we'll have more bandwidth

468
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,519
frankly to pay attention to and in

469
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,039
addition

470
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,919
you know more more capital more

471
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:34,000
resources to apply um so i think i think

472
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,439
it'll fix itself over time you know when

473
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,759
i first attended this conference i was

474
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,040
alone i was a lonely nerd wanderer i was

475
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,759
sort of walking around being like i got

476
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:43,919
this web domain i like computers you

477
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,440
like weed let's smoke

478
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:46,958
but then it's like

479
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,880
i just can't realize oh i have an

480
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,799
offering i could i could try and make

481
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,958
the weed world more nerdy because when i

482
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,879
think about security holes in the weed

483
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,638
business it's going into a potential

484
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,159
dispensary partner and seeing the like

485
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,919
the gmail address for the entire

486
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,159
dispensary operation and the password

487
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:04,000
written on a post-it that's posted up

488
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,600
above the computer i mean that's like

489
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
you talk about like you need enterprise

490
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,759
great security and your aws you know

491
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,360
cloud server but you also need the

492
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,919
people on your premises to sort of have

493
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,480
some basic digital literacy maybe even

494
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,759
splurge on like a password manager you

495
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,440
know i mean i think there's a lot of

496
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,959
ways in which the weed industry could

497
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,279
use some consumer grade uh tech tools to

498
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:28,078
really you know i it's tough you gotta

499
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:30,799
say that the the culture of security

500
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,479
yeah is pertains to the technical world

501
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:34,399
too and not just you know when talking

502
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,480
about women and human factors right i

503
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,480
mean if somebody leaves your enterprise

504
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,920
and you've got one password across your

505
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,079
16 accounts like you lost your instagram

506
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,679
somebody just lose 200 million dollars

507
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:48,239
because the guy who ran off with the

508
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,719
money died yeah and he has the only

509
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,240
password yes that's right yeah there's

510
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,320
great adventure out there but there's

511
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,919
digital literacy that i think will

512
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,600
could could you know there's a lot of

513
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,278
times when i go into business i'm trying

514
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,040
to help them understand how bud.com

515
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:02,639
could deliver for them and what i really

516
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,480
want to do is give them like a two-hour

517
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,558
it consultation to be like you should

518
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,400
try google docs it'll be amazing what

519
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:09,439
collaborative spreadsheets could do for

520
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,959
your work

521
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,079
did you have a question yeah stand up

522
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,959
and introduce yourself uh i'm jordan uh

523
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:17,359
we're

524
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,120
starting out in the utah market um so

525
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,078
that's also

526
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,719
yeah

527
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:26,078
partially uh where where my question

528
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,919
lies is starting out from

529
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,519
really the ground up

530
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,480
what's the best way to stay cost

531
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,319
effective in our tracking um i mean as

532
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,360
far as compliance goes i mean utah is

533
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,439
not going to be any different than

534
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:40,079
arkansas and all those other places that

535
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,798
have really heavily regulated

536
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,519
uh religious markets and whatnot

537
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,639
so

538
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:48,639
thinking rfid tracking to blockchain is

539
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,960
that where we're ending up

540
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,440
gonna are we getting to that point where

541
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,160
thank you thank you it took uh 18

542
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,840
minutes before somebody said blockchain

543
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,519
um i was thinking we were going to be

544
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,359
more supply chain than blockchain but i

545
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,519
think you know blockchain is this idea

546
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,759
you create a ledger that everybody can

547
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:08,240
see and it including the feds

548
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,839
yes yes because the feds is us man we

549
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,640
are the government isn't that isn't that

550
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:14,319
the dream so anyway you inscribe the

551
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,919
characteristics of the cannabis in this

552
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,599
ledger that everybody can see and so

553
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,759
it's sort of track and traceable in

554
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,279
perpetuity man you got a lot of work to

555
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,839
do in utah before you try and make

556
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:25,359
blockchain on the cannabis i mean wow

557
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,199
what do you guys what do you anybody got

558
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,599
something to say on this thing yeah i

559
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,200
mean i think with all startups

560
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:32,639
it's not necessarily the tools too it's

561
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,480
just how you guys communicate and work

562
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,480
together to keep costs low

563
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,038
um i know when we were bootstrapping

564
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,240
meadow we lived in our apartments we

565
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:41,279
went to each other's apartments for

566
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,400
office

567
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:46,079
we cooked just rice and meat and just

568
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,440
that was our dinner together like just

569
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,599
bring costs down

570
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,120
um you know when it topped software you

571
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:55,119
know we had one user that we all shared

572
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:56,959
so we didn't have to pay extra user

573
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:59,279
receipts you know stuff like that where

574
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,038
you just still do that yeah

575
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,200
you know i think there's ways around

576
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:05,599
where you can cut costs yes but still

577
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,519
invest in in best practices to make

578
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,240
things more efficient

579
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,599
oh for me in those areas i think when

580
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,480
you have

581
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:13,839
more

582
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,599
things that

583
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:17,519
more resources oftentimes you're not as

584
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,199
creative so having less resources you

585
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,798
tend to be a little bit more

586
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,960
conscious with every dollar that you

587
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:25,279
have and then every minute that you have

588
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,120
um i think ultimately though you need to

589
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,200
build something that people want right

590
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:31,199
you need to go and this is sort of our

591
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,640
yc mantra you go and talk to the

592
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,440
customer what's yc uh y combinator yeah

593
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,520

oh sorry y combinator guys you you

595
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:40,798

596
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,759
planet cannabis right so they don't know

597
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,720
what this is yeah yeah y combinator is

598
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:47,599
uh

599
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,519
an incubator fund accelerator community

600
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:51,678
of entrepreneurs who

601
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,679
have started a lot of some of the

602
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,080
biggest companies that you know in tech

603
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,880
dropbox airbnb

604
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,918
weebly coinbase i mean the list goes on

605
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,000
and on

606
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:05,360
but what's really great about it is

607
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,480
they have a set of

608
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:08,479
mantras

609
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,839
that you know you should follow and one

610
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,880
of them is make something that people

611
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:15,119
want and it's so crucial i think a lot

612
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,840
of times everyone's still stuck in their

613
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:20,719
apartment or at a coffee shop saying i'm

614
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:22,399
doing work i'm doing the thing but who

615
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,919
they should really be or what they

616
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,679
should really be spending time is going

617
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,840
to the dispensary if that's your your

618
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,280
partner go and talk to them work on

619
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:30,480
closing out stuff at the end of the day

620
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,158
if you're working with a brand or a

621
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,200
manufacturer and you're doing marketing

622
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,080
go and

623
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,840
to their shop and talk to them um

624
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,839
there's not enough of that you can you

625
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:41,439
know there's people that have fancy

626
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,678
equipment on the photography side you

627
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,440
guys are amazing but if you don't have a

628
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,280
zoom lens just take your phone and go

629
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,840
all the way up front to the person right

630
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,839
like there's stuff like that where

631
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:53,119
that type of mantra is important while

632
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,678
you're building your company but it's

633
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,119
exciting utah is great so go for it let

634
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,880
me ask let me ask lee do you have any

635
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:00,558
advice for people who are trying to who

636
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,559
have a hardware idea and how they can

637
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:04,158
experiment and innovate and well what i

638
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:05,839
would say is that if you are starting up

639
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,360
a business that just like they said you

640
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,959
should identify the product that you

641
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,199
ultimately want to produce as a product

642
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,038
obviously that somebody wants to buy and

643
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,038
then you all talk

644
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,240
exactly and then you also ought to do

645
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:17,599
your homework to make sure that the

646
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,279
equipment that you're that you are

647
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:21,359
purchasing is the equipment that will

648
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:23,119
produce that end result for you and that

649
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:24,319
you don't have to go and rebuy equipment

650
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:26,959
and start all over when you haven't

651
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:28,639
gotten it right

652
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,679
see there you go that's it

653
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,960
okay

654
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,120
all right we got one right here here we

655
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,120
go

656
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,279
hey there my name is eric i'm built yeah

657
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,038
right up on there my name is eric i'm

658
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:43,599
building a

659
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:46,158
my name is eric

660
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:48,480
am building a data company for genetics

661
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,559
in cannabis and i'm curious on what the

662
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,200
industry's perception is for data

663
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:53,200
privacy

664
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,120
so you're basically building like a data

665
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:00,399
warehouse for all the different types of

666
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:02,079
23andme but for cannabis

667
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,200
where i upload my dna and it tells me

668
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,199
what i should vape

669
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,678
sort of i could clarify more to you

670
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:13,519
later if you want

671
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:16,240
yeah i think the you know data is still

672
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:18,400
uh an early topic on on how it's you

673
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,159
know being talked about um but i think

674
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,080
for for your business you should talk

675
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,280
with labs you know they're seeing a lot

676
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:24,558
of the data they're doing all the

677
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,319
testing uh see if you can do a

678
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:28,158
partnership there that makes a lot of

679
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:31,200
sense to me i mean steep hill has a big

680
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,600
one a big repository of dna that they've

681
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,600
sequenced apparently um

682
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:37,439
philos is another group

683
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,359
so you know there are resources there

684
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,279
where instead of like tap you can just

685
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,399
tap into it if they're they're open to

686
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:43,599
it

687
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,840
i mean are you talking about data

688
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:47,839
privacy like this is my private strain

689
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,480
well that sounds like the intellectual

690
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:53,599
property that's an intellectual property

691
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,960
thing and that's definitely a thing

692
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:57,038
that's going to be in the future right

693
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,640
somebody's going to try to patent train

694
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:00,558
wreck or claim they were the first

695
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,360
person to invent bubba kush

696
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:04,879
or acapulco gold it'll be nagayo wreck

697
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:09,000
and then you can guys that's right i'm

698
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,000
going to slip and fall in the grow room

699
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:13,440
thank you thank you the three people

700
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,199
thank you call saul did you have a

701
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,279
question

702
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,880
my name is peter here to learn uh what

703
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:20,558
do you think what do you think the

704
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,960
biggest threats are to your software

705
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:24,639
businesses is it competitors coming in

706
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,360
from other industries that you know

707
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,000
might have a pre-established erp or you

708
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:31,439
know crm or pos system uh what do you

709
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,599
see as some of the biggest threats to

710
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,640
your to your software businesses let's

711
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:40,240
let's make it inclusive okay can we say

712
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,000
hardware okay hardware yep okay um i

713
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,679
would say i think you hit a couple of

714
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,519
those one is you know if someone else

715
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,519
were to go build the same thing with

716
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,359
more money and more resources you know

717
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,679
that's obviously a threat

718
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:54,240
the other i think that is probably more

719
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,960
top of mind more top of mind is probably

720
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,200
the changing rules and regulations

721
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,600
that happen pretty frequently

722
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,919
it it causes us to i mean the reason why

723
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,519
we in-house our software is because for

724
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,520
just that reason it'd be pretty tough to

725
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,200
rely on like a third party

726
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:10,960
you know software provider software

727
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,600
contracting firm

728
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,278
to build out what we need just because

729
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,519
our operations have to morph every

730
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:19,359
single time these new regs come out and

731
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,839
you know the partners that we work with

732
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,759
also are startups and they change the

733
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:26,000
way that they operate and so we have to

734
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,599
be able to be nimble and adapt and um

735
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,919
you know having our own software really

736
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,359
helps with that um and yeah i mean i

737
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,360
think as far as like other players

738
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:34,798
coming in and building the same thing

739
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,599
i don't think they'd be able to do it

740
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:40,480
unless they ran their own infrastructure

741
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:43,119
um and and understood really like for us

742
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,400
uh distribution um and so yeah those are

743
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:47,359
the kinds of things that we see as

744
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,440
threats but we're wary of

745
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:50,639
yeah just a couple points on that uh

746
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,720
you know

747
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,159
another mantra out there is don't worry

748
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,519
about competitors

749
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,960
right

750
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:59,278
keep your nose to the grindstone and

751
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,519
just run your own race

752
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:03,200
oftentimes i find that some operators

753
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,359
keep looking left and right and they're

754
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,360
doing something and then they pivot to

755
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:08,879
go build something that's just like

756
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:10,479
shittier than what they did anyway

757
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,240
instead of just focusing on what they

758
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,480
they should have done

759
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,038
so oftentimes like self-sabotage is a

760
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,240
threat because of the lack of focus or

761
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:20,400
just looking at other things that are

762
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,720
going on you know with the with cannabis

763
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,000
regulations is definitely

764
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,200
a threat it could be actually an

765
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,599
opportunity

766
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,558
right if you look at products out there

767
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,599
you're creating a moat and regulations

768
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:33,278
is a moat

769
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:34,879
this regulatory mode that you have to

770
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:37,200
navigate through

771
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,360
and being participatory within that

772
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,278
regulatory process is a unique

773
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:42,959
opportunity that we have right now the

774
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:44,558
cement is still wet

775
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,200
right we have the laws it's still wet

776
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:49,359
but we still have ability to uh advocate

777
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,038
on the legislative side and you know

778
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,678
give our feedback to the regulators to

779
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:55,839
create better better laws

780
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,919
you know we did a our first push to

781
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:59,599
metric yesterday with one of our

782
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,080
licensed operators

783
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:04,639
and you know we were able to help that

784
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:06,480
by you know i'm on the board the ccia

785
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,320
i'm the board of the cda by talking

786
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,400
about you know getting a hand with them

787
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:12,319
and commenting and sharing the feedback

788
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,720
that they don't get to see in order to

789
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:17,038
help move this process along

790
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,120
so i think it's incredibly important to

791
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:20,720
look at these threats not necessarily

792
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,639
threat as an opportunity to kind of you

793
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,200
know reframe your thinking and how you

794
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,200
move forward to be

795
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,360
uh the best version of yourself and your

796
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,360
company as you kind of evolve

797
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:32,879
and and i'll tell you briefly if if all

798
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:34,399
of hua's dreams come true in the

799
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,240
regulations people listen and they

800
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,278
legalize and it all happened and

801
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,839
weeds on sale in walgreens by next week

802
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:43,599
that would be tough for our business

803
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,959
i mean that'd be a very accelerated

804
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,759
timeline

805
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,120
next week yeah yeah yeah you have the

806
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:50,640
existential threats your business you

807
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:52,319
want to share with us yeah i think the

808
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,919
threats to the manufacturing side are

809
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,759
just that the rules and regulations will

810
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,120
get out in front of the technology to be

811
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:58,720
able to produce those products that can

812
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,158
come comply with those rules and

813
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,679
regulations and so

814
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,120
just uh being able to meet the real

815
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,240
stringent testing requirements and

816
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:05,839
things like that when you're trying to

817
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,599
run a fully automated process can be

818
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:08,798
difficult so hopefully they'll kind of

819
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:09,918
rain those in a little bit and we'll be

820
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:11,679
able to go

821
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,360
go ahead and process

822
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,480
great thank you we don't have any more

823
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:18,398
time i'm sorry it is no it is the time

824
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,960
but yeah but don't leave let's hear it

825
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:23,959
from the panel first of all let's hear

826
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,960
it's fantastic
