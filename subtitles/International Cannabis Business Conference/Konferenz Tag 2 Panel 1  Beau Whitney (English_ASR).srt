1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,259
well thanks everybody

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:08,519
um good morning I just want to start off

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:10,740
by thanking ICBC for inviting me to to

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,120
speak I think this is my fifth or sixth

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,219
time here

6
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:17,160
um today I'm going to talk about some of

7
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:19,198
the economics of of cannabis I'm first

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,778
going to talk a little bit

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,640
about

10
00:00:20,778 --> 00:00:26,100
the global market and then the US market

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,740
and then uh do a little bit of a deep

12
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,599
dive into the German Market

13
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,039
um so

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,759
um a little bit about Whitney economics

15
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:38,700
we're a global leader in business data

16
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:41,759
economic research as well as Consulting

17
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,559
both in the adult use and Medical Market

18
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,659
but also in the in the industrial

19
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:47,699
cannabis or hemp Market

20
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:49,319
um and so we have clientele all over

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,940
the world and practically every

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,719
continent except for of course

23
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,500
Antarctica we're trying but uh

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,340
um

25
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,320
so in terms of the global Marketplace

26
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,140
there's over 70 countries now that have

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,938
some form of access to cannabis either

28
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:11,460
adult use medical or some type of

29
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:12,199
cannabinoids CBD

30
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:16,459
Etc

31
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,960
and the reason for this reform

32
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:20,938
is different from country to Country to

33
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:25,019
Country some want Economic Development

34
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:26,719
someone access and re to medicines some

35
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:30,239
people want Alternatives

36
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,859
but those reform is taking an

37
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,259
accelerated Pace now

38
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:37,500
I mean so it's good to see

39
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,239
um in on a combined basis the Cannabis

40
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,019
industry is about a trillion dollar

41
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:45,899
Global industry a lot of this is driven

42
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:49,978
by Industrial Hemp but then you've also

43
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:53,960
got the medical and adult use and so

44
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:57,239
it's about one-third cannabis two-thirds

45
00:01:53,959 --> 00:02:01,500
hemp and

46
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:04,379
um so right now the U.S is driving a lot

47
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,560
of the narrative they're driving the the

48
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:08,598
policies at the UN level

49
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,420
International

50
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:13,919
but the market in the United States is

51
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,859
so dysfunctional

52
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,439
that there's a possibility that the

53
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,739
European

54
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:25,318
blog could displace the U.S as a global

55
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:28,580
leader in driving direction and reform

56
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:28,579
uh globally

57
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:34,860
and so here's a U.S update what we did

58
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:37,859
here is we've tracked the the U.S market

59
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,959
and then we projected out the growth a

60
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,120
lot of the growth is coming from the new

61
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,479
markets that are deploying

62
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:49,219
um last year surprisingly to some 10

63
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:51,598
states out of the you know 38 that are

64
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:52,620
have deployed some type of legal

65
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,018
cannabis

66
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,500
10 states actually showed negative

67
00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:00,959
growth and so but nonetheless overall

68
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,019
the market eked out some some growth

69
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,319
we're forecasting 12 growth this year

70
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:09,180
and then it should really take off by

71
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:11,458
2025.

72
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,519
um the reason for the sluggish growth

73
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:17,819
last year was that there was a return to

74
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,560
work a return to school people didn't

75
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:23,399
have as much opportunity to consume

76
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:26,219
cannabis and as a result of that the

77
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,739
demand shifted back down to pre-covered

78
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:30,560
levels and then there was a change in

79
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:35,099
consumer Behavior

80
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,500
typically in the U.S the consumer would

81
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:39,299
spend about the same amount each time

82
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,120
that they go to a dispensary or retail

83
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,319
outlet but with all the narrative about

84
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,620
inflation

85
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:49,199
about potential recessions and like

86
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,759
um they write in the August September

87
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,899
time frame they pulled back their

88
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:53,759
spending

89
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,519
um and there was a downward shift in the

90
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,560
basket amount that they spent each time

91
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,680
that they go to the to the retail outlet

92
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,080
and so that really impacted the market

93
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,599
and took down

94
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,180
um you know the overall demand now even

95
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:12,539
with that our forecast accuracy was 93

96
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,780
so we didn't do that bad of a job it was

97
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:17,699
98 the year before so we have a pretty

98
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,079
good pulse on what's going on in the U.S

99
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,280
market

100
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,139
um but

101
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,638
um we're not going to going to see much

102
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:27,418
growth

103
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:30,680
um you know in the you know until 2025

104
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:30,680
and then it'll really take off

105
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,019
so

106
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,960
um you know we we've forecasted the

107
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:42,299
European market on a total addressable

108
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:45,478
Market basis this is the total number of

109
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,060
consumers elicit legal it doesn't matter

110
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:51,779
and then we applied a spending pattern

111
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,459
to that and then we projected out what

112
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:55,079
the total demand is

113
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,539
um it's a pretty sizable Market it's

114
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:00,659
actually the second largest market

115
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,540
um by spends but it's you know a pretty

116
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:06,419
small Market relative to you know other

117
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:09,300
markets like Africa or Asia

118
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:13,039
um but there there's a lot of

119
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:17,819
examination of reforms a lot of interest

120
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:20,100
and if the German market and the Czech

121
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:23,279
market and their policies if they team

122
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,979
up then they could really be the

123
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,939
Catalyst and further reform and growth

124
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:28,939
in the European market

125
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,360
so here's just a total addressable

126
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,639
Market it's a pretty sizable Market

127
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,560
five countries really dominate it may be

128
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,319
surprising that Italy is up there that's

129
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,478
based upon some un data that shows the

130
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,819
total number of consumers that actually

131
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:50,180
have used cannabis in the previous year

132
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:53,579
so they had higher consumption patterns

133
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,860
than in in other countries

134
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:58,918
um but nonetheless it's a real sizable

135
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:01,439
market and

136
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:04,560
um depending upon if you use the UN data

137
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,538
which has some limitations on it or if

138
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,060
you use our data we actually show that

139
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:11,659
there's more consumers than what the UN

140
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,660
is saying

141
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:16,860
um and also there's potential of 150

142
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:19,019
million consumers if you expand the

143
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,600
market out to like Russia and other

144
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:26,038
periphery countries within the EU

145
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,720
now back in 1850 little history lesson

146
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:30,659
um the Czech Republic and Germany got

147
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,639
together and they defined the the

148
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,600
regulations or standards for Pilsner

149
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,240
beer

150
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,520
and that became the de facto standard

151
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,160
for the rest of the world and there's an

152
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:42,959
opportunity here for Germany and the

153
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,259
Czech Republic who are both considering

154
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:48,478
reforms to do the same thing and set the

155
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:51,419
standard for the rest of Europe but

156
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,038
right now is there enough motivation

157
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:55,859
right now is there going to be a

158
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:58,740
champion Within These markets to do so

159
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:02,038
the jury's still out on that and

160
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:04,319
um you know from the briefings earlier

161
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:06,899
um or yesterday and the like

162
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,460
um it's there's a reason to be

163
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:11,120
optimistic and there's a reason to be

164
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:11,120
pessimistic

165
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:16,680
um now last year I presented some data

166
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,319
on what the ramp would look like if they

167
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:24,360
deployed full Federal legalization in

168
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:26,039
Germany and the um ramp actually was and

169
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,199
we look at things in terms of the

170
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:30,180
percentage of legal capture the amount

171
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,079
of participation in the legal markets

172
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,918
and like

173
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:37,079
and the the ramp scenario for Germany

174
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:38,579
last year was

175
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:41,459
um that they would have a greater

176
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:43,439
capture than the U.S but a little bit

177
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:45,359
less than Canada so a pretty successful

178
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,860
ramp

179
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,020
um that was based upon last year's

180
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,199
policies though and those policies have

181
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:54,839
since changed so the demand has been

182
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,759
significantly shifted downward the

183
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,459
percentage of legal participation has

184
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,439
been shifted downward as well and so

185
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:02,359
it's really cut the legs off of this

186
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,399
market

187
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,660
and so I think that's important when

188
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:08,219
you're looking at this from a business

189
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:12,060
perspective and you're trying to find

190
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:14,220
where the opportunities are to see this

191
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,519
potential growth last year and now not

192
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,500
so much then it really plays a role in

193
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,519
your decision making on Market entry

194
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,519
strategies and the like

195
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:26,639
and so here's an a revenue projection

196
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:28,500
and so

197
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,840
um you know I appreciate the the efforts

198
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,120
of metric and their presentation

199
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:34,439
um they did they do a really good job

200
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,120
um we take a little bit different

201
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,159
approach where we look at the legal

202
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,620
markets and we've mapped out all these

203
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:42,500
ramps and then we look at the regulatory

204
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:46,980
structures in each one of these markets

205
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:49,740
and the as a result of this shift to the

206
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:53,339
Social Clubs it's really

207
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:55,200
um pulled down the potential forecasts

208
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:57,959
through 2030

209
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,820
um and so for example this is roughly a

210
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:02,399
you know four billion dollar market by

211
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,260
2030. it's now an 800 million dollar

212
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:09,080
market so that's a pretty significant

213
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:09,080
haircut just based upon policies

214
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,200
um I think it's important to note also

215
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,860
that

216
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,600
um

217
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,519
you know although there's been a

218
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,740
downward shift in the market

219
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,259
um in the market projections

220
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:25,080
um one has to be prepared for another

221
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:28,980
shift another pivot in this space and

222
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:31,080
really be ready to ramp at a rapid Pace

223
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,360
um so in terms of German Supply

224
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,879
requirements so

225
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,940
um the total addressable Market requires

226
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:41,338
you know about 950

227
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,019
000 kilos of cultivated output and

228
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:45,660
that's output that's required for not

229
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:47,639
only flower and pre-rolls but for your

230
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:51,778
Edibles and your tinctures and your

231
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:54,080
extracts and all that so 950 000

232
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:57,000
um it's a pretty sizable Market

233
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,920
but as we can see

234
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,740
there's really

235
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:04,199
there's I don't think right now at this

236
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:07,500
point that there's enough capacity

237
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:12,120
online to support the demand even at the

238
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:14,100
lower numbers and so the orange was the

239
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,560
um the ramp scenario from last year and

240
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,480
the requirements and at that time I said

241
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,338
I put out some warnings to the German

242
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,778
government and I said hey look I don't

243
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,940
think you have enough capacity and it's

244
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:26,338
going to take time to ramp and you're

245
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,019
going to inhibit your growth and the

246
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:31,519
amount of conversion of the consumers

247
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:34,500
but even with the lower downward

248
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,799
revisions based upon the Social Clubs

249
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,379
I'm still skeptical that there's enough

250
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:42,240
capacity online

251
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:45,778
to support you know this this potential

252
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,200
ramp but we'll see I mean the jury's

253
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,200
still out

254
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:55,320
so implications so with a slower rollout

255
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:58,139
the business opportunities are smaller

256
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,000
um but there's still opportunities there

257
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:03,059
and so you really have to be strategic

258
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,120
and use data in order to ascertain where

259
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:09,059
the markets are what the potential are

260
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,100
and then be prepared to scale and

261
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:12,619
because of the fact that there's a

262
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,360
limited amount of Supply

263
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,120
you know there's opportunities there to

264
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,879
to fill that void

265
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:24,120
and the success of a regulated rollout

266
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:26,820
depends upon three variables there's

267
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,339
Supply if you have enough Supply and if

268
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,860
you have enough Supply then prices are

269
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:34,440
moderate they come down it incentivizes

270
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,019
a consumer the consumers are very price

271
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,579
dependent they're they look at price and

272
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:41,159
they'll participate in the legal Market

273
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:43,078
if there's an incentive to do so they're

274
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,819
willing to pay a premium

275
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:47,458
um just as long as the premium is not

276
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,379
too much and so price is another one of

277
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:52,018
those factors that plays a role and the

278
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:55,320
amount of legal participation and then

279
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:59,039
access and so if you have a lot of

280
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,959
retail outlets there's a lot of legal

281
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:03,599
participation and so if you have a

282
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:06,059
reasonable product a lot of access you

283
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,420
have reasonable Supply then that's a

284
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,139
successful scenario for a launch but if

285
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:13,259
you

286
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:15,720
a regulatory rollout so but if you don't

287
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:17,879
have one or two of those factors then

288
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,440
it's going to be problematic and it'll

289
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:22,439
it won't

290
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,420
um eliminate the legal conversions by

291
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,540
consumers it'll just slow it down

292
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:29,458
dramatically and so you know this could

293
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:33,480
turn very quickly so if you get more

294
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:37,078
access and more clubs and more retail

295
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,240
potential then there could be

296
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:41,639
um you know a quick turn in the in the

297
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,120
overall market and increased

298
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:44,120
opportunities

299
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,839
um so I'd be remiss if I didn't talk a

300
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,320
little bit about in the industrial side

301
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:55,440
of cannabis there's a strong Market in

302
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,800
the EU for industrial hemp I put

303
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,860
together this chart a while ago but it

304
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,479
still seems to resonate with people

305
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,639
there's applications in traditional

306
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,079
markets

307
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,980
to convert over to hemp on a more

308
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:14,519
sustainable basis a lot of um you know

309
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:16,200
incentives on the ESG side and so the

310
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,419
environment only friendly bringing in

311
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:21,959
more opportunities for minority

312
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:24,500
communities and the like and so even

313
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:27,838
with just a modest conversion

314
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,700
you know there's a lot of it's a sizable

315
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,760
market for in the industrial

316
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,820
applications now in Germany

317
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:38,278
you know there's the automotive industry

318
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:40,920
BMW already uses I think 20 of their

319
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:43,078
cars are made from Parts um derived from

320
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:45,000
hemp and so there's already this

321
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:46,919
conversion going on

322
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,078
um and this is could accelerate in the

323
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:52,439
area of fibers for construction

324
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:54,539
materials for plastic Replacements

325
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,579
plant-based Plastics and the like

326
00:13:54,539 --> 00:14:00,719
um and so there's a lot of potential to

327
00:13:56,578 --> 00:14:03,599
the hemp market and the EU right now is

328
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,440
kind of taking the lead displacing the

329
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,480
US they're taking the lead with regard

330
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,660
to hemp policy and so my firm has

331
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:15,120
country reports for 27 countries in in

332
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:18,659
Europe on the Cannabis Market looks at

333
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,360
rules and regulations on the industrial

334
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:23,659
side as well as adult use and medical

335
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,659
side

336
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,720
and so you know when it comes to

337
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,200
regulatory rollouts you know like I

338
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,660
mentioned price access

339
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,860
Supply it's really important to have

340
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:40,198
that

341
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,778
um and a lot of times Regulators will

342
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:45,120
copy and paste from other

343
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:47,578
um rollouts in other countries other

344
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,620
states and sometimes they bring in

345
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:51,120
policies that haven't worked in previous

346
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,560
markets

347
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,259
um and so it's really important to be

348
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:57,899
mindful when deploying the regulations

349
00:14:55,259 --> 00:15:00,439
to make sure that you meet multiple

350
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:03,360
goals such as Public Safety as well as

351
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:07,019
presenting and providing a good healthy

352
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:10,919
business environment but right now

353
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:14,399
There's an opportunity to displace the

354
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:16,679
U.S in terms of of cannabis policy but

355
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,659
it's going to take a little bit more

356
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:21,019
work by the federal Regulators in

357
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:21,019
Germany

358
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:29,759
and so in terms of the industry

359
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:31,799
um as as stakeholders in this space it's

360
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,659
really important to communicate not only

361
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:35,819
with Regulators but amongst yourselves

362
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:38,399
developed networks

363
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,500
um set expectations that are reasonable

364
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,078
relative to the market size and data

365
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,000
plays a real big role in that

366
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:47,458
um and you know don't get too far out

367
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,799
over your skis there's examples out of

368
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:52,319
Canada examples out of the United States

369
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:55,139
and other markets where they built too

370
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,540
much capacity didn't have enough and

371
00:15:55,139 --> 00:16:00,240
drove up their costs and the prices

372
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,799
crashed and they didn't have a good cost

373
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,820
control and so they weren't making any

374
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:07,859
money so it's really important to be

375
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:10,639
disciplined and look at your cost

376
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:13,740
structure and like it's also important

377
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,019
because cannabis is so localized

378
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:19,019
cannabis policy is so localized it's

379
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:21,480
important to act locally but to think on

380
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:25,198
a global basis for example in the United

381
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:29,220
States friends the cost per gram to

382
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:33,419
produce cannabis runs 25 cents to 50

383
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:37,259
cents a gram uh in some countries the

384
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:39,240
wholesale price is a pentagram and so as

385
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:43,139
soon as the international markets open

386
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:46,079
up this could be a serious threat to the

387
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:49,320
U.S market and so it's important to be

388
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:52,138
mindful of where you know things are

389
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,940
going on around the world just as much

390
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:57,139
as it's important to track things going

391
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,139
on locally

392
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:04,918
and so you know in terms of the future

393
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:07,318
if Germany does become the first Major

394
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:10,199
Market in Europe to roll this out

395
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:12,058
um uh they have a potential to really

396
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:15,539
shape the market

397
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:19,019
um even on the hemp side and but given

398
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:22,379
the fact that this is now home grow and

399
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:25,139
Social Clubs don't expect significant

400
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,179
increases in legal usage there's just

401
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,000
not going to be enough Supply there's

402
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:32,700
just not going to be enough access

403
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,079
but once policies change then there's

404
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,120
going to be an opportunity for

405
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:40,259
Accelerated growth so it's important to

406
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:41,939
plan for that time and I think also

407
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:45,599
there's an opportunity here for Canada

408
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:48,679
tourism people come to Germany to

409
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:51,538
consume in the clubs if they are able

410
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:56,220
and but that will be short-lived because

411
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:59,519
once reform takes hold across the EU

412
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,900
sector then they'll be less and less

413
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:04,019
kind of Tourism because they'll have

414
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,740
access to cannabis in their home country

415
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:07,679
um

416
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:10,798
and then also look for prices to really

417
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,038
normalize once the rollouts are complete

418
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:15,418
and once you get more capture because

419
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:18,900
initially because of the limited amount

420
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:22,259
of Supply you'll have you'll keep higher

421
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:26,100
prices and so once Supply normalizes and

422
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:28,200
is in equilibrium with the with the

423
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:29,699
demand then prices will normalize and

424
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,500
they'll ship downward it happens in

425
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,819
every Market

426
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,960
um

427
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:39,779
I think yeah so in some there's great

428
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,538
potential here uh there's a little less

429
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:45,119
potential than there was a year ago

430
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:47,339
um but uh you know who knows there could

431
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:51,000
be additional

432
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:53,220
um uh opportunities as uh things evolve

433
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,819
and so I just want to thank you again

434
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:59,880
here's my contact information

435
00:18:55,819 --> 00:19:02,279
we've got data on every country we ramp

436
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,980
the we look at ramps in every state

437
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:06,779
every country we have a lot of data a

438
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,220
lot of insights and so happy to help you

439
