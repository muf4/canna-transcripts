1
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:12,160
hello good afternoon

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:15,200
[Music]

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,800
we're so happy to be here

4
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:20,799
we are talking to you now about giving a

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,439
voice to the industry

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,118
uh this is a very important topic

7
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,920
because the industry

8
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:27,359
uh

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,439
as you guys heard me talk about some of

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,000
you who are here yesterday that the

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,238
industry's changing the world and in

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,480
order for us to do that effectively

13
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,799
we've got to harness this voice and make

14
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,319
it more effective

15
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,959
so

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,079
icbc put together a very impressive

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,160
panel of experts on this topic and i'm

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,239
going to let them introduce themselves

19
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:53,038
because they know who they are and what

20
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:55,280
they do better than i do so let's start

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,239
down there with georg

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,000
georg everyone here as you do this tell

23
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,159
them who you are

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,640
tell them a little bit about

25
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:07,840
being brief your history in the cannabis

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,640
industry and what you're currently doing

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,600
yes hi i'm georg ford and

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,320
i'm

29
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,839
in the lobby field for cannabis since

30
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,959
2002

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,600
as a head of german cannabis association

32
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,399
working for legalization all the time

33
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,359
and

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,040
we made a big step um

35
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:31,599
end of 2019 until then we represented

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,479
both industry and private people at the

37
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,719
same time and then we split that off and

38
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:39,438
built a new association

39
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:42,399
which is the one of mine on the panel

40
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:45,758
here and i'm only

41
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,560
the lobbyist for private people since

42
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,319
that time so i'm a little bit uh

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,159
displaced here as a voice for the

44
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,599
cannabis industry i've been there a long

45
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,359
time i'm not

46
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,519
any more a voice for the cannabis

47
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,359
industry just indirect maybe because the

48
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,640
industry of course

49
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:04,879
profits from my work when i'm successful

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,199
and get the legalization of cannabis in

51
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,199
germany done

52
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,719
i would argue

53
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,559
that being a voice for the people

54
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,239
is a voice for the industry we need the

55
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,159
people to be involved

56
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,599
so i'm i'm happy you're here georg and i

57
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,840
think what you're going to give us is a

58
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,479
lot of valuable insight

59
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,719
now sitting next to york is our

60
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,759
colleague finn go ahead finn take it

61
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,840
away

62
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,159
hi my name is finn i'm the founder and

63
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,640
managing director of the sanity group so

64
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,400
we are a german-based cannabis company

65
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,919
today we're focusing on two different

66
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,599
aspects we're focusing on medicinal

67
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,079
cannabis like everything prescription

68
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,919
related with our environment but also

69
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,440
looking into finnish pharmaceuticals and

70
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,039
medical devices

71
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,039
on the other hand we have our consumer

72
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,519
health unit which is sanity care with

73
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,359
big cbd brands like why in this place

74
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,360
and for us it's super important to bring

75
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,280
the whole topic in germany forward we

76
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,280
co-founded two associations one is the

77
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,560
association pro cbd and the other one is

78
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,640
the bpc

79
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,598
the the german medical cannabis

80
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,839
companies association so being a voice

81
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:10,000
for the cannabis industry in germany or

82
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,759
in whole europe is a very very big topic

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,360
for me and that's something i work for

84
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,840
very hard and so i'm very happy to be

85
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,840

i'm originally dutch but i'm living a

92
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,120
long time in germany already my

93
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,119
background is i'm a biologist i have a

94
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,959
huge passion for hemp as an industrial

95
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,319
raw material

96
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,039
i started in

97
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,919
building materials textiles

98
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,560
food

99
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:47,280
and since 2019 i'm one of the founding

100
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,759
members of the brandon ferban cannabis

101
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,158
virtual of the german trade association

102
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,919
for hemp

103
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,000
it's it's very important for us to be a

104
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,798
voice to get all the people all the

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,598
people involved in the industry together

106
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,840
and to form one voice uh against media

107
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,598
against politicians to make sure that we

108
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,560
achieve all the market requirements all

109
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,679
the

110
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,680
regulatory um

111
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,598
i decided um a place at the table to

112
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,438
make sure that everybody gets what he

113
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,478
wants

114
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:20,478
and to my left is my friend beau whitney

115
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,918
he's kind of a big deal in the united

116
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,918
states

117
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:27,198
so go ahead bo

118
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:29,120
so there's not a whole lot of

119
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,560
of economists that have industry

120
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,840
experience and

121
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,519
so there's a

122
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,239
fair amount of

123
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,560
demand for my services so

124
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,120
in this capacity

125
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,519
michael korea the governmental affairs

126
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,759
person for ncia the national cannabis

127
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,000
industry association was not able to

128
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,120
make it here and so he asked me to stand

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,079
in

130
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,680
i serve as the chief economist for ncia

131
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,560
so i'm here not as mantis in this regard

132
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,918
but

133
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,360
ncia

134
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:03,839
ncia is the largest and oldest and most

135
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,038
diverse trade association in the united

136
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,599
states

137
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,599
and so and they're doing some great work

138
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,680
both at the federal level and at the

139
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,320
state level

140
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,840
i am the ceo of bang inc which is a

141
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,079
publicly traded

142
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,478
cannabis edibles company

143
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,240
and we've been a member of ncia for 10

144
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,399
years

145
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,360
all of our membership dues

146
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,679
in that organization go to lobbying the

147
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,038
federal government for

148
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,240
changes and what i'll give ncia credit

149
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,000
for is

150
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,360
lobbying really hard for the safe

151
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,800
banking act

152
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,840
and for the more act for those of you

153
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,639
who are familiar with it so the ncia is

154
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,959
making big big strides in their lobbying

155
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,800
effort towards legalization

156
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,560
all of this

157
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,879
you know this isn't really a panel on

158
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,720
lobbying so much as it is giving a voice

159
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,159
to the industry

160
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,080
and that can look

161
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,840
a lot of different ways lobbying is one

162
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,918
of those ways

163
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:04,399
but what i would like to do is ask georg

164
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,318
who just recently made a big change when

165
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,239
you split

166
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,680
into two separate entities one giving a

167
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,038
voice to the people and one giving a

168
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,680
voice

169
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:17,680
to the industry specifically

170
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,680
tell us how what you're doing

171
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:23,839
is moving the needle giving p giving

172
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,000
people a voice about legalization tell

173
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,879
us about that split

174
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,680
yeah um it's really interesting to to

175
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,879
see

176
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,600
how different is the work in both fields

177
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,759
we did both together for

178
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,840
many years and that was a

179
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,720
very big range of

180
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,239
things to do and sometimes

181
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,240
not really

182
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,038
fitting good together something like

183
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,000
that like an industry association

184
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:55,439
doesn't organize demonstrations usually

185
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,199
with dreadlock people running around and

186
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:01,199
screaming loud and so on

187
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,840
and as a people's movement we are

188
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,439
working much more public we are really

189
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:09,279
bringing

190
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:11,598
people into the game in the social media

191
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:14,159
issues and uh

192
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,839
making really big protests we reach a

193
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,439
lot of people we can move a lot of

194
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,598
people to make the right click at the

195
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,000
right time and so on

196
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:22,879
as an industry association you work much

197
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,240
more

198
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,360
silent

199
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,400
behind

200
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,280
the doors in the back rooms and so on

201
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:33,519
talking directly to people

202
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,758
and you reach other

203
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:39,198
people other parties especially on the

204
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,919
left side the parties are more

205
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,840
looking what are associations

206
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:47,120
saying coming from a civil liberty

207
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:48,799
standpoint

208
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,959
and on the other side of the

209
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,240
conservative side they are more hearing

210
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:56,959
about what is uh big economy is saying

211
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,560
so that was one of the reasons why i did

212
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,359
this step

213
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,038
to

214
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,720
reach really both together both

215
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,279
associations together

216
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,560
different kinds of politicians and doing

217
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:11,598
that necessary different kinds of work

218
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,399
specialized on both sides to have

219
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:14,800
perfect

220
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:17,198
results on both sides and so it's

221
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,038
important to work together

222
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,879
as an industry association and as a

223
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,680
people's movement

224
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,280
and support each other

225
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,598
a great example of that in the united

226
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,478
states was what just happened in new

227
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,038
york

228
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:34,080
new york just passed recreational

229
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:37,038
cannabis which surprised everybody but

230
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,320
more importantly there were two bills on

231
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,838
the table and one was giving licenses to

232
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,519
the highest bidder

233
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,760
so we knew it was going to be big

234
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,720
business that came in well the new york

235
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:52,159
legacy market has been operating for so

236
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:55,200
many years by uh really people of color

237
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:58,240
in new york so the other bill had

238
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,240
homegrown had um

239
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,519
elements that were more leaning toward

240
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,799
the little guy

241
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,720
and

242
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:08,159
in an example of what george is talking

243
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,120
about there was an effort

244
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:13,919
organized by the happy monkey which is

245
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:18,560
basically a speakeasy and they

246
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:21,120
sent an email out to their 25 000

247
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:23,199
member list which is basically their

248
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,440
list of illicit deliveries that they

249
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,920
make and they said hey we need to go

250
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,040
into storm the government and tell them

251
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:33,039
that we want option b and not option a

252
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,958
and they went and stormed the government

253
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,919
literally they had 10 days before the

254
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:40,799
vote and thousands of people

255
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,079
wrote and called and

256
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,919
protested

257
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,440
and they ended up getting option b so

258
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,919
now they're going to have consumption

259
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,920
lounges and home grow and it is not

260
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,919
going to give licenses to the highest

261
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:54,958
bidder so people

262
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:59,278
like georg who are organizing the

263
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:00,799
citizens are making a difference

264
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:02,399
i'm curious finn you're part of the

265
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:06,240
conservative party

266
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,379
you're a businessman uh not a lobbyist

267
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,600
how do you perceive um

268
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:12,159
[Music]

269
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,120
governments view the cannabis industry

270
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,199
and

271
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,120
uh tell us about how

272
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,160
from your perspective all of this is

273
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,200
happening yeah i mean ironically in this

274
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,439
context

275
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,600
a member of the conservative party for

276
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,920
22 years now

277
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,720
but having said that in 2002 for the

278
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:32,479
first time i was organizing protest

279
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,480
within the party for legalization of

280
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,320
cannabis

281
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,399
back in the days and uh

282
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,640
i tried to answer the question slowly

283
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,000
very precisely but i think it's still

284
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,240
worthwhile to go back in the days in

285
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,480
2002 when i wrote my first applications

286
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,200
of legalizing cannabis the way how the

287
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,800
conservative party perceived me was like

288
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,079
what the hell is going on with this guy

289
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,240
like uh

290
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,078
why is it you're in the wrong room

291
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,240
why is a member of our party suddenly

292
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:59,838
writing applications for for admitting

293
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,839
that and

294
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,279
if i look at it now and

295
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,120
in the last 20 years i had a lot of

296
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,200
positions in the party and i always

297
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,560
tried to be a bit active

298
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,240
i saw that the picture is really

299
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:11,838
changing i mean just yesterday there has

300
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,079
been avin riddle here who is one of the

301
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,160
cdu guys who's in the parliament he's

302
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:18,078
the head of the the health commission in

303
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,480
the german parliament so he's a really

304
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,799
high up conservative cdu guy and he

305
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,800
wants to legalize and i think

306
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,958
a lot has changed over that time so

307
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,719
that's definitely the good news the bad

308
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,319
news is that i still have the feeling

309
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,240
talking to political politicians almost

310
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,519
every day um it's still very mixed so um

311
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,120
politicians

312
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,959
don't have much knowledge about the

313
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,480
cannabis sector people like georg and

314
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,479
also people like you you're working on

315
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,079
it changing it every single day by

316
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,839
talking to them but most of the

317
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,559
politicians i know don't even know the

318
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,800
difference between the thc and cbd for

319
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,399
example so for them it's just the same

320
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:53,838
even hemp seed oil for them is just the

321
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,600
same it's something with cannabis and

322
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,440
that should be illegal so there's a lot

323
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,440
of education that needs to happen

324
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,800
exactly right and beau was letting me

325
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,000
know he wants to comment on what you

326
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,719
just said

327
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,039
yeah in the united states i think a lot

328
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,720
of the politicians still have this

329
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,639
stereotype

330
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,480
associated with cannabis businesses and

331
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,079
cannabis operators

332
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,399
and they think of them more from the

333
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:19,919
traditional market rather than from the

334
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,879
modern day market and so one of the

335
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:26,159
roles that ncia does is we bring this

336
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:28,879
legitimacy and this professionalism um

337
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,639
to the politicians so that they see

338
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,439
the industry in a different light and i

339
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,480
think that's really really important to

340
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,360
transition away from this stereotype and

341
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,920
more into the into the business and and

342
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,839
uh legitimate times i told everyone

343
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,278
yesterday i'm part of the we jokingly

344
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,440
refer to ourselves as the female

345
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:50,639
cannabis mafia and it's a group of women

346
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,200
ceos that uh we are a formal group we

347
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,879
get together we invite politicians to a

348
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,800
monthly dinner

349
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:57,919
with industry leaders

350
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,199
and

351
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:04,078
invariably they say to us oh wow you

352
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,320
have supply chain you have logistics you

353
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,759
have 3pl they don't realize we're really

354
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,120
in industry they think we all have

355
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,600
dreadlocks and

356
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,240
bob marley while we're you know

357
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,800
it it freaks them out but they do

358
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,079
it's a perfect point that we're all here

359
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,479
showing them that we're really in

360
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:22,559
industry marine tell us about your

361
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,159
lobbying efforts

362
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,078
well i think that's a it's a good point

363
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:27,759
i think education is at the basis of

364
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:30,000
everything we do and one of the most

365
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,879
important things that happened to the

366
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,159
split of the dh file and the b

367
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:38,879
vcw the german association for cannabis

368
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:40,799
industry is that we show how diverse the

369
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,720
landscape is of all possible

370
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,198
stakeholders in the industry that's a

371
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,959
very broad topic which goes into very

372
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,198
different types of branches and that it

373
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,719
can be useful for a lot of different

374
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:52,000
industries from

375
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,240
law to

376
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,440
agriculture to textile to high-end

377
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,720
applications machine building food

378
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,480
also

379
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,560
science so i think

380
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,920
it was already there and now finally the

381
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:05,599
time is coming we have seen a lot of

382
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,599
momentum coming up also by companies

383
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,680
like like finns everything that's uh

384
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,199
coming over from from north america that

385
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:12,879
there is a lot of momentum and people

386
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:15,679
have a lot of questions and they need

387
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:17,759
one central point a independent point

388
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:20,479
for getting those answers and i think as

389
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,879
in the trade association we can form

390
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,278
such a point of information for

391
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,120
politicians for media for interested

392
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:30,000
companies to take away

393
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,879
uncertainties risks in order to make

394
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,879
them

395
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,519
easier with the topic of hemp and see

396
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,439
them see what kind of options they have

397
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,078
with this new emerging industry and how

398
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,760
it can help them and their people

399
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,958
electorates companies etc

400
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,519
the thought that went through my head

401
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:49,439
when you were uh giving us your answer

402
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,519
was that um

403
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,920
you play an important role in moving the

404
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,959
industry forward but it's also a big

405
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:59,039
responsibility um just like any

406
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:01,679
quote-unquote representative

407
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:04,399
form of anything if you get your agenda

408
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,000
your personal agenda caught up in things

409
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,679
it can also

410
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,919
be problematic so how do you keep

411
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:14,159
yourself neutral or how do you make sure

412
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:16,240
you're representing the actual industry

413
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,159
well for me personally i always keep the

414
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,000
plant central you know we are working

415
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:23,120
with a natural resource so it's all

416
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,919
about the plant we all have different

417
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,759
reasons why we went into this industry

418
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,319
for me it's the high potential of it

419
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:32,799
it's naturality how it shows us that we

420
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,759
need to return to circular economy we

421
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:38,639
have zero waste options or a very modern

422
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:41,278
day products so it shows that we can

423
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,519
choose different ways but still live in

424
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:45,519
the same way and i think all companies

425
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,639
all people i i met

426
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:51,600
share that same kind of ideology and i

427
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,680
think that's also what what i like to

428
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,480
transmit to politicians into media that

429
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:58,638
it's much more than just a drug or a

430
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,440
medicine or something it's it's a it's a

431
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,519
solution for a lot of things well and i

432
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,560
think it's it's it's our job at the

433
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,610
moment to to show that yeah well-being

434
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,879
over money that was my point yesterday

435
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,839
[Laughter]

436
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:12,799
anyway

437
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,440
bo

438
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,198
tell us how an economist

439
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,720
you're a number cruncher essentially

440
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:23,439
right um how does number crunching

441
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,040
function in a lobbying situation how are

442
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,320
you using your skill set in your

443
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:30,799
education to impact the industry

444
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,720
well a lot of the policies

445
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:34,479
you know as the

446
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,320
industry transitioned a lot of the

447
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,480
policies were based upon what was going

448
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,720
on in the headlines there was a new york

449
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,199
times reporter that had a bunch of

450
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,199
edibles in colorado and freaked out and

451
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:48,240
then all of a sudden there's these

452
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:50,639
endowed yeah and there's all this policy

453
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,639
change that says oh my god edibles are

454
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,000
horrible and we should not have those in

455
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,799
here and

456
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,799
so or there was a headline in the in the

457
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,120
newspaper that talked about energy

458
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:04,558
consumption and the environmental impact

459
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,000
and and so they had all of these policy

460
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:07,199
changes that

461
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,199
were really

462
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,199
harmful to the industry

463
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,439
because there it was headline driven and

464
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,839
not data driven and so

465
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,759
my role is to really provide some

466
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,240
numbers and some

467
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:23,279
context of what the impact of the

468
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,439
policies are on the industry or to

469
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:28,399
really size the industry in such a way

470
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,038
that it's understandable

471
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,000
for the policy makers and takes a lot of

472
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:36,400
the emotion out of the policy making

473
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,440
that's huge that's huge

474
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,440
um does anybody before we move on to our

475
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,960
next question that we all agreed that we

476
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,640
were going to answer

477
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,519
do you any of you want to comment on

478
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,960
what's been said so far

479
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,798
yeah i mean i think one thing that's

480
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,319
probably very important

481
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,720
and i think there were sessions about it

482
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,960
before but i mean bringing cannabis also

483
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,400
to the table is probably especially in

484
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,319
germany very much depending on the next

485
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,400
election and i mean in four weeks or

486
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,839
four and a half weeks we are there and

487
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,240
at the moment i really have the feeling

488
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,240
that there's a change of mindset all

489
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,919
over germany and i think that helps us a

490
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,079
lot and the funny thing is when i'm

491
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,759
saying that i don't only mean that

492
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:15,839
left-wing parties are currently on the

493
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,279
rise it's also even within the

494
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,359
conservative parties we see these

495
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:22,079
changes and i think this next election

496
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:24,159
can really be a pilot for whole europe

497
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,199
if germany decides to open up for model

498
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,320
regions

499
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,480
there will be a lot of european

500
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,000
countries following because many of them

501
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,440
always wait of what germany is doing as

502
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,440
the center of the of the european

503
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,200
economy so i think at the moment the

504
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,400
time for being having a seat on the

505
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,798
table cannot be better than right now

506
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,240
i couldn't agree more i think part of

507
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:44,798
what i was talking about yesterday is i

508
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,359
feel like germany is really positioned

509
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:48,798
well to lead europe and the world but

510
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,479
you have to start looking at yourselves

511
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:52,400
that way

512
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,480
buying american media making sure we

513
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,640
know who you are because you know who we

514
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,400
are um

515
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,160
i i really think it would be a good

516
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,679
thing for the germans to step up and

517
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,960
lead the world i think your market's

518
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,720
huge

519
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,519
and there's more people using cannabis

520
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,558
in germany than than admitting it

521
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:12,240
so imagine if we got everybody to tell

522
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:13,519
the truth and the economist could tell

523
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,798
us that we're

524
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,400
that we're right and that all these

525
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:19,279
people are using cannabis we could we

526
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,280
could be powerful

527
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,280
georg

528
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,919
if you had a magic wand and you could

529
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:28,240
change something in the industry uh or

530
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:32,000
in lobbying or in the rules that would

531
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:35,200
move us forward what would it be

532
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,400
well um my wish would be that

533
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,759
at once in a big bang everybody would

534
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,120
get involved

535
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:46,400
who wants really the cannabis policy to

536
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:49,918
get forward to get to legalization

537
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,679
i've seen here at the acbc in berlin

538
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,880
a couple of years long

539
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,200
a lot of companies

540
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,480
sitting around doing nothing don't

541
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,640
support any legalized lobbyism just

542
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,000
concentrate on their own little business

543
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,360
and little thing

544
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,400
and this is the same for the private

545
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:08,479
people

546
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,559
if millions of cannabis consumers in

547
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,640
germany would at once

548
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:15,839
go on the streets make huge

549
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,559
demonstrations or support their

550
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,558
association

551
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,960
click at the right moment

552
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,919
at the road right side and so on it all

553
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,880
would get involved in one big bang at

554
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,280
the same time companies and people we

555
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,080
would have legalization in the next week

556
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:33,200
done

557
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:35,439
so

558
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,159
look at yourself

559
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,038
think about maybe putting ten percent of

560
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,880
your

561
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:46,460
budget for uh advertisement into your

562
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:50,559
favorite lobby organization

563
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:51,519
[Applause]

564
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:52,558
that

565
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,000
i love

566
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:56,639
action

567
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,960
items and what he just basically gave us

568
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,600
was the solution which is

569
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,319
uh i think everyone went 10

570
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:07,759
but whatever that number is gives

571
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:09,918
something to a lobbying organization uh

572
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,079
my daughter who used to be here in the

573
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,840
oh there she is or no that's not her

574
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,519
anyway she

575
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,639
was

576
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:20,319
working as an intern for a group that

577
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,840
used to register voters that's what she

578
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:23,038
did one summer she broke all kinds of

579
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,038
records

580
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,519
it was not partisan she wasn't trying to

581
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,720
register democrats or republicans just

582
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,599
voters

583
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,279
and

584
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:32,959
but they did have a little

585
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:34,639
you know bend on it and it was if you

586
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,880
could be 17

587
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,400
you can vote at 18 so if there was a

588
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,760
there was a birth date cut off and if

589
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,600
you were 17 after a certain date that

590
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,919
meant that you were going to be 18 at

591
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:48,959
the time of the election well they know

592
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,640
that young voters vote for cannabis and

593
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,400
they know that young voters vote for the

594
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,480
environment so the things that they

595
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,120
wanted to pass they knew if they could

596
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,200
get more young voters to vote they could

597
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,319
get their you know they were reverse

598
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,880
engineering

599
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,798
the system what he's basically saying is

600
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,240
let's reverse engineer the system let's

601
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:11,038
figure out how do you all give

602
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,679
five euros let's say per month and what

603
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:17,279
i learned from this was it was better to

604
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,679
give 5 euros per month 60 euros than it

605
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:22,240
was to give 60 euros because those

606
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,320
organizations need to budget and they

607
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,558
can't budget if all of a sudden you give

608
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:29,279
them 200 euros or 100

609
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:30,319
000 euros they need to have that monthly

610
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,399
budget

611
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,480
so everybody in here if you did a

612
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,480
monthly budget and and gave some money

613
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,200
to your lobbying organization

614
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,919
uh the people and the government we

615
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,840
could move mountains as an industry so

616
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,360
thank you for that comment what would

617
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:46,720
your comment be

618
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,719
um finn

619
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,480
you if you had a magic wand so if i

620
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,480
would have a magic wand i think the

621
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,240
first thing i would do is to take

622
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,279
cannabis out of the german narcotics

623
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,880
drug law

624
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,960
or the btmg

625
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,320
as many germans of you know

626
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,240
the reason for that is because i think

627
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:03,599
that's the problem of so many things if

628
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,919
you only look from the medical

629
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:08,319
perspective prescription via digital

630
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,799
health like e-receipt like everything

631
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:12,480
that's electronic um is not possible

632
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:15,440
because it's part of the narcotics drug

633
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,200
conv or narcotics drug law um similar to

634
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,640
if you think about model regions or

635
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,840
legalization always the btmg is the big

636
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,159
bottleneck

637
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:26,480
also for we talked about it earlier thc

638
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:29,280
and food the the limits you can have

639
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,440
it's all actually focused on the german

640
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,839
narcotics drug law and i think taking

641
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,919
out cannabis out of that would open up a

642
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:37,519
whole lot of opportunities to actually

643
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,440
really change something for cannabis in

644
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:41,278
germany and then hopefully successively

645
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,519
in europe

646
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:46,159
magic wand what would you change

647
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:48,339
well i would definitely say um that's

648
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,440
that's a major

649
00:23:48,339 --> 00:23:51,678
[Music]

650
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,200
change that we all need in addition what

651
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,360
finn already mentioned is i think we

652
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,120
need to um

653
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:59,278
get a higher thc

654
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,599
level for foods because the limits they

655
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:04,720
have proposed now are so low that we

656
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,599
actually cannot sell hemp oil anymore

657
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,600
and

658
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,278
the scientific bases worldwide are much

659
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:11,199
more advanced we know that the levels

660
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:13,599
can be much much higher

661
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,319
and those levels are actually at the

662
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:19,439
basis for having a healthy agricultural

663
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:21,038
production of hemp in germany and that's

664
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,720
the basis for everything so if we want

665
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:25,679
to do something with hemp we need to be

666
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,759
able to grow it but if the the the

667
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,600
requirements uh for

668
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:31,200
the products are still so low that you

669
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:32,959
you cannot sell it afterwards then

670
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,919
nobody has the incentive to grow so i

671
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,640
think we should work there primarily and

672
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:42,080
uh just adhere to what other countries

673
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,960
in the world already found out and um

674
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:44,798
and

675
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,558
i think that's that's for us the main

676
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:49,278
focus now and then from there the

677
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,960
education will take its own loop and as

678
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:51,839
soon as farmers start the rest will

679
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,840
follow

680
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:56,079
i have so much i want to say about that

681
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,599
as an edibles company but this isn't

682
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:59,199
about me

683
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:01,199
what would you

684
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,360
change if you had a magic wand

685
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,000
um if we had a magic wand i think we

686
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:08,558
would really focus on clearing up a lot

687
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,240
of the regulatory uncertainty there's so

688
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:14,000
much murkiness in regulatory policies

689
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,919
that it's inhibiting the growth of the

690
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,839
industry for example

691
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,159
even though hemp is legal in the united

692
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:22,240
states there's so much uncertainty

693
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,480
because they're the the regulators are

694
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,120
treating it as though it's an illegal

695
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,679
product still

696
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,678
that investment is not flowing in as

697
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,480
much into the industry and the like and

698
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,559
so the infrastructural development is

699
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,519
being inhibited the same thing applies

700
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:41,519
on the on the higher thc side where

701
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:44,079
there's regulatory uncertainty there's

702
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:46,079
lack of banking there's there's high

703
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:48,079
taxes to the point where they're taxing

704
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:50,399
people out of the industry

705
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:52,480
so clearing up that regulatory

706
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,038
uncertainty and the murkiness would be

707
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,880
very very high on the list am i right

708
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:58,640
yeah i can i can only adhere to that i

709
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,559
think that's also in europe it's it's

710
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,038
highly essential we see we have problems

711
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,639
with uh paying service banking

712
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:06,720
insurance so there's a lot of

713
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,799
bureaucracy that needs to be getting out

714
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,798
of the way in order to make it much more

715
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:13,679
easy for people to start working in the

716
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:16,720
industry to have less hurdles uh to have

717
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,720
more certainty uh that goes from the

718
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,798
investment to the farmers to the to the

719
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,000
processors and to the retailers so how

720
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:24,639
do we do that

721
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,038
how do we get it less murky

722
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,759
we should all get together combined and

723
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:32,879
be loud we go back to that giving five

724
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:35,200
euros a month thing for the lobbyists

725
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,400
comes back full circle finn what would

726
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,240
you like to add

727
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,919
yeah i mean the thing is i'm sometimes

728
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,480
wondering what is the better solution

729
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,159
like going out and be loud or actually

730
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,000
what you also described being rather

731
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,919
with the politicians in the back because

732
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,200
what i'm sometimes wondering is about

733
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,840
even though you're allowed you're

734
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,440
outside there's a big hunfpag in germany

735
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:54,798
i think many politicians don't listen to

736
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,679
that and at the end they are the ones

737
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:59,519
making policy so i think for example

738
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,519
what some companies and some

739
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,679
associations start doing and i think

740
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,519
the the hanford band did also very well

741
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,360
to do tax systems so he like how would a

742
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:08,639
tax look like and i think that's

743
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,719
something that's super interesting

744
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,919
because if you can convince politicians

745
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,919
that they can earn money with the

746
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,600
legalization especially after corona

747
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,840
where a lot of government subsidies went

748
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,599
into the corona support

749
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:22,079
every politician right now is looking

750
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:23,759
for money so just to

751
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,599
poke them a little bit and say like look

752
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,278
there's a new complete honey pot of

753
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:29,918
money that you can access just by doing

754
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:32,480
that is something that i think also yes

755
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,799
get involved and spend more and be loud

756
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,480
but i think being also in the back doors

757
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:38,079
and talking directly to authorities or

758
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,079
politicians is also a very very

759
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,240
important factor

760
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:45,199
bo

761
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,679
so policies right now

762
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,240
both in europe and in the us seem to be

763
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,679
really controlling they want to control

764
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,519
what's going on

765
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,159
rather than support the growth and

766
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:59,519
development of a nascent industry and so

767
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:02,880
that controlling is is really something

768
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:04,798
that if policy were to change and it was

769
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,600
supportive then there would be greater

770
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:09,200
employment greater economic development

771
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,199
greater

772
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,960
offerings on the medical side on the

773
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,440
industrial side

774
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,240
on the wellness side and so

775
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,798
i think politicians and and and policy

776
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,120
makers really need to change the way

777
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,639
that they view the industry

778
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,239
and promote further growth and

779
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,600
development

780
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,798
we saw that in america where

781
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:34,719
how many of you familiar with the

782
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:37,599
oklahoma market in the u.s

783
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,600
two guys okay

784
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:42,480
i flew into oklahoma city

785
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,398
i got off the airplane jumped in a cab

786
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,038
and was literally assaulted by

787
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:50,000
billboards cannabis here cannabis here

788
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:52,398
cannabis arrows go turn the corner go

789
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,240
left two more cannabis dispensaries

790
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:56,319
literally there are more cannabis

791
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,880
dispensaries in oklahoma than coffee

792
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:00,879
shops than starbucks

793
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,559
it was i can't remember that i'm sure

794
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,640
nick knows but i think it was five

795
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:06,879
dollars to get your license

796
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,480
uh and everybody got a license in

797
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,320
oklahoma well to me that's the free

798
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,798
market because when which is a

799
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:16,319
conservative value when you let the free

800
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:18,319
market speak the people that make it win

801
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:20,879
and the people who run shitty businesses

802
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:23,359
lose and then you just basically you

803
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,120
bring all the tax money in that comes

804
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:27,519
from selling a ton of product and you

805
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:29,759
figure out who who's running a good

806
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:31,918
business that is free market economy so

807
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:34,879
you lower the barrier to entry and

808
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,799
oklahoma has a really nice market

809
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,159
it's working and people are getting

810
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:40,558
cannabis

811
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,000
and that's the way it should be georg

812
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:45,918
what would you like to add to the

813
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,919
conversation around opening this all up

814
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,840
well um

815
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,919
i would like to add when i'm talking to

816
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:55,278
you it's not about five euros a month

817
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,720
and not about 60 a year which is exactly

818
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:59,038
our usual

819
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,679
tariff for private members

820
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:02,640
but here i'm talking to companies right

821
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,399
and

822
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,278
that's a joke for you

823
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:10,079
i really meant what i said 10 of your

824
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:12,480
advertisement budget look at the numbers

825
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:15,199
how much is that there are little chops

826
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,159
maybe you can just uh

827
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,319
spend 1000 euros for it well then spend

828
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,240
100 euros and if you are a bigger

829
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:25,119
company and you have the ability to

830
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:28,640
spend 100 000 euros for advertisement

831
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:29,918
think about giving 10 000 to your lobby

832
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,640
organization

833
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,640
so then we will move the mountains right

834
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:38,639
the point i was trying to make is that

835
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,640
they should budget it on a monthly basis

836
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,320
so you can budget it on a monthly basis

837
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,919
and not just write you one check you'll

838
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:46,398
take the money any way you can get it i

839
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,000
get that i'm just giving them that piece

840
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:51,599
of information that i learned from the

841
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,960
process so right now we have about 15

842
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:55,599
minutes left

843
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,079
um i wanted to open up questions to the

854
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,320
the marketing and branding agency focus

855
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,880
on the global cannabis industry

856
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:31,119

i'm sorry it's called what highly

859
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:37,518
capitalized network so if anyone would

860
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:39,759
like to be interviewed and get exposure

861
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,120
to key stakeholders in the us please

862
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,599
come speak to me

863
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:46,158
so i'm new to the industry um at least

864
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:48,398
professionally and

865
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,159
you know i've got a few observations

866
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:51,199
being completely new and it's my first

867
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,360
conference

868
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,440
so the first observation is you know

869
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:57,359
it's we've got this real gold rush kind

870
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,720
of culture

871
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,199
and uh

872
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,919
you know secondly i haven't heard a lot

873
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,759
about consumers at all in the conference

874
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,080
so far you know the consumer needs

875
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:09,278
states you know the patients

876
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:11,839
after all they're the ones who are

877
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:13,839
making everyone rich so be interesting

878
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:16,158
maybe to have more discussion around

879
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:18,480
consumers but the third observation is

880
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,360
that in i've heard a lot of people talk

881
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,240
about ethical values

882
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:25,038
and

883
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,839
wanting a different type of industry and

884
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:27,759
not

885
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:30,319
copying what the other industries have

886
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:31,200
done and trying to reverse engineer

887
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:33,599
um

888
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,519
my question to the panel is

889
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:38,079
you know have you thought about a kind

890
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,919
of a charter you know maybe also one

891
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:42,639
voice for the industry instead of lots

892
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,640
of different cannabis associations one

893
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,159
voice with a kind of ethical charter

894
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,960
where we say

895
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,399
um

896
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,640
you know we would like a different sort

897
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:53,518
of industry with certain

898
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:57,038
you know fair trade sustainability you

899
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,880
know equal opportunities etc etc

900
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:02,000
all the things which

901
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,080
probably our consumers in our industry

902
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,240
would very much like and would help

903
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:08,879
differentiate

904
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,399
can someone close that door please that

905
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,799
low level noise is

906
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:14,000
probably not great for the recording go

907
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:16,398
ahead finn

908
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,359
yeah i mean a lot of different questions

909
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:20,959
i think i i tried to answer two of them

910
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:22,719
one is i fully agree with you we have

911
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,640
too many associations and i think we

912
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,399
should combine those and really be the

913
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,600
one voice instead of having too many

914
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:29,359
different ones

915
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:31,038
i think it's a big problem and george

916
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:32,079
said in the beginning that there are

917
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:33,679
also

918
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:36,000
cannabis companies who are against

919
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,360
legalization so that actually confuses

920
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,398
the whole perception of cannabis

921
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:39,678
companies

922
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:41,518
in the public and also towards

923
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,440
politicians however you cannot change

924
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,278
their opinion but at least the ones who

925
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,120
have the same opinion they should be

926
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:48,880
together and fight for it

927
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:50,398
the second thing that i actually agree

928
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,600
with you completely is the what you call

929
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:53,918
the charter

930
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:55,839
so with our association pro cbd i mean

931
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,000
cbd is a fraction of the whole cannabis

932
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:00,319
market but what for example we did we

933
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,398
did like a kind of charter where we said

934
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:04,558
this is the rules we want to play by so

935
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,558
what kind of analytics do we use when we

936
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:08,398
say this is the percentage of cbd you

937
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:10,639
find in the product because you wouldn't

938
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:12,559
believe how much variation there is in

939
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,159
oils that say 10 percent and then

940
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:16,398
suddenly you find an oil that is in in

941
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,280
the reality 12 and someone doesn't even

942
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:21,199
have cbd in there so that is one thing

943
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,800
then the second thing how you advertise

944
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:24,480
and what kind of promises you make to

945
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,800
the customers is something where we also

946
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,159
have a self-regulatory charter where we

947
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,800
say

948
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,079
if there's no proof in science for it

949
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,159
don't even mention it in your

950
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,320
advertising and i mean that's just two

951
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,480
things the whole charter is i think 15

952
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,079
points but i think that is something if

953
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,000
we want to be taking serious as a

954
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,760
cannabis industry and also not only be

955
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,800
taken serious by our customers and

956
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,879
patients but also by the authorities we

957
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,800
have to grow up as an industry and

958
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:53,759
growing up as an industry means that we

959
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,839
also have to have self-cleaning elements

960
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,839
in terms of like differentiating the

961
00:34:55,838 --> 00:35:00,320
good and serious companies in the market

962
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:02,239
from and let's be honest there are some

963
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,039
black sheeps in the market because those

964
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:06,959
black sheeps very often determine on how

965
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:08,719
patients and customers and authorities

966
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,800
look at the industry and i think this

967
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:12,799
charter saying this is the rules we play

968
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,240
by is something very important so i

969
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,119
fully heartedly agree with what you just

970
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:18,879
said both marine and beau want to

971
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,160
comment on that so we're going to start

972
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,680
with mccain

973
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,399
yeah i'll keep it short i think another

974
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:24,639
a

975
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,440
very important point you mentioned is

976
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:32,400
consumer safety i think that's the final

977
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:34,000
point where all of our efforts result so

978
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,280
in the end it should be safe for

979
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,239
everybody

980
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,079
for industry players for consumers and i

981
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:42,399
think that should be the basis for all

982
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,680
kind of regulations and policies that

983
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,240
that are made

984
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:48,639
but we believe that those uh rules

985
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:51,919
should be by scientific standards where

986
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:54,719
we all get together and and and uh let

987
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,680
dogmas and old paradigms out uh because

988
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,078
in the end

989
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:00,319
as long as you let experts set those

990
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,800
levels because what we see happening

991
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,880
right is that uh you have politicians

992
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,519
setting levels and they don't know what

993
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,519
they're doing so they'll set levels like

994
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:12,400
you said in the hemp seeds so you have

995
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:13,838
to allow the industry to have a voice to

996
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,440
set the levels

997
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:18,320
to determine what's safe but what were

998
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:21,039
you going to say so in the early days of

999
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:23,599
of the cannabis movement

1000
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:25,519
say 2014 you know in the in the

1001
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,559
legalization there was a lot of

1002
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:29,599
competing policies a lot of competing

1003
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:32,639
interests

1004
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,320
and so when politicians would get all of

1005
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,879
these different perspectives they

1006
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,519
wouldn't know who to believe or what was

1007
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,200
important and like and so there's just

1008
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:43,358
as though there's a consolidation in

1009
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:45,519
some states of businesses there's been a

1010
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:49,279
consolidation in advocacy groups in the

1011
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:50,960
united states and um now although there

1012
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,240
are differences from one group to the

1013
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,838
next

1014
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:58,319
they're starting to um align on key

1015
00:36:55,838 --> 00:37:01,119
issues such as banking such as taxation

1016
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,160
such as social justice and the like um

1017
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,559
so that

1018
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:06,639
they uh represent the industry in a

1019
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:10,000
unified voice and and i have a second

1020
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:12,799
comment is uh you mentioned the the gold

1021
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
rush or the green rush that's been a

1022
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,960
significant obstacle for the industry to

1023
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,519
overcome because policymakers seem to

1024
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,880
think that with this gold rush comes all

1025
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:26,880
of this money

1026
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:29,920
and so part of the education that we do

1027
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,240
is educating that very few people in the

1028
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:36,000
industry are actually making profits and

1029
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:39,358
making money and and that education and

1030
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,119
that aha moment for the politicians

1031
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:44,960
will help them

1032
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:47,280
temper their enthusiasm about taxation

1033
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,159
and and implementing these rules that

1034
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,839
are rather draconian or overbearing when

1035
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:55,358
it comes to compliance and all these

1036
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:57,519
other costs so that the gold rush is has

1037
00:37:55,358 --> 00:38:00,000
really been one of those things that

1038
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:01,599
has been difficult for us to overcome

1039
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,159
a lot of the people that are here didn't

1040
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,800
see the very first presentation of the

1041
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:09,039
global investment forum and it was

1042
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,119
eye-opening when you see

1043
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:12,719
the billions of dollars that are being

1044
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,119
hemorrhaged these companies are losing

1045
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,719
money what it why are they there they're

1046
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,720
investing forward because we know

1047
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:22,078
eventually we'll have an industry and

1048
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:22,078
we'll make money um

1049
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,358
all right one question my name is

1050
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,040
michael merkley and i'm have an

1051
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:31,039
agricultural

1052
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,199
scientific background and i'm working at

1053
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:36,079
the moment with industrial hemp and i

1054
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:37,919
see directly at the universities

1055
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,839
how hard is it to work with industrial

1056
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,400
hemp it's like i need license from the

1057
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:44,799
bay farm to work with with industrial

1058
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,119
hemp in greenhouses and i talked to a

1059
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,440
lot of um other colleagues and they want

1060
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:52,240
to work with cannabis but there's also

1061
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,639
money but the bureaucracy is so hard and

1062
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:56,639
i think that's a big problem i'm asking

1063
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:58,559
them how do you see it in the next years

1064
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:01,118
if we have some improvements then from a

1065
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:02,960
scientific you you have the possibility

1066
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,920
to make research in it which is the

1067
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,838
basic for the politicians and all that

1068
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,760
that we can improve all the the

1069
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:11,199
situation

1070
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,599
was that a question

1071
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:15,759
yeah his question is how do we get these

1072
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:19,119
politicians to stop treating cannabis

1073
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,040
like yellow cake uranium

1074
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,400
and how to treat it like a plant because

1075
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:25,440
you have to jump through so many hoops

1076
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,720
just to work with it i think yeah go go

1077
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,400
ahead mike

1078
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:30,480
well i think um thank you for your

1079
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,480
question i i cannot agree more with you

1080
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,320
it's one of the big hurdles it's what

1081
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,240
finn said we need to get it out of the

1082
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,119
narcotics law at the beginning because

1083
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:41,598
that's the biggest stone on on the road

1084
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:44,000
there uh and i think it's it's our job

1085
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:48,160
uh to show politicians or policymakers

1086
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,559
that in science in research lies

1087
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:53,039
the potential of this plant we know a

1088
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:55,279
lot already but we don't know enough and

1089
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,440
especially not how we can introduce it

1090
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,680
or implement it in already existing

1091
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,440
industries or how we can change them for

1092
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,440
the better using this plant and i think

1093
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,280
a lot of people are waiting for these

1094
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,838
moments to happen to open up the

1095
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,319
floodgates of more research money of

1096
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:12,719
easing up bureaucracy so that's one of

1097
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:15,358
the main points also for our association

1098
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:16,719
to uh to battle yes finn

1099
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:17,838
yes uh in the beginning i mentioned to

1100
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:19,759
you that i'm a member of the

1101
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:21,920
conservative party so very often i

1102
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,560
consider myself a kind of trojan horse

1103
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:27,119
so because they probably

1104
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:29,599
still uh think about me as a

1105
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,358
not so cannabis person in the like in

1106
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,960
the comparison and just to give you an

1107
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:34,078
example so the left-wing party in

1108
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,920
germany the

1109
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,400
linker they brought

1110
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,639
like a paper to the parliament that they

1111
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,720
want to actually

1112
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:44,879
redo the whole legislation around

1113
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:49,039
industrial hemp so the limit should go

1114
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:51,119
from 0.2 to 0.3 um cbd should be always

1115
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:53,119
legal when it's from industrial hemp and

1116
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,200
so on and so far

1117
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,800
and then the cdu was calling me and said

1118
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:59,279
do you want to be a speaker in the

1119
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,960
parliament hearing about this

1120
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,359
and obviously the cdu wanted me to take

1121
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,280
a more conservative stand on cannabis

1122
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:06,799
and instead of doing it myself which i

1123
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,040
could have done

1124
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,440
i was actually introducing three

1125
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:13,599
conservative farmers who have been cdu

1126
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,280
members for the last 50 years to them

1127
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:18,240
who are growing hemp

1128
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,400
and these three farmers were actually

1129
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:22,399
going crazy to the parliamentarian

1130
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,400
selling the way how you treat us we want

1131
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,920
to grow hemp we need to grow hemp you

1132
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,680
really with the bureaucracy and with the

1133
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,760
administration you're really killing our

1134
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:31,838
business in the cdu the party was

1135
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,000
shocked about how their own voters who

1136
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:35,440
are conservative farmers were against

1137
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,400
their stand on

1138
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,358
on

1139
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,760
on on industrial hemp and i loved it and

1140
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:43,759
i think it shows that it's not this

1141
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,000
classical left-wing right-wing question

1142
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,839
anymore it's actually for for for many

1143
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,159
farmers it's a question of of the future

1144
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:52,159
of the business and i think

1145
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:53,759
by actually breaking off these typical

1146
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:55,759
or these are against cannabis and these

1147
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,760
are for cannabis but really bringing

1148
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,359
more of those trojan horses in who are

1149
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,280
actually fighting for it i think that's

1150
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:02,719
actually a really good thing to do and

1151
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,240
the industrial hemp farmers i think

1152
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:06,719
there are so many conservatives among

1153
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:08,159
them to actually activate them and send

1154
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,318
them to the party and to the local

1155
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,920
parliamentarians and let them tell them

1156
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:13,759
how important industrial hemp for them

1157
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,280
is as farmers i think that is also

1158
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,359
something that will change

1159
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,119
how politicians perceive industrial hemp

1160
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:21,598
can everybody please give fin a hand for

1161
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,599
doing that

1162
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,400
that's magic that's magic right there

1163
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,519
that was awesome uh hi we got another

1164
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,519
one here we got another one over here

1165
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:35,838
he's been waiting for a while too yes

1166
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:37,838
yeah yes quick question so um

1167
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:40,159
in my opinion one of the uh big

1168
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:42,719
differences between the us and germany

1169
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:44,559
is that in the us you have celebrities

1170
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:47,439
that are being a voice for the cannabis

1171
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:49,838
industry martha stewart snoop doggy dog

1172

just named they're everywhere there

1174
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:56,318
do you think that's not a question to

1175
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,079
the german associations and also to

1176
00:42:56,318 --> 00:43:00,159
companies do you think that this would

1177
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,359
be possible in germany or do you want

1178
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:04,000
them

1179
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:05,519
even to be a voice go for it i could

1180
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,440
react straight away because if you

1181
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:09,358
follow sanity group a bit in the press

1182
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,358
we have celebrity investors so for

1183
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:14,000
example william is invested in us but

1184
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:15,519
also mario goetze the soccer star um and

1185
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,679
andre schirler who has also been part of

1186
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:19,039
the national german soccer team

1187
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,440
but the thing is you know i have this

1188
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:22,318
discussion with them quite frequently

1189
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,400
and

1190
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:26,480
they are not as open as their american

1191
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,559
counterparts to that so for example when

1192
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,240
mario goetz invested he was really

1193
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:32,559
interested in the in the medical side of

1194
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:34,000
the business and then the build

1195
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:35,279
newspaper like the biggest german

1196
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,760
boulevard newspaper make the big

1197
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,560
headline is mario godzilla high question

1198
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,319
mark he's now investing in cannabis and

1199
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,078
then he called me and he was really

1200
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:45,759
shaken saying oh my god the the

1201
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,440
anti-doping agency will be in front of

1202
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,599
my door just by tomorrow because now

1203
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,079
they are thinking i consume cannabis

1204
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,559
and i have the feeling that celebrities

1205
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,079
in germany also in europe in general are

1206
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:57,599
still very

1207
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,800
conservative compared to the u.s

1208
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,559
counterparts

1209
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,119
would it help if they take a public

1210
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:05,358
stand absolutely because people are

1211
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,358
listening to what these guys saying so

1212
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:09,279
what for example the whole influencers

1213
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:10,880
on instagram and everyone people are

1214
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,800
really following and if mario godzilla

1215
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,358
would stand there in the public and say

1216
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,800
i like cannabis and i use it i believe

1217
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:18,480
so many people who are as followers

1218
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,480
would think like oh wow it can't be that

1219
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,079
bad if that serious guy is doing that

1220
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,358
and i mean we are trying that this is

1221
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,119
one of the reasons why we took those

1222
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:26,639
celebrity investors on board but i can

1223
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,760
tell you it's it's really hard to

1224
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:31,279
convince them to publicly be be um

1225
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,040
advocate of cannabis and i think

1226
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,359
unfortunately as a society we are not

1227
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:37,440
there yet once you have this brick in

1228
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:38,880
the wall i think it will fall down but

1229
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,639
you need the first five to ten

1230
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,800
celebrities who are well known who are

1231
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:45,039
really also not the usual suspect who go

1232
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,280
to the front and say like yes uh i'm for

1233
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:49,440
cannabis does anybody here know tony

1234
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,319
close can we get him

1235
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,639
in our can you get him to join i mean i

1236
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:57,519
think if he came forward it's a wrap

1237
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:59,358
we've got the whole world then right

1238
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,199
we've only got a minute left um are you

1239
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:04,239
the next question go for it

1240
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:05,719
he'll be here for the next icbc really

1241
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:08,078
just kidding but let's try it out

1242
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:10,399
[Laughter]

1243
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,240
and so hello everyone my name is luke

i'm a filmmaker i got introduced to

1245
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:16,159
cannabis by seeing the

1246
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:19,519
the the human rights potential

1247
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:23,440
witnessing villages in nepal quickly

1248
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:24,880
and a medical patient using rso for

1249
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,039

1250
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,640
escaping his deathbed so this was my

1251
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:30,880
introduction and ever since i've been

1252
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:34,639
filming voices from

1253
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:37,280
very like the cannabis industry so

1254
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:39,838
short comment there's so much potential

1255
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,119
question yes the question is is needed

1256
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:42,880
yes

1257
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:46,280
so the question is

1258
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,280
after the comment

1259
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:52,159
how do we how do we

1260
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:53,440
gather all the knowledge here only from

1261
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:56,239
this room

1262
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:59,760

1263
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:01,199
wisdom the experience the medical data

1264
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,319
and we have a lot of data we learned

1265
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:06,799
this today in order to spread what this

1266
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:08,159
conference hall is already knowing on

1267
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,160
cannabis

1268
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:13,358
to our fellow humans because when we

1269
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:15,679
step outside from this hotel we having a

1270
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:18,159
pandemic we have a health crisis we have

1271
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:21,039
economic crisis and everyone here in

1272
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:23,118

1273
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:26,159
beautiful plant provides more than 30

1274
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:29,920
000 products so this is you have here

1275
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:31,519
georg georg told us we give 10

1276
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,119
of our economic

1277
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:35,759
money to

1278
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:38,960
lobby but the other the other fact of

1279
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:41,280
the matter is icbc's doing that

1280
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,838
the fact that icbc brought all of us

1281
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,440
here and we're all getting on the same

1282
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:47,440
page it's like when the parents go

1283
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,760
behind the door and they get on the same

1284
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,039
page before they scold the child that's

1285
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,800
what we're doing we're getting on the

1286
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:54,400
same page and we're going to go

1287
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,240
talk to our politicians and we're going

1288
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,318
to talk to each other and we're going to

1289
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:59,679
stop pretending that we don't use

1290
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:01,440
cannabis you're going to come out of the

1291
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:02,399
closet and you're going to speak the

1292
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,480
truth and we're going to fight the

1293
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,480
stigma

1294
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,199
that's the thing

1295
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,199
we're fighting

1296
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,480
we're fighting against almost 100 years

1297
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:16,078
of anti-cannabis propaganda and right

1298
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,280

1299
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,519
have to be done right and we are

1300
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,680
