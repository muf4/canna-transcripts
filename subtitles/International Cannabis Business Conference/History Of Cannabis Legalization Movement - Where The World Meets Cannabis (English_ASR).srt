1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
in the mid 80s AIDS epidemic was in full

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:07,199
flight in San Francisco people realized

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,638
that cannabis had a lot of medical

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,000
properties and it was helping people

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:13,838
live longer Better Lives look like a

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,599
hippie but I wasn't right you have to go

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,719
and you buy your cannabis and then you

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,160
go back home and you smoke your cannabis

9
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:22,118

right why don't you tell us a little bit

89
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,759
Uno because really that was the

90
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:27,959
epicenter of what every where everything

91
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,878
is at right right now it was really the

92
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,479
heart of the Cannabis activism movement

93
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:33,199
the Bay Area was for for a long time

94
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,919
could you uh could you speak to that a

95
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,639
little

96
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:39,158
bit uh yeah man I grew you know I grew

97
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:42,759
up in San Francisco born and raised uh

98
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:45,840
and right around um in the mid 80s when

99
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:47,519
when the HIV AIDS epidemic was at full

100
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,360
flight in San Francisco people realized

101
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,759
that cannabis had a lot of medical

102
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,680
properties and it was helping people

103
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,359
live longer better lives and so people

104
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:00,079
like Dennis Peron people like brownie

105
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,360
Mary they pushed really hard uh to to

106
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:05,040
make medical cannabis at least even more

107
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,120
legal I mean San Francisco was

108
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,759
always somewhat tolerated I mean brownie

109
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,319
Mary would come into the hospitals

110
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,239
actually but if the cops wanted to

111
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:14,798
bother you they could and so when it

112
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:16,040
started to get bigger when brownie Mary

113
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,199
would show up at the hospital with pop

114
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,560
brownies when Dennis Peron had his he

115
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,319
had like an open air cannabis club you

116
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,918
know his belief was always any form of

117
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,599
uh cannabis's medicinal cannabis so he

118
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:31,680
wasn't very strict about who he let in D

119
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,840
yeah Dennis was a character for sure

120
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,160
yeah man rest in peace he's the the fair

121

Summer of Love and [Â __Â ] right sure and

223
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:28,000
uh but what I but what I brought to the

224
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,959
game was like they were just I look like

225
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,399
a hippie but I was

226
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:35,360
right sure and uh even though I respect

227
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,000
the hippies and respected the hippies um

228
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,440
but what I brought what I think I

229
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,440
brought to the game was uh just a little

230
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,479
flavor and a work ethic that wasn't

231
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,880
quite that Minnesota work ethic that

232
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:47,320
puran work ethic yeah yeah we're in the

278
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,320
much cuz it obviously is a special town

279
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,320
for many different reason

280
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:36,189
[Music]

281
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:46,759
um it's just like if you know I'm a West

282
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,320
Coast kid and I know this is the south

283
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:51,838
of Spain but it's got a very United

284
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,560
States West Coast vibe in that it's like

285
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,160
it's on the water everybody's cool it's

286
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,879
not you know it's like San Francisco in

287
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,679
the 90s it's not super expensive so you

288
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:02,159
can do your thing you have a little and

289
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:05,958
still be in a band or still DJ or still

290
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:08,078
do art and have a nice apartment and and

291
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:10,039
and kick it and everybody here is cool

292
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:13,239
man I've never I haven't met one

293
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:14,838
[Â __Â ] in Barcelona yet no it's crazy

294
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,919
chill right the search continues I'm

295
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:18,839
sure I'm sure there is one it does a San

296
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:21,439
Diego Vibe a little old school like from

297
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,639
the it do '90s and [Â __Â ] I do not I

298
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,639
disagree I mean just like the looking at

299
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:28,759
the palm trees okay maybe superficially

300
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,799
it has a San Diego Vibe but like the

301
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:32,360
vibe itself

302
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:34,519
San Diego as the West Coast goes is

303
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,399
really closer to Bakersfield than it is

304
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:38,000
to

305
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,000
Portland I'm going be honest Portland

306
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,759
you didn't say like La you said Portland

307
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,519
so that was the two extremes right so I

308
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:47,319
I I agree with that but the weather's

309
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,879
nice the weed's good the food's good

310
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,720
like you said everything's good it's

311
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,399
easy to walk around public

312
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,800
transportation is great so what what's

313
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,320
up with the the coffee shop scene or the

314
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:59,799
social club scene here is it popping is

315
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,519
it uh what what if if for folks who

316
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:05,399
haven't been to Barcelona what can they

317
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,560
expect and can anybody just pop up and

318
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,159
break to while cannabis is still

319
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:11,879
technically illegal in Spain uh their

320
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:14,159
Supreme Court decided a long time ago

321
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:16,480
that you have a right to put drugs in

322
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,759
your body if you want and so they have

323
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,360
social clubs so you have to join a

324
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,639
social club and the social club is

325
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,879
allowed to grow weed for you and you

326
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:25,278
have to know somebody you have to be

327
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,720
sponsored as a member you can't just be

328
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:29,000
walking into the social club you got to

329
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,680
know somebody you got to know somebody

330
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,320
yeah

331
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,799
camera apprciate it it's my fly up too

332
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,839
so you got to know somebody you have to

333
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:37,039
have a letter recommendation to get in

334
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,839
and then when you're in there you can

335
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,838
buy cannabis uh but you're not supposed

336
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,440
to take it with you outside of the club

337
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,800
uh right so nobody ever does that uhuh

338
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,399
right right and and they're all very

339
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:52,639
different some are really like sports

340
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:54,480

341
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,839

342
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,440
some are just like little chill

343
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:00,360
nightclubs or coffee shops and so

344
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,600

345
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,959
find the one you like or there's

346

378
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,240
you've been to Amsterdam and quite a bit

379
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:24,240
and uh We've I I I lived in Amsterdam

380
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,278
for a couple years how does the

381
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:31,000
Amsterdam coffee shop scene compar to

382
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:32,480
the SP Spain social club scene is it I

383
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,039
know it's similar in some ways they're

384
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,480
very similar how's it how's it how's it

385
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,198
what's the different feel the Amsterdam

386
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,320
coffee shop scene is way more wide open

387
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:41,758
right you could just walk in off the

388
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,959
street to any coffee shop and buy a

389
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,720
little something and sit there cons it

390
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:48,000
or take and take it with you although

391
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,879
it's still technically illegal in

392
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,519
Amsterdam it's just uh is there a 5 G

393
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,078
there's a five G thing or something yeah

394
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:56,600
I don't I don't know I mean I never

395
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:57,879
carry more than a few grams on me uh so

396
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,639
I don't know about that but they they

397
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:00,559
also want you to be way more Creet and

398
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:02,039
and I think the problems that they're

399
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:03,359
having in Amsterdam and the problems

400
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:04,599
that they're kind of having in Barcelona

401
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,959
right now because I was talking to some

402
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,959
people and they said they the police

403
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:09,719
have been doing more inspections and

404
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:12,599
they have a new mayor who's maybe not as

405
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,560
happy with cannabis clubs as as the city

406
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,199
used to be and the Dutch are always

407
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,439
trying to kick the tourists out uh up in

408
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:20,719
Amsterdam they're always trying to well

409
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,279
you and you know because people show up

410
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,600
and they especially in Amsterdam they're

411
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,120
kind of drunk and then then they walk

412
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,480
into the coffee shop and then they get

413
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,120
stoned so now they're cross faded right

414
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,278
and they're matur and so now they're

415
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,919
stumbling around they're falling off the

416
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:38,198
thing they're falling in the canal

417
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:39,639
they're starting fights bro yeah the

418
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:43,240
whole point is just to be chill handle

419
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:44,000
your drugs yeah right be an adult yeah I

420
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,799
think

421
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,559
that's I think that's a great philosophy

422
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,879
in general for I try that's that's what

423
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,719
am I have fun be yourself handle your

424
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:56,078
drugs be responsible for your own drug

425
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,399
use yeah right well because we all are

426
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,198
really and truth truth be told I mean

427
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,879
well that's the Mantra you can't

428
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:04,758
legislate morality no but also I mean

429
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,519
but it's also things like this you know

430
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:10,318
like uh I throw cannabis events and I

431
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,839
like to keep them no to low alcohol one

432
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:14,799
it keeps people from getting cross faded

433
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,560
and puking on my on my floors two it's

434
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,439
funny to me to watch the boozers have to

435
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,119
sneak off to a corner to have a drink

436
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,440
and I can come over and bust them you

437
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,120
guys drinking

438
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:29,519

440
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,399

441
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,360
Carl Hart that told me one day don't be

00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:37,198
drug Prejudice no don't be drug

443
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,000
Prejudice and I thought that was so

444
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:41,838
people do drugs man I used to be I mean

445
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,440
I'm not I don't do a lot of drugs I do a

446
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,319
few drugs a lot like I always like to

447
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,639
say but uh I'm I'm more understanding of

448
00:16:46,318 --> 00:16:51,799
people who do drugs that I would

449
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,360
consider my vi just handle it yeah be an

450
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:57,240
adult yeah I I know a guy who's actually

451
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,360
fairly successful uh and he's on micro

452
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,159
does of cocaine almost daily

453
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,038
yeah I know people who take heroin who

454
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:05,519
are successful CEOs so you never know no

455
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:08,240
well I mean never know well Carl Hart

456
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,720
would say uh to invoke uh Dr Kart again

457
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,120
is he said that no matter whether the

458
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,600
drugs are legal or not there's always

459
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,359
going to be a consistent people are

460
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:18,279
going to do drugs and in terms of like

461
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,558
uh doing them responsibly there's like

462
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:23,599
maybe 1.5% or something I don't remember

463
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:26,639
the exact will become addtive addicts to

464
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,318
whatever it to the detriment to the

465
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,960
detriment to their detri not just the

466
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:33,119
habitual user like say a coffee user or

467
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,440
or I guess you have to Define addiction

468
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,439
right that's that's a habit you have to

469
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,480
Define addiction and I guess I guess

470
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,400
ultimately I think we're all addicted to

471
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,440
certain things but caffeine is addictive

472
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,400
nicotine is addictive jogging is

473
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:48,160
addictive yoga is addictive for sure so

474
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,679
like you say to the to the detriment are

475
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,120
you doing it responsibly are you

476
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,120
handling your [Â __Â ] um are you functional

477
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:58,279
in society and high functioning cannabis

478
00:17:55,119 --> 00:18:01,479
user yeah high functioning cannabis user

479
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:01,480

dad um so uh so the coffee so but but

481
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,558
and so you're saying in Amsterdam it's

482
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,839
more it's more wide open and it's more

483
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:16,399
dis it's more discreet in in uh CU I

484
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:18,558
know you don't really see the coffee

485
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,159

490
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:31,918
club and then so you then you press the

doorbell and a little door opens and and

492
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,720

494
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,960
liquor in Amsterdam there was like three

495
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,918
types of coffee shops there was that

496
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,519
like total local coffee shop there was

497
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:47,640
like the the the the total like tourist

498
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:49,960
coffee shop and then there was the

499
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,080
hybrids where the locals and the

500
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,200
tourists were there like remember the

501
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:55,359
roai on lights of roai was very popular

502
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,279
I think I went there I think the last

503
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,839
time I went there was like 2020 right

504
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:00,399
before everything went crazy oh really I

505
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:02,279
was in Amsterdam a year ago and it

506
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,038
doesn't exist any it's not well at least

507
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:05,279
it's not in that place anymore right

508
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:07,759
right right but I thought that was one

509
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:10,079
of the dopest ones and they had they had

510
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:12,200
uh they served alcohol and but not all

511
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,558
coffee shops did serve alcohol and then

512
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,400
there was some places in Amsterdam where

513
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:17,759
you could go that were bars that allowed

514
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,038
smoking yes right but you couldn't get

515
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:22,038
the weed there no and that's that that

516
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:24,679
should be a problem you know if you if

517
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:27,480
you're I mean I think we need more

518
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:29,798
Social Clubs and more I mean a lot of

519
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,798
the times in this push toward toward

520
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:33,960
legalization people are really treating

521
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:35,679
alcohol or not alcohol but cannabis like

522
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,000
it's like it's a shameful dirty drug so

523
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,440
you have to go and you buy your cannabis

524
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,079
and then you go back home and you smoke

525
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,919
your cannabis you know all by yourself

526
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,558
full of shame

527
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,000
but weed is a social drug you stand in a

528
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,279
circle when you smoke it everybody's an

529
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,359
equal everyone's a peer uh cannabis

530
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:53,960
clubs cannabis Social Clubs uh medical

531
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:57,359
cannabis dispensaries they were all kind

532
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,880
of social hubs uh before legalization in

533
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,719
in the states at least and then the

534
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,240
states are like well no nobody can

535
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,000
consume outside you just have to buy it

536
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,480
and go away but the clubs are coming

537
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,839
back and I think we need more of those

538
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,679
we need you should be able to pop down

539
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:10,199
to your local same way you pop down to

540
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:11,280
your local bar and have a drink after

541
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,440
work or whatever you should be able to

542
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,119
pop down to the local have a puff or

543
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,000
have some sort of cannabis cocktail play

544
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,319
some chess with your homies watch the

545
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,319
game or whatever and then go home so

546
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:21,158
that's the one cool thing about

547
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:22,759
Amsterdam though is that it is wide open

548
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:24,919
and you can just have your weed and take

549
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:26,759
it and smoke it and bring it and what

550
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:28,320
generally as long as you're not a dick

551
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:31,200
yeah well that's in general any for

552
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:33,240
anything right yeah um do you think what

553
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,120
do you think what do you think the fate

554
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:39,159
of of Barcelona's uh social club scene

555
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,839
is I don't know enough about the current

556
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:42,880
politics of Barcelona really to talk

557
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:46,678
about it but I hope that they would stay

558
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:49,679
and even be grandfathered into some even

559
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:51,519
more more accepted and and for sure I

560
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,320
think it would be great if uh I mean I

561
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,879
really like this the smooth this and the

562
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:58,359
discretion of it right now I don't think

563
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,919
we necessarily need to see giant ads for

564
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:01,759
can Canabis clubs everywhere people know

565
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,159
where to go the the social media will

566
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:06,440
tell you where to go and the whole point

567
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:08,799
is to ask a homie so but you know where

568
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,919
you don't have to maybe it's not so much

569
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:12,480
a private club as it is now right you

570
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:15,799
become a member you pay a membership fee

571
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,759
you become a member of of the club in in

572
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:19,839
in Spain uh but maybe you could just

573
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,519
have some drop-ins or walk-ins that

574
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:23,918
would be that would be cool yeah I think

575
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:27,079
that's where I mean I it seems like

576
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,240
implementation is 90% of the law and so

577
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:31,918
you know the I mean it wouldn't

578
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,319
hard no but but you're fighting 100

579
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,038
Years of of anti-cannabis propaganda

580
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,119
right you're fighting a small percentage

581
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:40,079
of people who were just going to listen

582
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:42,158
if common sense and science were going

583
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:45,240
to win the day cannabis would have never

584
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:48,960
have been made illegal right so we

585
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,599
have to overcome negative stereotypes

586
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,558
and and negative propaganda and there

587
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:53,959
are a percentage of people that you're

588
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:55,079
not going to reach and those cats are

589
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,240
going to be the loudest and they're

590
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:58,599
going to be the biggest haters and no

591
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,120
matter what you do no matter how you

592
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:02,959
show them that cannabis makes money for

593
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,158
communities cannabis keeps your

594
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,679
communities cleaner and safer cannabis

595
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:10,000
provides good jobs cannabis forides good

596
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,400
training or or whatever

597
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,119
it's win it's a safe access it helps

598
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,120
people with with things they're still

599
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:19,278
going to hate it yeah right and so you

600
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:21,599
have to figure out a way to work

601
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:22,960
around you I mean you could work with

602
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:24,079
them up to a point but they're not

603
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,840
really going to go for so what about

604
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:29,480
social uh clubs in the state are there

605
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:32,240
any places where you can smoke weed

606
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,558
inside not my house you just come

607
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,640
over Colorado do something where they

608
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:39,319
Colorado's just starting some uh

609
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,159
Nevada's got a couple um there's newo in

610
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:43,399
Las Vegas which is on uh indigenous land

611
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,278
so they their rules are completely

612
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:50,798
different but they're opening a whole

613
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:53,079
new uh like a Las Vegas certified social

614
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:55,119
club in Vegas right now but isn't that

615
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:56,839
funny so this is so interesting that I

616
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:59,278
think Vegas used to be so mean about

617
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:01,480
weed they would throw you under for the

618
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:04,480
like 10 years for a joint or whatever oh

619
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:07,038
oh yeah that wasn't that wasn't 1975

620
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,319
1983 they used to have signs up right I

621
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:11,599
mean don't remember that that fear and

622
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:13,278
loathing picture you know but even even

623
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,240
yeah they got all the drugs in the car

624
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:19,558
and the one joint's going to put him for

625
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:21,720
life or whatever pretty much um uh so so

626
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:24,119
but so so so let's talk about Berlin for

627

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,960
to SM smoke in general yeah so so it's

649
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:27,520
so in does not care yeah so you ride

650
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,919
your bike everywhere you eat healthy and

651
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:32,079
you smoke a few cigar and it feels like

652
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,759
weed is legal it feels it feels it's

653
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:35,639
more free even even though it's not

654
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:37,960
technically legal but just the fact that

655
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,720
you can smoke it outside and in America

656
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,278
we smoke outside too right I mean [Â __Â ]

657
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,159
in 30 years ago we'd smoke inside in San

658
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:46,200
Francisco at the con concerts it was

659
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:48,720
just

660
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,278
right it wasn't a thing and then smoking

661
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,960
just got really Taboo in general yeah

662
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,519
it's really funny it's really funny

663
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,759
about that U because you know back in

664
00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:01,278
the more illegal days of cannabis when

665
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:02,558
we go to throw a cannabis event you know

666
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:03,599
I would tell the person who owned the

667
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:04,798
warehouse or whatever listen there's

668
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:06,158
going to be a lot of pot smoke in here

669
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:08,158
and they be that's cool as long as

670
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,799
there's no cigarettes right right and

671
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,000
now you you go to a thing you be like

672
00:25:09,798 --> 00:25:12,720
we're going to throw a cannabis event

673
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,519
they're like uh that's a great idea but

674
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,880
you can't smoke what do you mean we

675
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:17,119

can't smoke cannabis you just we don't

678
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,479
it's a smokefree environment that's my

679
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,640
point right I'm like well then we can't

680

we can't use your Venue I mean listen in

681

smell like weed for a couple of days

683
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,240
after we've left exactly I mean and and

684
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:32,599
I have to tell some people sometimes I'm

685
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,960

697
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,000

709
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:23,000
that was slightly injust but me m meant

710
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:24,480
to be poetic and a Gonzo style saying

711
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,880
that Slovenia was the most cannabis

712
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,079
friendly nation in in the world and it's

713
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,960
