00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:25,639
name is Alex Rogers I am the owner of

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,759
the

29
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,719
ICBC uh like I said I'm fortunate Moen

30
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:34,840
is pan and I am very fortunate to to

31
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:37,118
live here I have helped uh with cannabis

32
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,000
policy for 30 years starting in

33
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:43,200
California then to Oregon and then to

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,239
Germany and now to Slovenia my favorite

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,719
place not in the world but in the galaxy

36
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:51,239
and uh you just have to keep pinching me

37
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:53,000
CU every time I uh wake up and I see the

38
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:56,039
mountains and I smell this fresh air and

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,280
I eat this do I really think that this

40
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:03,239
is a dream here and uh our advant in

41
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,320
Slovenia is that we're small and a lot

42
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:07,000
of people would say that's a

43
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:10,359
disadvantage but I'll tell you right now

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,318
the fact that Slovenia is small and uh

45
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,120
it it makes it Nimble and adaptive and

46
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:18,439
not as bureaucratic as some other places

47
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,959
now if you've been to the Aon anot anota

48
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:23,639
lately maybe you disagree with me but

49
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,199
the truth of the matter is is we create

50
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:29,119
our world and that's what we're doing

51
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:31,518
with cannabis policy uh in Slovenia

52
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,519
there's a lot of exciting things uh to

53
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:38,800
come and uh uh we're here to change the

54
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,840
world uh for everybody because it really

55
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,680
ultimately when you legalize cannabis or

56
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,439
you modernize cannabis policy this is a

57
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,000
compassionate thing and it has to do

58
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:51,598
with civil liberties and and civil

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,639
rights and really no medicinal plant

60
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:58,359
should be illegal um but for some reason

61
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:00,639
uh cannabis has been illegal and we know

62
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,840
why cannabis was made illegal

63
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,559
uh the the general consensus is because

64
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,200
of hemp and so it went again against The

65
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,439
Narrative of the Petro industrial

66
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:12,439
petrochemical industrial complex and

67
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,759
this is back in the 1930s so a lot of

68
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:18,959
people know the history but now's the

69
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:21,039
time for Slovenia uh to modernize their

70
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,840
cannabis policies and I will tell you uh

71
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,798
ladies and gentlemen today we have an

72
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,479

75
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,560
important is we take this energy and

76
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:37,878
