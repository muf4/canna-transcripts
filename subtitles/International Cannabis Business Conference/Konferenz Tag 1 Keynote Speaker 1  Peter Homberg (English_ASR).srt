1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,879
thank you very much for that kind

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,980
introduction and Alex I couldn't have

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,679
said that better what is going to happen

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,138
in Germany is a good thing

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,100
but and as a lawyer you always have

6
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:19,379
about uh it is probably not as

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:22,020
optimistically as optimistic as we all

8
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:25,460
thought a year ago I was standing here

9
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:29,640
at the same desk and was actually asking

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:31,679
what is the government doing what is the

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,079
government do with regard to

12
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,820
recreational what kind of impact it may

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,799
have on the medical Market

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,039
and what I'm going to do within with you

15
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:43,339
within the next 45 minutes is uh have a

16
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:47,280
look at what has happened since then

17
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:51,059
what can we expect what may be the

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,000
impacts on the viable Medical Market for

19
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:56,399
cannabis in Germany and as a good German

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,539
speaker I have my agenda

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,660
oops

22
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,760
they are uh first of all I give you an

23
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:06,000
overview about why what has happened

24
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:08,280
since a year ago uh we will then have a

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,159
look at the so-called two pillar model

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,560
which is uh the plan of the German

27
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,859
government to implement recreational

28
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,799
Cannabis uh in Germany uh we will then

29
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:23,459
of course also have a look into this new

30
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:26,759
draft act which has been leaked it is

31
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:29,219
not yet officially uh released but we

32
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,019
had the chance to look at it and of

33
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:33,179
course what is the time frame what's

34
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,158
going to happen when can we expect the

35
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,979
opening of the market and what is really

36
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,579
the impact and last but not least do we

37
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:44,640
have real positive potential uh with

38
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:46,559
regards to the legalization of cannabis

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,719
and I'd use the short form of

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,820
recreational Cannabis it is actually the

41
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,978
use of cannabis for adult use for

42
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:55,559
recreational purposes that's too long so

43
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:58,859
I just say recreational Academy

44
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,219
so let's look in what has happened in

45
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:06,180
that last year as we all know the

46
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:08,179
government changed in 2021 and the

47
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,459
federal government in the three

48
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:13,378
Coalition parties the social Democrats

49
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:17,699
the green party as well as the free

50
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:20,579
Democrats have actually uh implemented

51
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:23,579
in their Coalition agreement that they

52
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,040
will go for the legalization of cannabis

53
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:30,599
for recreational purposes

54
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:32,840
that was a two sentence statement and in

55
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:36,719
June 2022

56
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:39,598
there was an expert hearing uh initiated

57
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:43,199
by Boca blina uh the drug commissioner

58
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:45,719
in Germany uh to see what are the

59
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:49,560
positive and maybe even negative impacts

60
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:51,659
on the uh legalization of cannabis

61
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,659
recreational purposes

62
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:57,959
uh what has happened the sun is in

63
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:59,759
October 2022 the federal minister of

64
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,080
Health Carl lauderberg actually

65
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:06,719
presented a key Point paper

66
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:09,900
and everybody got very excited about

67
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:12,780
that because it actually had the

68
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,239
framework of a total legalization

69
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,840
program for adults of recreational

70
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:23,519
cannabis it contained very detailed

71
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:26,098
Provisions regarding the cultivation the

72
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,379
distribution and even the control of the

73
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:30,719
distribution everything under government

74
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:32,158
control meaning cultivation under

75
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,560
government control the distribution

76
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:37,739
through license dispensaries and as well

77
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,280
of course as far as possible the use of

78
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:44,219
cannabis by adults so everybody was very

79
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,060
excited but here again there was also a

80
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:47,400
bot

81
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,739
we all know that there are legal hurdles

82
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,780
we discussed that actually a year ago I

83
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:55,860
was actually pointing it out that we

84
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:58,378
have uh the various U.N conventions in

85
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,780
particular the 1961 convention but what

86
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:03,479
is even more important is that the

87
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,539
Schengen agreement itself stipulates

88
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:08,939
very clearly the prohibition of all kind

89
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:11,400
of drugs including cannabis for

90
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:13,259
recreational purposes and the scheng

91
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,840
agreement is the basis for the European

92
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:18,418
Union and of course there are protocols

93
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,600
following the scheng agreement which

94
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:24,779
reiterated that the legalization of

95
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,320
cannabis for educational purposes is

96
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:30,119
prohibited so in 2022 the government the

97
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,759
German government turned around 1080

98
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,399
degrees they clearly stated and argued

99
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:38,580
that the prohibition of recreational

100
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:41,039
Cannabis did not fit the purpose we have

101
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:43,560
an increasing illicit Market giving you

102
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,500
some ballpark figures here the current

103
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:51,120
medicine Market is in the region of 25

104
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:55,259
20 to 25 metric tons a year the illicit

105
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:58,079
Market is around 400 even maybe 600

106
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:00,300
metric tons a year and increasing in

107
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,698
Germany so this gives you a little bit

108
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,040
of an outline what we are talking about

109
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:07,319
here

110
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:10,139
the government actually took that

111
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:12,300
position paper plus the arguments which

112
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:14,519
for the legalization of cannabis which

113
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,579
was very similar as the Canadian have

114
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:20,279
used it of course further protection of

115
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:22,379
the use protection of the consumer in

116
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:25,319
order to increase but by increasing the

117
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:28,219
quality of the respective product and of

118
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:31,319
course attacking the illicit Market

119
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:34,740
the government went to the European

120
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:37,439
Commission in October 2022 with this

121
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,660
position paper and in the informal

122
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:43,740
process asked the European commission

123
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:45,900
can we do it why because the Germany and

124
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,900
the German government was afraid that

125
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:52,258
the European commission and even any of

126
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:55,500
the member states would initiate a legal

127
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:57,720
proceeding for the breach of the Chang

128
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:01,319
agreement before the European court of

129
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,419
justice and those who are familiar with

130
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:06,719
politics and Germany and the European

131
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:10,379
court of justice know that we have lost

132
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,479
just recently big time again Germany has

133
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:15,060
lost recently very big time before the

134
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,439
European court of justice for their data

135
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,560
protection policy so they wanted to

136
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,819
avoid another

137
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,978
Judgment of the European court of

138
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:24,418
justice and have asked the commission so

139
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:27,418
can we do it

140
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:28,859
well what happened is uh and nobody said

141
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:31,680
it's that clearly but I'm going to say

142
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,919
clearly they said no you can't do it

143
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,519
very clearly uh the government was

144
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:40,560
talking about productive talks which

145
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:41,939
they had with the European commission

146
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,879
but they were not that productive to

147
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:47,100
today at least because

148
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:50,038
they did not allow that we are going to

149
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:53,100
implement this love which we had

150
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:56,339
actually envisaged back in October 2022.

151
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,860
so what has happened Plan B Plan B was

152
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:01,198
taken out of the box and plan B is

153
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,840
present was presented in April this year

154
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,400
with a two pillar model which I will

155
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,299
explain in a minute a little bit more

156
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:09,859
detail

157
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:13,620
and this two pillar model is of course

158
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:17,038
compared to the approach of October 22 a

159
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:20,038
real setback to say at least and that is

160
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:21,538
from our point of view disappointing and

161
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:24,478
for the other for the industry is

162
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:27,538
disappointing and what has now come into

163
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:31,139
the discussion what is now stipulated in

164
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:34,918
these new two pillar approach is I would

165
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:36,478
say uh not that promising but we will

166
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:39,359
see that in a minute

167
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:42,598
so the concrete draft law was leaked in

168
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,879
May 2023 so just recently and we will

169
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:47,639
have a look into that law a little bit

170
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,459
more in detail what does the two pillar

171
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:53,160
model of this official key Point paper

172
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:56,038
actually say so that's that's kind of

173
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,560
interesting uh because they uh German

174
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:00,598
government know

175
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,459
took looked into the box so what can we

176
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:03,839
do with regard to the legalization and

177
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:06,659
took everything what they could find

178
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,918
which was in the framework which they

179
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:13,740
believe uh of the European uh

180
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:16,258
agreements and the UN agreements so what

181
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,780
is this two pillar model all about

182
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:21,180
first of all the first pillar which is

183
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:24,119
now under discussion allows the

184
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:28,639
individual sales cultivation of three

185
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,639
female plants per adult in a household

186
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,918
yes oops

187
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:36,899
secondly it is the community

188
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:39,899
self-cultivation a lot we will have the

189
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:42,000
possibility to establish in a German

190
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:44,580
fine structure which you would say is

191
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,839
kind of an association uh it's not a

192
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:51,180
cannabis club as actually uh

193
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:54,660
promoted it's a cultivation Association

194
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:56,419
of up to 500 members who can actually

195
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:59,278
grow cannabis

196
00:08:56,419 --> 00:09:02,039
self-cultivation by the club by the

197
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:05,399
Association by this cultivation

198
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:09,719
Association and of course then forwarded

199
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:12,299
to or hand it over to its members for a

200
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,000
fee the point is this community

201
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:17,879
self-cultivation is this Association is

202
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,799
a non-profit organization that has been

203
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:22,080
clearly stipulated in that draft law and

204
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:24,000
let me come back to that in a minute and

205
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,980
of course the licensing and the

206
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,440
monitoring of these clubs will be done

207
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,360
by the respective State authorities so

208
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,220
that's pillar number one and I'll come

209
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,139
back to that in a minute and there are

210
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,660
some more interesting facts about that

211
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:38,519
second pillar uh is the regionally

212
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:41,519
limited scientifically monitored model

213
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:43,019
project that is possible under the UN

214
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,720
conventions as we all know for

215
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:48,060
scientific purposes that is implemented

216
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,180
already in Switzerland as we know uh

217
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:53,338
earlier this year and the Netherlands

218
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:55,859
are going a similar route maybe not the

219
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:58,920
same and this will be actually

220
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,560
implemented at us in a second step so

221
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:03,360
the first step is self-cultivation

222
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:05,639
individual and community and the second

223
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,379
step is then the pilot project

224
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:12,000
scientifically controlled pilot projects

225
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:13,799
for a duration of five years and of

226
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,080
course only adults with certain Regional

227
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:19,519
limitations I can actually purchase them

228
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,519
we will look into that in a minute

229
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,239
so what does the leaked draft law

230
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:26,939
actually say

231
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,879
so looking into that there are various

232
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:32,399
articles which are kind of interesting

233
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,439
to read it's a relatively long draft to

234
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,799
say at least and we are going to look

235
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,600
into the more important articles right

236
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:41,338
now the first one is of course we are

237
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,620
going to create a new law well that's

238
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:45,420
typically German uh we are going to have

239
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,220
a law which is going to operate in e-law

240
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:50,879
which is called the Cannabis upcarbon

241
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:53,420
gazettes which regulates actually uh in

242
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,980
which way the uh

243
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:57,838
cannabis Association this cultivation

244
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,899
associations can actually distribute

245
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,660
cannabis to their members how they are

246
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,519
established how they can grow and of

247
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:07,860
course also the quality control of the

248
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,200
respective cultivation

249
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:14,278
this article 2 and then think that's

250
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:16,379
that's important uh is a change of the

251
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:18,899
German narcotics Act

252
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:24,600
and this is one of the even more severe

253
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:27,120
changes here because the THC related

254
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,519
products and THC will be taken out of

255
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,919
the German narcotics act and of course

256
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,360
transferred to the new cannabis

257
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:36,419
desensory Act

258
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,600
uh with some changes but that means

259
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:42,719
actually that cannabis products will not

260
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,120
be any more narcotics which has

261
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,019
significant impact and I will come back

262
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,639
to that later also on the medical Market

263
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:53,339
and of course then we're having a look

264
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,519
into the others uh laws which need to be

265
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:59,100
amended and of course also the amendment

266
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:01,500
to the road traffic act an important

267
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,720
issue which sometimes is really

268
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,458
neglected

269
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,459
so let's have a look into a little bit

270
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:11,338
more detail into these his law

271
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:13,679
well uh as I said up to three female

272
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:15,720
plants can be actually grown by each

273
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,599
individual adult individual in the

274
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,879
household and of course combined with an

275
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,060
obligation to prevent the access to

276
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:27,000
minus okay

277
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:29,399
second the respective non-commercial

278
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,639
cultivation of the associations can have

279
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:34,200
up to 500 members and now that's

280
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,559
interesting to see here as well there is

281
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:41,459
a limitation planned for each member

282
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:46,199
over 21 which they can obtain up to 50

283
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:49,458
grams per month uh the adults between 18

284
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:52,560
to 21 years old can only

285
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:53,419
purchase or get actually cannabis

286
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:58,138
flowers

287
00:12:53,419 --> 00:13:01,519
of 30 grams per month with a THC content

288
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,519
of 10 or less

289
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,720
maybe somebody can

290
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,379
educate me how that is going to be

291
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:14,040
controlled uh because that is a plant

292
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:16,740
which we know has uh different specifics

293
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:19,980
of course we can to a certain extent uh

294
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:22,139
have that limitation uh but you know the

295
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,360
question is how is then that be

296
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,759
cultivated so we have here the

297
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,100
cultivation for adults above at 21 and

298
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:32,819
here we have cultivation for the adults

299
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:36,180
between 80 to 21. in fact I believe that

300
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:38,940
this is relatively difficult to uh to

301
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:40,399
establish in particular on a non-profit

302
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,139
basis

303
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,600
whereby the actually draft lawn it's

304
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:47,639
still a draft law says that these

305
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,100
cultivation associations have to finance

306
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:54,360
themselves through the membership fees

307
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:56,759
and uh not from the outside

308
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:00,360
there's a strict advertising ban of

309
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:02,759
course and the Cannabis associations the

310
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,220
cultivation associations have a very

311
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:09,179
strict monitoring and documentation

312
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:12,480
obligation uh towards the authorities

313
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:15,000
which will be randomly checked at least

314
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,339
once a year

315
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,019
what comes along with that is the

316
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:21,240
decrinalization of possession of

317
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:24,659
cannabis in a loud amount we are talking

318
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,459
about 30 grams 25 grams 30 grams which

319
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:31,139
an individual can actually carry without

320
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:32,759
being uh without being punished uh there

321
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:35,220
are certain rules and now we come to the

322
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:37,500
more uh practical side of the

323
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:40,680
consummation which means first of all we

324
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,839
have exclusion zones around areas where

325
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:45,479
children are usually present neighbors

326
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,639
can should not be disturbed in

327
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,940
pedestrian areas the consumption of

328
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:52,919
cannabis is prohibited between eight a.m

329
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:56,160
in the morning till 8 PM in the evening

330
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:58,519
and I'm not kidding that is exactly what

331
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:01,379
the law the draft law says

332
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:02,940
and there will be the introduction of

333
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:05,519
new Criminal Provisions in case of a

334
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,740
violation which will be less strict than

335
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,198
we have it in the narcotics Act

336
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,299
so you see from a practical point of

337
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:15,179
view we have a number of issues which

338
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:17,159
have to be adhered to and maybe that is

339
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:19,439
not what you expected but that's exactly

340
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:21,778
what the draft law currently says which

341
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:25,040
is still under discussion uh in the

342
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:25,039
respective Ministries

343
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:33,980
so the amendment to the narcotics act I

344
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,980
think is is an important issue here

345
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:40,620
uh let's see what the

346
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:45,120
the removal of course of the Cannabis

347
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:46,799
here of the respective act has uh a

348
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,500
certain impact of course on the medical

349
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:52,919
Market as well uh it is will not be

350
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:55,940
longer and narcotic so Physicians will

351
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:59,000
not and we'll see that later not be now

352
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:02,040
prescribing a narcotic this is going to

353
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,039
reduce to a certain extent their

354
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:07,740
reluctancy to prescribe calabas for

355
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:11,278
specific patients uh you know the

356
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:14,639
narcotics prescriptions are read you

357
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:17,578
know it's a different piece of paper and

358
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,500
every time Physicians is using that

359
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:22,319
there's a certain barrier at least

360
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,120
psychologically uh should I or should I

361
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,278
not actually prescribe it and we know

362
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,480
that in the medical Market there's a

363
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:33,600
certain reluctancy of Physicians to

364
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,659
widely prescribe cannabis for for

365
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,220
medical purposes which

366
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:40,198
an obstacle which I think the industry

367
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,360
needs to overcome with further education

368
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:44,578
of Physicians and of course more

369
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,980
information about the use of cannabis

370
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:50,458
for for patients

371
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:52,740
um so the as a result the the btmg will

372
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:55,258
not be longer applicable to cannabis

373
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,299
related offenses uh we will have that

374
00:16:55,259 --> 00:17:01,500
now transferred to the new cannabis act

375
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:04,438
as I said with leveling down uh the the

376
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,900
punishment for The Possession uh and any

377
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:09,798
kind of violations uh with regard to

378
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,798
calabas

379
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,119
so what we're going to do right now is

380
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:19,759
uh look into a little bit more in detail

381
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,759
uh into that act here

382
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,240
um

383
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:28,619
this is the amendment of The the road

384
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,298
traffic act which is sometimes neglected

385
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:32,759
in the discussions but it is important

386
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:36,119
uh and it's addressed in the law as well

387
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:39,298
and we see what actually the uh changes

388
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:42,178
will be we have with regard to alcohol a

389
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:45,418
very clear strict uh threshold and a

390
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:48,780
limit for the consumption of alcohol and

391
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:51,140
then driving this is not yet established

392
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:53,940
for cannabis so if we legalize collabis

393
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:56,940
this is an issue which of course also

394
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,679
the respective police actually the

395
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,798
traffic police brought up and said hey

396
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:05,100
what can we do in order to find a

397
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:09,119
certain kind of thresholds here in that

398
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:12,058
uh in that uh in the level of cannabis

399
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,859
which has been been used by the

400
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:16,079
respective driver and is he fit for

401
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:18,899
driving or not who is going to Jazz it

402
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:20,399
up because uh different from alcohol you

403
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,559
can still have a certain amount of

404
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,080
cannabis in your blood but you're still

405
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,759
100 fit for driving and the other way

406
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:28,500
around so that this will be an

407
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:31,319
interesting discussion of course and

408
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,599
we'll see how that is going to work out

409
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:37,519
they are currently discussing in which

410
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:42,500
way I wonder how can we test that second

411
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:42,500
uh what will be the limits in the future

412
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,720
foreign

413
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:55,579
law it is not as interesting or not as

414
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:58,980
promising as we all uh expected actually

415
00:18:55,579 --> 00:19:01,619
if you look into the leaked draft law uh

416
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,660
the the various Provisions are from our

417
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:08,159
point of view much behind what we have

418
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:11,460
seen in 2022 and now the question is of

419
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:15,480
course how can we react to that uh what

420
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,919
is the the overall possibility in the

421
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,620
future

422
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:23,220
well I think what is important to say is

423
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:29,339
that we have uh

424
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:33,058
the possibility to open at least the use

425
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:36,918
of calabis for recreational purposes uh

426
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:40,740
by by adults which is positive I think

427
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:43,200
however if you look into the respective

428
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:47,058
THC limits which I just addressed for

429
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:50,519
the use of cannabis in the Social Clubs

430
00:19:47,058 --> 00:19:53,940
I don't see that the argument

431
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:56,759
of the government of last year to

432
00:19:53,940 --> 00:20:00,200
protect the youth and further increase

433
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:03,839
the quality for the user

434
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:06,480
of the respective product is is going to

435
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:09,720
be matched by the first pillar here

436
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,579
uh you know the state authorities are

437
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,558
supposed to carry out the random checks

438
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:15,899
they have not yet the infrastructure

439
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:18,019
they do not have Personnel nor do they

440
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:22,080
have the respect respective Financial

441
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:24,418
possibilities to really uh look into how

442
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:26,699
we're going going to uh look into let's

443
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:28,799
say 10 different cultivation

444
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:32,819
associations here in Berlin or let it be

445
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:36,359
five and just calculate you know uh such

446
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:39,359
uh Association if it has 500 members and

447
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:41,759
they are all above 21 uh and they are

448
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:44,219
handing out 50 Rams per month if I'm not

449
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:46,558
mistaken they have to cultivate that

450
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,480
they should cultivate 300 kilograms per

451
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:51,000
year one Club

452
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,679
so now you have to find the space in

453
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,480
Berlin take into consideration that you

454
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:57,720
have to stay away from schools from

455
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,120
kindergartens and and other areas which

456
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,519
are prohibited you maybe you can point

457
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:03,659
out a place in Berlin where we can

458
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:05,639
actually

459
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:08,340
cultivate this

460
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:11,460
uh some of our clients have done that

461
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:13,199
and Frankly Speaking there are not many

462
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,120
places in Berlin where you really could

463
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,980
do that because we have a concentration

464
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,739
of schools and kindergartens and Sport

465
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,558
Sports Arena where you should not grow

466
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,140
uh how should it be grown I think that's

467
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:27,359
important uh

468
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:32,460
indoor growth for recreational Cannabis

469
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:34,519
is not actually already defined uh the

470
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,500
law speaks about greenhouses at least

471
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:40,200
secured greenhouses but it doesn't say

472
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,900
hey what is the quality is it GMP is it

473
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,080
ghcp is it below that or what is the

474
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,700
quality this will probably be more

475
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:50,158
defined in the future

476
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:53,759
and of course the security how should

477
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:57,720
the greenhouses be secured and we all

478
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:59,879
know that the three licensees for for

479
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:03,179
cultivating medical cannabis in Germany

480
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:05,280
had to fulfill significant as that

481
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:08,360
really significant security measurements

482
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:11,339
in order to really cultivate cannabis

483
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:14,639
here in Germany uh the security

484
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:16,558
measurements are are really uh to a

485
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,980
certain extent of course very expensive

486
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:23,038
to establish but will they be applicable

487
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:25,740
also to the cultivation of recreational

488
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:29,700
cannabis in Germany or not uh not really

489
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:32,819
yet uh defined so there are lots of

490
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:36,000
questions lots of issues which the law

491
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:38,599
left leaves open uh in particular on the

492
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,599
Practical side

493
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:41,418
foreign

494
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:52,440
so what we we're going to do see here is

495
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:56,819
indeed changes which are in comparison

496
00:22:52,440 --> 00:23:03,659
to the 20-22nd uh uh

497
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:07,439
approach as really difficult uh the

498
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:12,179
key Point paper of April this year was

499
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,860
is significantly behind the October 2022

500
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:15,900
paper

501
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:19,379
um the situation under International

502
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:22,860
European law was clear from the outset

503
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:25,020
about the German government presented

504
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:28,038
that plan transparently in order maybe

505
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:30,658
to get an exception in a kind of a

506
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:32,460
allowance a nodding from the European

507
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:34,440
commission which unfortunately the

508
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:39,179
commission did not do

509
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:42,480
so it was therefore consistent with its

510
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:43,860
further policy well we have countries in

511
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,919
Germany which are very much supporting

512
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:48,959
the German approach of October 2022. the

513
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:53,280
Czech Republic actually is very much

514
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:56,460
supporting our approach and also has

515
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:59,399
announced that it could be possible that

516
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:01,079
they would legalize and are being drawn

517
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,960
before the European court of justice

518
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:06,720
they would fight it out uh at least that

519
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,179
is what some sources say we'll see

520
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,880
whether this is going to to happen but

521
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:13,740
from our point of view full legalization

522
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,919
will only be possible after the change

523
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:20,819
of the European law uh it will not be

524
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:22,799
possible by any kind of by for the

525
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:26,538
European countries that will not be

526
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:30,440
possible to do that in a different way

527
00:24:26,538 --> 00:24:30,440
which is a long process

528
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:35,759
so have a look into the time frame what

529
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:39,899
can be actually expected

530
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:43,319
well they are first pillar actually uh

531
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:47,100
is now under discussion we have a draft

532
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:50,220
law uh which is going to describe very

533
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:53,819
clearly what are the respective next

534
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:57,179
steps uh and the question is of course

535
00:24:53,819 --> 00:25:00,480
will there be an implementation of the

536
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:02,820
law before the year end well that's why

537
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,099
I said here uh that's the time frame

538
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:05,960
according to our Ministry of Health Mr

539
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:09,379
louder

540
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:11,940
we have been so far A little bit more

541
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:15,539
pessimistic about about the time frame

542
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:18,298
uh the law is yet under discussion

543
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:21,119
between the Mary's Ministries it then

544
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:23,099
has to go actually to the cabinet from

545
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,259
the cabinet it will be presented to the

546
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:27,658
Parliament and then of course we will

547
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:30,058
see whether this can and will be

548
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:33,480
implemented uh will it be before the

549
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:35,819
year end uh I have my doubts on that to

550
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:39,419
be very Frank at least the first pillar

551
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:40,980
it may be beginning of 2024 I would be

552
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:42,480
surprised because take into

553
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:45,599
consideration the political discussion

554
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,519
which we will have about that law and we

555
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,339
have already heard from the more

556
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,200
conservatively governed States in

557
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:55,439
Germany that they are not in favor of

558
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,659
that law that they will lead to have the

559
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,798
discussion within the Parliament and the

560
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:07,039
question is can it be then uh really uh

561
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:09,480
possible to release that new law without

562
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:12,319
the second chamber the so-called

563
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,319
bundesgad

564
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:18,359
all

565
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:20,940
laws or new laws in Germany which have

566
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:22,500
an impact on the various States and the

567
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,620
question is how big that impact should

568
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:27,659
be need to be through or need to be

569
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:31,399
confirmed by the bundesrat with the

570
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:34,200
second chamber which consists of the uh

571
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:36,200
member states of the states in Germany

572
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,259
and we have currently

573
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:42,419
a conservatively

574
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:45,658
majority rules majority in the

575
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:50,759
bundeslaud so we see some obstacles here

576
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:54,000
and we'll see what is possible if this

577
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:55,379
law will come into the parliament I

578
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,759
believe that the conservatively

579
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:03,240
government States will definitely oppose

580
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:05,278
any kind of approach which when they

581
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:08,640
presented this new law and the position

582
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:12,419
paper in April say we don't need the

583
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,940
bundescard for this law you can argue

584
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:17,220
that and we'll see what that's what the

585
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,558
uh what the discussion will bring out if

586
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,839
that will be the case the whole process

587
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:23,879
will be further prolonged and we will

588
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,558
probably see that not happening before a

589
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,760
bit of 2024

590
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:32,879
and let's see what the outcome will be

591
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:34,679
we do not believe that the yet discussed

592
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,960
draft law will be in the cabinet before

593
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:37,980
the summer break which is starting in 14

594
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,100
days

595
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:43,140
so uh uh it will be property officer

596
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:45,599
break in September and then of course

597
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:48,120
the whole process will start which means

598
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:50,399
our beginning of 2024 is more realistic

599
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:51,479
than anything in 2023 for the first

600
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,120
pillar

601
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,700
the second pillar actually the law will

602
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:59,879
be released after the summer break why

603
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:02,298
this has been not done together with the

604
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:06,059
first pillar well good question

605
00:28:02,298 --> 00:28:07,319
my favorite solution in case in case the

606
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:08,879
European commission would not have

607
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:10,918
approved the first approach it was the

608
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,080
second pillar let's do scientific

609
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,840
control projects I wrote it out over

610
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:18,359
Germany and have it controlled it's very

611
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:22,319
similar to to Switzerland in order to

612
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:24,058
really have an access uh for for the

613
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:25,319
adults to the use of recreational

614
00:28:24,058 --> 00:28:27,538
cannabis

615
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:30,960
well unfortunately that has not happened

616
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:35,579
so that's the timeline here

617
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,919
so what is the potential impact of the

618
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:40,500
legalization here

619
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,538
well let's have a look at that chart uh

620
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,599
the numbers are not for me to say at

621
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:48,298
least uh and it's it's interesting to

622
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:51,000
see that it's an exemplary calculation

623
00:28:48,298 --> 00:28:55,980
of Professor halcup of the University of

624
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,900
Dusseldorf they are have compared the

625
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:01,140
fiscal impact

626
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:03,480
of the two pillar model in comparison to

627
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,240
the potential full legislation

628
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:10,500
and as you can see while we don't have a

629
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,359
calabas tax on the first pillar and for

630
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,000
all those who are going to export

631
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:16,918
cannabis products into Germany the first

632
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,440
pillar is anyway not interesting because

633
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:22,919
it's self-cultivation at home or in this

634
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,679
uh respective cannabis clubs on the

635
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:29,520
second pillar we'll see the government

636
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:31,820
still said hey we prefer domestic

637
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:35,519
cultivation even for the second pillar

638
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:37,379
compared to imports from outside uh

639
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:39,139
whether this will still be the case take

640
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:42,059
into consideration the potential

641
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:45,299
quantity which may be needed to fulfill

642
00:29:42,058 --> 00:29:47,879
the needs of those who may qualify for

643
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:50,099
the scientific pilot projects is a

644
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,460
different question and not yet solved

645
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:56,278
income tax well uh it's it's one tenth

646
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:58,798
of what we have uh actually uh as a

647
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:00,839
potential full legislation income uh

648
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,519
Social Security well if you compare that

649
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:05,459
all together here

650
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:08,398
um and a very questionable the police

651
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:11,399
expenses and the legal expenses here I I

652
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:13,199
believe they are they are probably not

653
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:16,979
really a saving

654
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:20,880
um we have a total of 1.1 billion euros

655
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:23,940
for the two pillar model and 4.7 billion

656
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,919
of income uh in this in the full

657
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:30,419
legalization process

658
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:33,860
so uh obviously that was not a major

659
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:38,640
argument for the legislator right now

660
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:40,979
so uh what is the potential impact on

661
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,399
the medical Market we discussed that

662
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:46,860
actually uh two days ago at the uh

663
00:30:43,398 --> 00:30:48,898
investors Forum uh and it was kind of

664
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:51,778
interesting to see also the approach of

665
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:54,058
the industry on that and I'm going to

666
00:30:51,778 --> 00:30:56,480
share that to a certain extent I think

667
00:30:54,058 --> 00:31:02,099
it's it's what is definitely happening

668
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:05,278
is that with the reduction of uh the

669
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:07,980
Cannabis what the exclusion of calibers

670
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:10,140
from the narcotics act we have an

671
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,839
increase of prescriptions automatically

672
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:16,200
well on the other hand we know that we

673
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:18,058
have a large number of self-payers

674
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,000
currently I don't know whether you're

675
00:31:18,058 --> 00:31:23,759
familiar with that Health Care system in

676
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,558
Germany we have a so-called statutory

677
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:28,099
health insurance everybody has to be

678
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:31,440
insured Health insured

679
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:35,519
and these statutory Health insurances

680
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:39,480
are going to reimburse the patients also

681
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:42,179
for cannabis products if there is an

682
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:46,140
approval which is kind of

683
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:48,419
an exception because other products you

684
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:50,759
don't need a prior approval in order to

685
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:52,799
be reimbursed so what is going to happen

686
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:55,319
the patient is going to his doctor the

687
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:57,000
doctor says yes uh you uh I would like

688
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:59,639
to use cannabis for the treatment of

689
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,798
your disease now a statutory Health

690
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,880
injured patient has to file an

691
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:05,099
application to the health insurance

692
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,320
together with his doctor

693
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:10,019
that will be approved or not approved we

694
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:13,259
will see that in a minute uh and in in

695
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:17,158
60 65 percent of the cases we have an

696
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:19,679
approval so then actually the doctor can

697
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:21,299
prescribe cannabis the patient takes the

698
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,600
prescription to the pharmacy and is

699
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:25,558
going the pharmacy is going to be

700
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:28,439
reimbursed by their respective health

701
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:31,079
insurance so that is uh what is going

702
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,298
going to happen we have of course a

703
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:35,819
number of patients who do not want to go

704
00:32:33,298 --> 00:32:37,679
through that burden they do not want to

705
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:41,939
apply to their Century health insurance

706
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:44,100
they are self-payers they just pay it to

707
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:47,038
the pharmacy and are not going to be

708
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:48,480
inversed how large that group is is

709
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:51,000
difficult to judge because they don't

710
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,038
appear in any kind of Statistics there

711
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,038
is a belief that we have around

712
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:59,099
40 maybe 50 maybe even 60 percent of

713
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:01,019
self-payers of the whole market so are

714
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:04,259
they moving over to the recreational

715
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:07,200
Market yes or no uh it's a question uh

716
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:08,819
which I think is is still open and we

717
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,500
can have a look into what what has

718
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:15,658
happened in Canada

719
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:19,140
uh so as you can see here uh the impact

720
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:20,880
in Canada was to a certain extent uh

721
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:24,538
more significant than what we actually

722
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,059
expect here in Germany uh and I think

723
00:33:24,538 --> 00:33:30,119
that's that's important to say because

724
00:33:27,058 --> 00:33:32,398
Canada doesn't have any kind of

725
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:34,739
statutory health insurance as we have it

726
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:36,839
here in Germany with the consequence

727
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:39,778
that of course those who are going to

728
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:43,139
reimburse rather would stay with the

729
00:33:39,778 --> 00:33:46,798
prescription and be reimbursed then move

730
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:50,278
over to be self-payers uh but the the

731
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:53,460
development actually uh from my point of

732
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:57,480
view is difficult to uh be transferred

733
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:59,220
to the to the German uh situation uh

734
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,399
because of the health insurance system

735
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:05,100
uh and here we have some fix and figures

736
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:07,619
from Obama is that Casa which is one of

737
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:08,719
the statutory health insurance and they

738
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:13,019
say

739
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:15,178
at Burma 79 of the patient applications

740
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:18,300
for medical cannabis were approved in

741
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:20,338
2021 which is a great number the average

742
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:24,300
as I said is somewhere in the region

743
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:25,918
between 60 to 65 and there are further

744
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,720
applications by the way are not

745
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:30,898
necessary you don't have to apply every

746
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:33,118
time you're going to be reimbursed or

747
00:34:30,898 --> 00:34:35,638
being getting a prescription

748
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,379
so it's reasonable to assume that the

749
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:39,838
patient pool will stay relatively

750
00:34:37,378 --> 00:34:43,098
consistent at least those who are going

751
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:43,099
to be reimbursed

752
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,659
so what is the further impact here I

753
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:52,440
think that's that's interesting to see

754
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:55,559
as well uh the

755
00:34:52,440 --> 00:35:00,000
most important factor is the question of

756
00:34:55,559 --> 00:35:04,199
how do we going to uh Define the quality

757
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:08,639
of medical and of recreational that is

758
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:10,439
something which is not yet defined how

759
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:13,259
does the production facility look like

760
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:16,500
what are the price structures of course

761
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:18,420
also of the medic of the medical command

762
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,460
of is in comparison to the recreational

763
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,338
cannabis for the recreational Cannabis

764
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:24,659
as I said in the first pillar but we I

765
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:27,480
don't know whether this is really

766
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:30,960
economically feasible of a club for this

767
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:33,838
500 members on a non-profit basis to

768
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,240
really grow cannabis there need to be

769
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:39,539
solutions from my point of view to work

770
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:41,098
together even to have uh cannabis clubs

771
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:43,320
and archives associations cultivation

772
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:46,680
associations combined in order to grow

773
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:49,380
cannabis uh and not leave it to the 500

774
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:51,179
members to grow it somewhere in the

775
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,039
backyard of the of the respective

776
00:35:51,179 --> 00:35:55,379
Association

777
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:57,300
uh in Canada actually the legalization

778
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,519
has led to supply of shortages for

779
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,680
patients as many producers turned

780
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:04,619
against medical cannabis are in favor

781
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:06,419
for the recreational Market uh whether

782
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:09,780
this is applicable in Germany is also a

783
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:14,099
question well the point is or despite

784
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:15,480
pillar one for pillar 2 where do we get

785
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:18,059
the Cannabis from

786
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,940
we have three licensed producers who can

787
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:23,159
to a certain extent ramp up uh

788
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:27,119
constantly from the group from Demi

789
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:30,420
concept we can do 20 tons a year

790
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:32,760
uh currently you know these cannabis

791
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:37,500
license cannabis producers in Germany

792
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:39,420
are allowed to produce 10.4 tons

793
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:43,440
in four years

794
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:47,519
which is 2.6 tons in a year by three

795
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:50,480
licensees plus 10 percent uh in addition

796
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:55,139
which is only a fraction of the market

797
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:57,179
and we don't know how the future will

798
00:36:55,139 --> 00:36:58,319
look like we have not seen any sign from

799
00:36:57,179 --> 00:37:01,618
the Bay Farm whether they're going to

800
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,720
Tender out for medical cultivation for

801
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:07,260
the next four years because only for a

802
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:09,980
four-year contract so that's uh also a

803
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:14,040
question whether the three licensees

804
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:15,599
could actually Supply that second pillar

805
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:16,739
Market

806
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,660
um

807
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:21,358
from my point of view if you really

808
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:24,480
wrote that out on a broadly basis not

809
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:27,598
possible uh even if they they start

810
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,599
building new facilities uh which takes

811
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:34,440
some time as we all know I rather see

812
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:36,300
the if we really have an demand of a

813
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:39,300
recreational cannabis for that second

814
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:42,960
pillar uh I really see the possibility

815
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:45,300
to for exporters here as well to what

816
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,059
extent difficult the government still

817
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:50,579
says we would like to have domestic

818
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:54,420
Supply also for the second pillar will

819
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:58,640
that be practical well we'll see I have

820
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,639
my doubts on that to say at least

821
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:05,460
so if we look into what has happened so

822
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:09,539
far and what we can expect here uh

823
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:11,820
the overall or the key Point papers as I

824
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:13,940
said is a little bit behind it

825
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:17,160
um the

826
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:20,720
various EU members are actually going to

827
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:23,239
try to influence the

828
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:27,179
respective uh

829
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:28,459
developments in the European Union in

830
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:31,078
the European Union

831
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:32,820
and I think what is important and I

832
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:35,700
would really like to cite that because

833
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:38,519
that's so interesting is from the key

834
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:40,559
Point paper of April 2023

835
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:43,500
at the same time

836
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:45,059
the federal government is continuing its

837
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,159
efforts to promote

838
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:48,239
its approaches among its European

839
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:51,000
partners

840
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:52,739
including examining the extent to which

841
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,539
it will be possible for a sufficient

842
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:56,578
number of EU member states

843
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:58,380
to take the initiative in order to make

844
00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:01,380
the relevant EU legal framework more

845
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:03,000
flexible and develop it further in the

846
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,400
medium term

847
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,619
that's the statement I think that's a

848
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,639
positive statement but what is medium

849
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:10,858
term

850
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:13,799
so we're talking about five years

851
00:39:10,858 --> 00:39:15,719
talking about six years where maybe we

852
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,480
have another change in the government in

853
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:20,819
Germany uh I think the actions are not

854
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,000
mistaking us sometime next year so this

855
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:25,859
will be a kind of a different difficult

856
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,500
different approach here but without

857
00:39:25,858 --> 00:39:31,440
changing the EU framework

858
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:35,219
it will not be possible to really uh

859
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:37,980
cultivate distribute cannabis for

860
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:41,039
recreational purposes in Germany

861
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:43,858
and in the European Union

862
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:46,440
so the German system even if it's a

863
00:39:43,858 --> 00:39:50,039
first step and that's what I said at my

864
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:52,260
at my beginning is a good step forward

865
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:54,000
we will hear today in the various

866
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:58,140
discussions of the on the panel here

867
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,480
what is uh the ID what are the ideas of

868
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:04,679
the implementation how should it be done

869
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,480
uh what is actually uh the the Cradle of

870
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:10,139
the current government in order to

871
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:13,820
implement uh the legalization of

872
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:13,819
cannabis for recreational purpose

873
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:20,280
having said that I'm going to finish I

874
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:22,679
think we have a very positive way in the

875
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:26,160
front of us in Germany it is not as

876
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:28,559
quick it is not as intense as we

877
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:30,118
actually expected it back in October

878
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:34,139
2022.

879
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:36,980
but it is a good step forward it is as

880
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:40,739
long lasting process which needs support

881
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:43,980
of all uh all stakeholders in the

882
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:45,598
industry of not only the lawyers who are

883
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,880
doing the administrative work and trying

884
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,880
to do some loving but of course of all

885
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:53,700
the associations we have about all the

886
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,400
stakeholders in the industry in order to

887
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:59,098
really make that happen and will Germany

888
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,380
make that happen yes it will

889
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:01,850
the question is only when thank you very

890
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:05,420
much

891
00:41:01,849 --> 00:41:05,420
[Applause]

892
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,720
we have

893
00:41:10,858 --> 00:41:15,598
if anyone has any questions they want to

894
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:17,939
ask Peter you can maybe raise your hand

895
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,619
we can come down to you I have one over

896
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:21,000
here and there's also microphones there

897
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:23,338
in there if you're in the back we'll

898
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,659
start with this guy here

899
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:26,219
hi there

900
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:28,920
um my name is since all partanski I'm

901
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:30,419
one of the exhibitors here and I'm based

902
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:34,980
out of California

903
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:37,320
so has anyone on your team specifically

904
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:40,079
looked at the market boom bus cycles

905
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,300
that different independent markets in

906
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,200
the United States have gone through

907
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:45,660
mostly because of the correlation

908
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:47,759
between the black market and Regulation

909
00:41:45,659 --> 00:41:50,759
and taxes because

910
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,320
I I saw the presentation doesn't seem

911
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,760
like that's really a sensitivity and I

912
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,320
think that's probably Paramount for you

913
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,420
to look at

914
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,700
yeah we have looked at you are sitting

915
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:02,159
actually four rows below my colleague

916
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:04,078
Eric Berlin who is here today he's

917
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:06,719
heading the U.S cannabis practice

918
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,060
attendance and we are of course steady

919
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,459
contacting uh each other and discussing

920
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:13,460
what are the various developments in

921
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:17,338
different states in in the United States

922
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:20,460
uh some of the measurements can be taken

923
00:42:17,338 --> 00:42:23,099
as an example and can actually also uh

924
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:24,740
be positively used for the discussion

925
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:28,800
which we have currently here in Germany

926
00:42:24,739 --> 00:42:31,039
uh and indeed we have last the week

927
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,359
before last week a meeting with

928
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,460
representatives from the Ministries at

929
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:37,559
our offices together with the industry

930
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:40,740
representatives and of course although

931
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:43,139
the associations and we have discussed

932
00:42:40,739 --> 00:42:46,139
the current draft it's still a draft

933
00:42:43,139 --> 00:42:48,679
whether we see that in that form is

934
00:42:46,139 --> 00:42:52,139
still questionable it is still a process

935
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:54,419
what I presented here is what this what

936
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:56,098
this draft says whether it will be

937
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,900
really into the camera in it and through

938
00:42:56,099 --> 00:43:00,119
the parliament in the same form is still

939
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,460
a question but that's what they actually

940
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:05,220
uh what they actually have proposed we

941
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:07,440
discussed that with the various members

942
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:10,980
of the Ministries and they saw the

943
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,740
difficulties uh which in fact in

944
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:16,079
particular the first pillar will have uh

945
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:18,000
and uh you know the question is also

946
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,460
where do we get the seats from are there

947
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,420
any seat exporters here in the room yep

948
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:26,818
uh it is definitely interesting for you

949
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:29,700
because if you have seeds which are

950
00:43:26,818 --> 00:43:33,000
approved for import into Germany for the

951
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:36,719
cannabis clubs that is definitely a step

952
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,000
forward you can do that and then how do

953
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:41,459
those who do homework at their seats

954
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,260
well they get from the cannabis clubs

955
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,179
even if they are not member they have to

956
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,980
go to a member that's what this law says

957
00:43:45,179 --> 00:43:49,078
and it's not my idea they have to go to

958
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,420
a member and then go to the Cannabis

959
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:53,220
Club and then actually get their seats

960
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:55,338
for growing the three female plants at

961
00:43:53,219 --> 00:43:55,338
home

962
00:43:56,699 --> 00:44:01,739
so it's not a joke that's that's really

963
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:04,199
what this knob says uh and and the

964
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:07,799
question is whether it will be possible

965
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:11,838
for home Growers to really order seeds

966
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:14,300
from uh approved uh approved companies

967
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:18,239
and with the approved

968
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:20,160
a variety of seeds is is an open

969
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:23,699
discussion it's it's an open discussion

970
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:25,139
but not in the law yet so uh these are

971
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:26,159
the discussions which are currently

972
00:44:25,139 --> 00:44:28,139
going on but thank you very much for

973
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:29,940
your question thank you Bo

974
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:31,799
o yeah my name is Beau Whitney from

975
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:34,619
Whitney economics I'm based out of

976
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,880
Oregon but we do Global forecasting in

977
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:37,858
the space

978
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:41,099
um the data that I'm going to present

979
00:44:37,858 --> 00:44:42,838
tomorrow at 10 15. reflects a lot of

980
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:45,780
what you're saying

981
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:48,838
um in terms of you know requirements and

982
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:50,700
ramps and impacts and all this and I

983
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:53,219
actually have a forecast going out to

984
00:44:50,699 --> 00:44:55,679
2030 for Germany

985
00:44:53,219 --> 00:44:59,699
um but my question is

986
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:02,098
um in terms of influencing EU policy and

987
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:05,699
in terms of making an accelerating

988
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:08,818
reform uh could it would it be possible

989
00:45:05,699 --> 00:45:11,759
if multiple countries like Germany Czech

990
00:45:08,818 --> 00:45:16,858
Republic and others team up and then

991
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:18,839
Force the eu's hand and then also second

992
00:45:16,858 --> 00:45:20,759
question is where does Malta play into

993
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:22,858
this because Malta is doing some good

994
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,720
stuff on the medical side but they're

995
00:45:22,858 --> 00:45:27,179
not necessarily supporting the the

996
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:29,519
recreational side but you know where

997
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:31,799
does Malta play into all this as well

998
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:33,960
thank you very much for the question uh

999
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:36,960
indeed very interesting I try to address

1000
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:39,659
that uh during my my presentation uh

1001
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:42,119
that is actually the plan uh those

1002
00:45:39,659 --> 00:45:44,159
countries who are in favor of the

1003
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:45,900
legalization of cannabis recreational

1004
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:48,059
purposes have to team up with in the

1005
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,740
European Union uh and Germany will

1006
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:51,980
obviously that's what we have heard here

1007
00:45:49,739 --> 00:45:56,519
as well hopefully take the lead on that

1008
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:58,318
uh but you know we have different member

1009
00:45:56,519 --> 00:46:00,420
states and different sizes of member

1010
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:02,639
states if you look into France for

1011
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,559
example we don't see much of a movement

1012
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:07,980
in that direction uh the opposite of the

1013
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:10,078
case actually if we look into the Czech

1014
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:13,260
Republic they are supporting it Spain

1015
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:16,079
Portugal may also be very supportive on

1016
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:19,440
that Denmark maybe but there are other

1017
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:21,780
countries which Hungary for example uh

1018
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,780
who are also members of the European

1019
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:27,900
Union may see that differently so it's

1020
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:29,880
it's it's an uphill battle uh to say at

1021
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:34,260
least and there are a lot of of

1022
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:37,200
obstacles but the more member states are

1023
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:40,020
joining forces the better is the

1024
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:43,980
possibility that the EU commission is

1025
00:46:40,019 --> 00:46:45,780
going to think things through it is not

1026
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:48,719
you can't force them

1027
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:50,160
uh that's that's the point Maita is a

1028
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:52,078
very interesting development it would be

1029
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:54,000
going too far to go into details here

1030
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:57,060
with regard to their Club system and and

1031
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,179
the recreational side uh but it's it's a

1032
00:46:57,059 --> 00:47:03,480
if I may say so and I hope nobody is

1033
00:47:00,179 --> 00:47:06,980
here from it's a small member State uh

1034
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:09,420
with not that significant influence uh

1035
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:11,099
that's that's the point but we can learn

1036
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:13,019
from them I think what they have done

1037
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:15,980
and in which way it has been done

1038
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:15,980
thank you for your question

1039
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:21,739
[Applause]

1040
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:21,739
again
