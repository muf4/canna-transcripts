hello everybody

76
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,120
[Music]

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,560
we are making rolling papers as

78
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,120
we have explained

79
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,439
and uh we are kind of a dinosaur in this

80
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,480
industry because uh

81
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,800
rowing producing rolling papers has been

82
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,878
for over 100 years and

83
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,599
everything here is

84
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:23,679
very new less than 10 years old

85
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,439
so and we are getting banned from all

86
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,760
sides so we are getting banned from the

87
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,680
smoking site and we are getting banned

88
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:33,840
from the cannabis side so we cannot

89
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,840
promote ourselves anyway almost

90
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,599
as

91
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,759
many of you know

92
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,759
now the plain tobacco packaging is

93
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,439
arriving and some

94
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,039
some countries consider

95
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,120
rolling papers to be

96
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,560
tobacco accessory

97
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,360
and so

98
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,598
we are getting afraid that

99
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,239
the possibility of

100
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,438
putting a design on rolling papers will

101
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,480
not be

102
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:02,079
possible in the future so some countries

103
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,639
already introduced it

104
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,879
and there is no possibility that

105
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,279
rolling paper booklet

106
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:11,840
can have a design on it so

107
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,519
we are also struggling a little bit and

108
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,358
as you know the ways of consumption

109
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,478
cannabis also are changing so you have

110
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:24,159
now edibles you have vapes you have

111
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,159
drinks you have everything so

112
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,720
we are okay but

113
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,160
new new things are coming

114
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,280
thank you very much

115
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,120
jory

116
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:38,159
and as you can see uh cannabis marketing

117
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,000
differs from other marketing strategies

118
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,919
the reason is

119
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,639
the product is illegal in a lot of

120
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:46,478
countries it's connected to

121
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,960
smoking

122
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:52,560
in germany or in other countries where

123
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:54,638
medical cannabis is at least legal but

124
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,199
you are not allowed to advertise for

125
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,000
your product because as a pharmaceutical

126
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,879
in the whole eu you're not allowed to do

127
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,759
normal advertising for your product and

128
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:08,000
cbd in many countries is still

129
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,400
considered as a part of the cannabis

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,560
plant and also illegal

131
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:15,120
and i think marina can tell us something

132
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,600
about that because um cannabis cbd

133
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,319
marketing in slovenia is not so easy is

134
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,240
it

135
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,599
no you cannot tell

136
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,840
it's not allowed

137
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,639
to

138
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:29,279
um do any marketing whatsoever because

139
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,879
we cannot claim anything

140
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,799
if you have

141
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,279
written cbd on

142
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,319
social media you get banned

143
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,638
and

144
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:42,000
everything else so we tried to do it a

145
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,400
bit differently we did it through um

146
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
unique design and try to stand out with

147
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,399
the

148
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
something that is different on the shelf

149
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:55,599
so if someone goes to we tried we we

150
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,918
were selling in dm the remark stores in

151
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,319
slovenia in 95 shops

152
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:03,918
so if someone goes to drug remark they

153
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,840
surely notice us because we differ

154
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:06,719
and

155
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:08,799
um

156
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,600
a lot of people don't know much about

157
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,079
cbd i think that's the problem also

158
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,879
another one

159
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:20,079
so it takes a lot of

160
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,759
education to tell people what this is

161
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,839
what this does

162
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,759
and this is really hard because you

163
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,478
cannot make any claims

164
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,038
we we try to do it with different

165
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:34,560
ingredients we put inside so for example

166
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:36,560
we have a magnesium lotion with cbd

167
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,560
which relaxes you

168
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,720
and cbd

169
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,680
we cannot claim that cbd does that but

170
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,400
we can claim for magnesium to do that so

171
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,879
there are certain ways to do it if you

172
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:54,959
want anything right but still not online

173
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,839
if you go online you need an expert like

174
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,000
like

175
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,198
mikhail

176
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,519
but

177
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,840
otherwise we do it through interviews in

178
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:08,000
the magazines

179
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:11,279
through educational process and so on

180
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
but i also can say as an influencer i'm

181
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,918
i myself i'm also quite experienced also

182
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,319
with my youtube channel since long years

183
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:20,079
i'm on instagram i'm quite experienced

184
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,439
in

185
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:26,000
marketing of cannabis products and i

186
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:29,598
must admit it's not easy even for people

187
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,800
who are experienced with social media

188
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:35,680
the topic cannabis it is not easy and

189
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,199
it's not only recreational cannabis also

190
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,360
also the

191
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:43,598
the topic medical cannabis and cbd is

192
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,840
for it is not easy for influencers a lot

193
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:48,159
of people who are also very experienced

194
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:51,359
are surprised because all the social

195
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,240
media they change rules like i feel like

196
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,120
every second month mike my question to

197
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,879
you

198
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,680
you know both markets you know the u.s

199
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,759
market you know the european market and

200
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,199
as we uh talked before

201
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,800
you use

202
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,038
influenza you use uh like uh marketing

203
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,240
tools in the social media tell us about

204
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,240
that please

205
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,319
uh sure it's just like you're saying is

206
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,240
that uh even being an expert in the

207
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,639
field it's really hard uh because you

208
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,759
never know what's gonna happen um i have

209
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,680
a page

210
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,680
on facebook where where is kind of where

211
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,280
i do most of my activism called the mike

212
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,000
y show um this page got shut down i mean

213
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,918
pretty much for an entire year my reach

214
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,080
was restricted and so a lot of people

215
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,478
will talk about being shadow banned but

216
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,158
i actually had messages from facebook

217
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,120
saying my reach is restricted i would

218
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:43,200
make a post and it would get maybe 10 or

219
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,600
20 likes when normally i make a post and

220
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,720
it gets 1000 shares so it's quite a

221
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,879
difference

222
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,879
as of two months ago

223
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,799
they lifted the ban

224
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,039
so i put several videos that have gotten

225
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,039
millions of views

226
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,120
since then that time so i'm happy that

227
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:02,559
the restrictions have been lifted

228
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,759
but it is tough uh in the usa you can

229
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:07,599
definitely get away with a lot more

230
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,720
there isn't as many restrictions on

231
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,680
marketing

232
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,720
online they always crack down

233
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,799
there's no way to know if or when

234
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,920
so it's just about being careful about

235
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,838
what you put

236
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:23,679
a lot of what i do is not direct

237
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,160
advertising it's kind of

238
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:28,000
sharing stories and testimonials of

239
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,679
people who are healing from cannabis so

240
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,080
they'll say oh i used cannabis and it

241
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,079
helped me and so people like this this

242
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,519
type of content i think it's kind of

243
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,560
fresh not a lot of people do this um

244
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,560
so

245
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,958
that's kind of how i

246
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:45,599
help to get the message out there is to

247
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,838
just have people tell you firsthand from

248
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,480
their experience their uses with the

249
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,800
plant instead of me interjecting oh yes

250
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,680
cannabis is good and it can do this

251
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,278
i'm not making the claims they are so

252
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,278
here

253
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:02,799
here it seems to be successful to do

254
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:06,559
kind of similar strategies as well um

255
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:09,039
but yeah yeah it's still i can agree uh

256
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:11,518
it's still uh you do not know the rules

257
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,519
so you kind of have to test it out you

258
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,078
have to try something out and sometimes

259
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,240
it works and sometimes it's bad yeah

260
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:21,679
because it's not in my eyes it's not uh

261
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,799
so uh heavy or so uh

262
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,278
it's not

263
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:28,399
too uh you you have the ideas the ideas

264
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:30,958
they they they are not so hard to get

265
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,480
but uh it's really hard to realize them

266
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,759
without being bad

267
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,519
yeah because you always have the injury

268
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,439
you must not name what you what you what

269
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,440
you actually want to say that's that's

270
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,839
the trick jury

271
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,240
let me ask you please um

272
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,920
as a tobacco and cannabis related

273
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,079
product

274
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,919
you have free i think you also have a

275
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:53,599
lot of problems on social media so you

276
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:56,240
have to focus on the design how

277
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,000
important is the design for your product

278
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,360
for a product to be marketed

279
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,320
tell me once again

280
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,839
how important is the design of your of

281
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,839
your specific product we're talking

282
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:12,640
about papers to for for your marketing

283
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,760
well uh of course the design is very

284
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,759
important and it's the only thing we can

285
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,919
do actually we can take a picture of

286
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,159
rolling paper booklet and show it but we

287
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,439
are a business to business company so we

288
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,759
are not

289
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,760
not building our brand so much because

290
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,480
we are producing for other brands we are

291
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:33,200
like a b2b company and it's also

292
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,440
difficult to promote ourselves on social

293
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,920
media and on everything else because

294
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,880
everything is more b2c not so much b2b

295
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,879
so

296
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:45,519
in the past because as i told you we are

297
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,559
in this industry for 20 years already

298
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,039
we were

299
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,879
visiting all the trade shows

300
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:53,759
we use like the

301
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:56,480
some traditional marketing approaches we

302
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,919
call clients we meet with them so

303
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,360
we don't

304
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:03,120
we don't uh do so much social media also

305
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,440
although we have to do it

306
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,240
and as i explained on social media we

307
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,000
are

308
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,919
putting some pictures

309
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,240
of booklets and

310
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:15,120
things

311
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,360
um as i remember

312
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,919
your your product was the first with

313
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,839
those folded inlays and stuff like this

314
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,559
you know what i mean that was your

315
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,399
product was the first

316
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:27,919
yeah with the filters and that you that

317
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,320
you that so

318
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,240
how important was that to make your

319
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,240
product successful because i know i know

320
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,240
the snail papers and i was released when

321
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,240
i first held them in my hand i was i was

322
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,000
thinking oh somebody thought about

323
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,039
rolling papers

324
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,720
so yeah well we had some innovations

325
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,078
that's that's correct

326
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,879
uh

327
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:51,199
it uh it is strange but uh rolling

328
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,519
papers with tips are not so old think

329
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,160
you know some people still they still

330
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,959
come and don't know what this is and are

331
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,958
amazed and

332
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,519
not not so this is not so old and we had

333
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,639
quite a good success with some of our

334
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,480
models

335
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,278
so making

336
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,879
well

337
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,439
if you are a company you always have to

338
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:15,838
do something new so either this is

339
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,680
either is it it is a new design or

340
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,000
either it is a new model

341
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,838
or it has to be something new so you

342
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,039
have to develop

343
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,399
during the

344
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:28,799
your existence to to be successful

345
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,320
thank you very much that's logical uh

346
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:34,479
petra

347
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:37,040
your product range is quite big yeah

348
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,120
you told me you're not allowed to

349
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:41,278
publish on facebook to do marketing on

350
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,000
facebook slovenia is quite a small

351
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:46,240
country so you also are depend you

352
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,519
depend on the export so is there

353
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,320
anything but print advertisement

354
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,720
that

355
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,639
can be successful for you and if how

356
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,480
successful successful can print

357
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,799
advertisement be

358
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,278
well um print

359
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:04,479
advertising i think it went down with

360
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:07,198
social media and everything

361
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,600
we try to do different ways

362
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:12,000
still want to stay legal because it's

363
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,240
really important for us to stay on the

364
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,440
track that's allowed

365
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,480
that was that is also our priority

366
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,680
um

367
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,839
but we for example we did a

368
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,559
knobby cbd shop in the center of

369
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:29,120
ljubljana um

370
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,479
also for marketing reasons

371
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,440
because

372
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,240
if i go and

373
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,720
book a banner somewhere on the

374
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,519
i don't know i don't know where

375
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,399
it costs really a lot of money so if we

376
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,278
have a shop which is stable and still

377
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,278
there and people go by there every day

378
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,360
we have it in a really good

379
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:53,278
central district kind of a small

380
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,360
flagship store yeah it's a flagship

381
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:57,278
store so they they see the brand they

382
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,759
see they go there

383
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:01,519
by that every day and i think this is

384
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,000
one of the ways to

385
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,440
to go there and people come in and

386
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,120
we had a

387
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,920
really good results

388
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,360
before corona with the cbd shop that

389
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,759
that's one of the

390
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,120
ways to go to the

391
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,838
customers

392
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,078
of course it's a really a hard time to

393
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,320
to do it with

394
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:24,799
exporting with

395
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,760
corona and quarantine and staying at

396
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,719
home

397
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,360
but

398
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,000
we we try to

399
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,240
be on this kind of events to

400
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,120
let the world see what we have so that's

401
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,240
one of the ways to do the marketing so

402
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,159
yeah um this question goes actually out

403
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,639
to all three panelists and anybody who

404
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:47,679
wants to answer can decide how important

405
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,759
is your own homepage

406
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:52,479
sorry your own url how important is your

407
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,800
own homepage for marketing homepage

408
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,480
webpage yeah webpage

409
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,479
i think it is very important

410
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,040
because people go there to find

411
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,040
information

412
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,599
and we we put

413
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,639
really strict information we learned

414
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,639
from

415
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,440
we were doing it this for three years

416
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,519
but we've learned a lot and we

417
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,959
are really selective what we put on our

418
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,959
web page

419
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:22,799
to get them see what we have so it's

420
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,879
hard with

421
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:27,599
cbd and everything and

422
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,679
all the restrictions but still people

423
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,759
can get all the information there so i

424
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,958
think that's really important to

425
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,039
to

426
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,159
do really nice

427
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,639
webpage

428
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:40,480
have an information there for them to to

429
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,399
see and to look up for you yeah i'd

430
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,480
agree on that it's a complete social

431
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,159
media profile you know it's everything

432
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,320
is

433
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,559
approach that you have it dif it may

434
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,879
differ from one to another

435
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,159
specifically i probably think that we

436
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,039
are in a different

437
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:59,360
branches but

438
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,838
approach that you choose has to be

439
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,038
different because there's so many things

440
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,640
on online that you need something to

441
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,798
stand out

442
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,400
mike you don't have a like physical

443
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:13,439
store you concentrate on online

444
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,480
marketing our online focus is online

445
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:20,079
and uh when we talked before the panel

446
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,318
you told me you have like a very special

447
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:25,198
strategy and uh

448
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,798
you're connecting cbd and sports tell us

449
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,640
about that uh well i'm actually an

450
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:30,319
athlete myself

451
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,320
i'm currently number six in the world

452
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:33,839
for a sport called wake skating it's

453
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:35,519
it's very similar to wake boarding but

454
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:36,959
you're not strapped into the board so

455
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:38,798
you can spin the board underneath you

456
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,400
and flip it around when you're riding on

457
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:41,519
top of the water

458
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,840
and i was a

459
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,319
big skateboarder for a long time and so

460
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:49,359
i was explaining this to someone else at

461
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:52,000
this conference earlier and they said oh

462
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:54,000
so you're like the red bull of cbd is

463
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
kind of how i put it and it

464
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,839
it's cheesy but i think it is kind of a

465
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,359
good description of what we're doing i

466
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,439
have

467
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,759
i decided to start sponsoring athletes

468
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,279
because like i mentioned earlier oh no

469
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:07,679
that was with you guys but cbd wasn't

470
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:10,240
really my passion kind of thc was my

471
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,798
passion but like trying to get into the

472
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,519
legal part is when i was able to do more

473
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:17,359
with cbd because i can do that legally

474
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,359
so i decided to sponsor a bunch of

475
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:21,199
athletes who are professionals all

476
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:24,079
across the spectrum

477
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,279
from surfing skateboarding wakeboarding

478
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:29,759
of course

479
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:30,798
snowboarding bmx motocross

480
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,000
some of these people rode in the

481
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:33,119
olympics

482
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,359
and

483
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,639
and so it's

484
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,558
there's other companies that might have

485
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,759
sponsored four or five people but we

486
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,678
really have 35 different athletes and

487
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:46,480
mainly i focused with sponsoring some of

488
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,720
the best writers in europe because since

489
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,480
i'm located here now that's kind of

490
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,079
where my focus is i do business to

491
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,558
customer and not business to business so

492
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:59,119
when i did this it was really kind of um

493
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:01,119
it really helped to expand because it's

494
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,879
kind of like i have a bunch of mini

495
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,199
influencers if you will

496
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,360
underneath me promoting for my brand

497
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,240
because um i actually

498
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:12,479
focus on instagram mainly by launching

499
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,480
og labs i focus mainly by doing

500
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,798
instagram stuff so i have a bunch of

501
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,240
athletes on there who share posts about

502
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:19,440
when they get products or when they're

503
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,519
using them

504
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,080
how it helps them recover from training

505
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:26,558
or sports injuries

506
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,159
and so they each spread the message and

507
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:30,319
they have a lot of people following them

508
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,880
so it's been a really successful kind of

509
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:34,720
strategy that you know i didn't do it

510
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,640
really for the business purposes as much

511
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,960
as i want to really support other

512
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,480
writers because

513
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,600
there's tremendous benefits that can be

514
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,200
found by using cannabis for athletes so

515
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,159
it was kind of a nice thing that

516
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,240
developed that i also helped my business

517
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,679
grow by doing this well let me please

518
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,679
ask you an additional question because

519
00:19:53,679 --> 00:20:00,400
you're from the u.s and i think in the

520
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:02,720
us this strategy is already quite common

521
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,200
it's well known would you say it's

522
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,440
already this kind of strategy is

523
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,880
widespread in europe already or are you

524
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,360
kind of is it so far kind of unique

525
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,520
it's it's unique for europe i was

526
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:17,678
fortunate to be positioned to at the

527
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,679
time i was to be able to

528
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:23,200
get so many writers because there isn't

529
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,960
other companies doing this um

530
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,679
in the us there is companies like you

531
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,440
said

532
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,120
but they really only do like six or

533
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,200
eight athletes you know there's there's

534
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:34,399
not and to me it's kind of like oh we

535
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,919
just got these guys you know because

536
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,880
to show that our company's good they're

537
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,159
not really out to support athletes

538
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,240
so

539
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,919
i think that's kind of why i've gotten

540
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,319
so many athletes and so many athletes

541
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,320
have gravitated towards working with us

542
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:51,119
is because they realize hey i'm a writer

543
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:52,879
too he wants to hook up people you know

544
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:56,319
our prices are affordable for for

545
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,240
athletes to purchase you know so

546
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:00,319
i don't know you have to be authentic

547
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,200
yeah and that's that's what i guess i do

548
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:05,119
is less marketing and just kind of like

549
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,720
being who i am and who we are and i'm

550
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:10,158
the company i don't have employees so

551
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,240
like og labs is this me so

552
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,440
jury you're doing kind of a different

553
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,159
approach

554
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,120
you also do a lot you do a lot of white

555
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,440
label products or snail does a lot of

556
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:25,359
white labeling um

557
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:28,798
in how far can this help uh in a in in

558
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:32,000
in a special branch where you

559
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:34,720
are really uh you cannot advertise free

560
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,480
freely like in your brush you cannot

561
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,360
like do free marketing because it's all

562
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,640
limited uh how is uh what does white

563
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:42,879
labeling uh

564
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,080
what tell me about the advantages of

565
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,000
white labeling products

566
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:51,038
well we do

567
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,440
more or less only white labeling so what

568
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:55,519
our brand is

569
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,519
the products the final products of our

570
00:21:55,519 --> 00:22:02,240
brand this is very small portion of it

571
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:03,839
so 95 of our businesses white labeling

572
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,480
and

573
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,720
we will do all kinds of stuff you know

574
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,880
as i explained the promotion of business

575
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,759
to business it's not so easy as business

576
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,760
to see because you don't have a such a

577
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:18,158
big palette of media

578
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:20,079
so before you mentioned a web page web

579
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,159
page of course has to be

580
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,038
very well built because you need to

581
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,039
build the

582
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:28,558
confidence with your client because you

583
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:28,558
have a shitty web page you know

584
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,480
they say this is not a good company

585
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:37,038
we cannot use

586
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:39,520
we were using because a lot of

587
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,279
magazines emerged in a certain period

588
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:44,240
you had one as well

589
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:46,798
and the printed advertising was very

590
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,200
popular and because we are rolling

591
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:51,279
papers and rolling papers and magazines

592
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:56,400
go kind of together you know we were

593
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:56,399
doing rolling papers for magazines and

594
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,880
and we get got an ad in them in them but

595
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,919
when we

596
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,840
checked

597
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:10,559
what what the result of the ad

598
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:13,519
was basically it was very bad you know i

599
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:15,038
i read a statistic once

600
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,720
this is from

601
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:19,200
another type of marketing i read the

602
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,600
statistic that there is a

603
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,400
twice bigger possibility that you got to

604
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,359
get hit by lightning then click a banner

605
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,120
ad

606
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,479
so

607
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:30,719
you know what the nice thing is about

608
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,599
marketing today in my eyes in former

609
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,159
days it was like henry ford said you

610
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,918
always waste 50 of your marketing budget

611
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,840
you never know but you never know which

612
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,799
fifty percent you wasted

613
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,959
today you can at least you at least know

614
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:46,879
if you're a little smart uh

615
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,798
which fifty percent you wasted because

616
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,600
you can track it

617
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:53,599
today and now comes my next next

618
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,918
question uh you mentioned about you

619
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:59,038
mentioned b2b that's a totally different

620
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:02,080
marketing strategy in a b2b business and

621
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:04,640
you also do b2b so how does your

622
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:06,798
marketing strategy differ

623
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,320
when it comes to b2b from your b2c

624
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:10,720
strategy

625
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:13,200
it's a completely different thing

626
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,640
with b2c you have to be

627
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,240
it's really important how you look on

628
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,000
the shelf how

629
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,720
how the customer

630
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,839
if you sell online what's the packaging

631
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,798
unpacking this experience is important

632
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:29,278
uh if you sell on i don't know grocery

633
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:32,079
store it's important where you're placed

634
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:34,079
on the shelf and stuff like that if you

635
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:36,158
do business to business marketing it's

636
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:38,480
pretty much different because you need

637
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,760
to persuade

638
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,400
somehow

639
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,599
the business partner that you differ

640
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,798
from

641
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:48,730
others and we choose the approach that

642
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:51,200
we offer them complete

643
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:53,679
[Music]

644
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,360
every every step of the the ways

645
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,440
complete service complete service yeah

646
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:59,278
thank you for for helping

647
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,000
um so

648
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:03,919
usually in cannabis business in

649
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,759
europe we see

650
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,400
really similar products in different

651
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:10,640
packaging that that's one way to do

652
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,720
private labeling and everything but we

653
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:16,240
choose the approach to offer our

654
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,759
customers business b2b customers also

655
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,679
the

656
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,599
different packaging and

657
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,759
options you know it's i think it's

658
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:26,319
really important that someone

659
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,960
stands out in his own way not only to

660
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:30,319
stand out with his logo and

661
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,400
have a

662
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:35,439
green leaf and

663
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,440
something on it

664
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:41,278
it's important that

665
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:44,000
you it's important to stand out in a way

666
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:46,640
that you get noticed and

667
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,119
you can get noticed with great packaging

668
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,278
you can get noticed with great design

669
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:54,239
and we start

670
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:55,679
we we try to offer that to the

671
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,278
other companies

672
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,679
because we didn't see that on the market

673
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:00,880
so you kind of also consult your b2b

674
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,200
customers

675
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,278
and help them labeling how to develop

676
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,200
and but you also if you're not if you

677
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:11,839
don't agree you also let the customer do

678
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,840
his own stuff for sure yeah

679
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,798
my next question uh question goes out to

680
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,278
mike um

681
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:21,359
you're not doing so much b2b business i

682
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:24,240
think you're

683
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:26,879
but you're selling internationally yes

684
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,319
so um what about regulations because i

685
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,520
know you're doing business all over the

686
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,759
world and

687
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,359
in for in many different countries and

688
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,200
don't you have any problems with the

689
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,959
different national regulations it's

690
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,919
pretty funny you mentioned that actually

691
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,079
um i i do want to go into b2b this year

692
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:45,759
maybe um

693
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:47,439
so we'll we'll look at that but um

694
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:49,519
but the reason

695
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,600
that i started doing international and

696
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,519
really why

697
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,278
why i made og labs and everything was

698
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:58,158
because i'm in it for the patients and

699
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:59,200
i'm a cannabis patient and so i learned

700
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,679
about

701
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,038
how great of medical benefits come with

702
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,600
making some really high potent thc oil

703
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:09,278
for myself i had crohn's disease and so

704
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:11,199
after i took a certain amount of this

705
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:14,319
oil i don't suffer from the symptoms

706
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,080
anymore and so i told this on my social

707
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:18,398
media and then this is where it kind of

708
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:20,158
spread like wildfire everyone was

709
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:22,719
messaging me saying hey i need oil for

710
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,840
my mom or my daughter or my sister or my

711
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,360
cousin

712
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:27,678
they're dying they have two weeks to

713
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:29,278
live the doctor gave up on them there's

714
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,720
nothing else he can do

715
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:34,960
he said go home and die well this was in

716
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,919
2014 and these people are still alive

717
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,640
today

718
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,759
so

719
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,679
um

720
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,599
that was kind of

721
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,000
what fueled international shipping for

722
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:46,000
me and i try to do it as much as i can

723
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,880
with some of my products that aren't

724
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,759
high thc oil but like the high thco goes

725
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,840
to every country no matter what for the

726
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:56,558
for the sole reason the only reason is

727
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:59,119
because i get a message and someone says

728
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:01,759
i'm dying and can you help me

729
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:05,599
and so this kind of being the person i

730
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:07,519
am i cannot tell this person no so even

731
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:08,480
if they're in some extreme

732
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,319
place

733
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,319
you know in asia or something where the

734
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,798
laws are extremely harsh

735
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:16,558
i still do everything i can to

736
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:18,720
package the product discreetly or in a

737
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:20,720
way where it can get to them so that

738
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,399
they can actually use it and recover

739
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,360
from some of these serious diseases that

740
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:28,239
the doctors can't help them with

741
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:30,558
and so i it's it's a little bit harder

742
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,000
with the cbd stuff because of the

743
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:33,839
labeling and the packaging and the

744
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,240
design it's it's not easy to make that

745
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:38,000
discreet so some of these products i

746
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,159
don't ship internationally

747
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,798
i want to but they just get stopped by

748
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,200
customs and this has happened you tried

749
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:47,278
it's happened before and no one's gotten

750
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,159
in trouble but customs does stop the

751
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:50,159
package or take it

752
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:53,389
did they sue you for anything like that

753
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,079
so far not yet

754
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:57,200
[Laughter]

755
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:59,759
so my

756
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,038
i think we are close to the end but i

757
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:02,960
want to

758
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:05,200
one i want to know one thing from yuri

759
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,519
still because when you came into the

760
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,440
market uh slovenia is not a traditional

761
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:11,359
rolling papers country for especially

762
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,840
not for king size then we had other

763
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:15,038
players in spain and in france which

764
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:17,359
were

765
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:19,278
a long time before

766
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:21,439
your company on the market but your

767
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:23,919
company i see it in every grow shop i

768
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,720
see it on every uh in every cigarette

769
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,200
shop

770
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,640
so yeah you made a good job how did you

771
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,159
manage to

772
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,640
uh

773
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:36,399
fight not fight but uh to to to to be a

774
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,559
competitor for those big

775
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:41,359
paper companies

776
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:44,319
it may sound funny but we attended all

777
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:44,319
the cannabis shows

778
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,600
um

779
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:50,158
well this industry changed a lot you

780
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:52,079
know from four big players

781
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,600
i will not mention them

782
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:55,038
um

783
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,839
in the past there were only four big

784
00:29:55,038 --> 00:30:00,158
players producing rolling papers uh

785
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:03,038
you could get a lighter printed

786
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,278
in every bar or everywhere meanwhile you

787
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:06,480
could not get a print rolling paper with

788
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:08,798
the label

789
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,079
when we started we want to

790
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:11,918
when we didn't have such big

791
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,480
possibilities of production we want to

792
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:18,559
make a private label with one of the big

793
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,640
companies and the moq was 300 000

794
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:22,480
one the big companies when they use the

795
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,640
machine they melt it

796
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,880
so nobody else could use it so the

797
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,200
machines were not for sale because they

798
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,640
were destroyed after usage

799
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,360
and

800
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,520
15 years something like that

801
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,479
companies which were producing machinery

802
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:38,960
emerged

803
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,839
and it was possible to buy a

804
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,360
automatic packing machine

805
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:46,398
which

806
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:48,719
then caused this industry to spread

807
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:50,959
and i think also

808
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,440
there is a

809
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:57,038
cultural movement maybe that

810
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,919
company wants companies and even

811
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:00,960
people

812
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,080
want to personalize things so it's a

813
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,000
it's a

814
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:06,558
current state of mind that you want to

815
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,880
personalize you want to have your own

816
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:08,879
and

817
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,679
so one thing is that we were

818
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:18,079
company rolling paper company which was

819
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,919
oriented towards a cannabis smoker

820
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:22,000
because traditional

821
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,759
rolling paper companies are not oriented

822
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,079
towards cannabis smoker they are

823
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:28,640
actually ashamed if someone would be

824
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:29,759
connecting them with cannabis

825
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,640
and

826
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:33,759
the second thing is that uh

827
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,679
the

828
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:37,519
the this difference in people's heads

829
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:42,240
and the possibility that they could make

830
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:43,038
it caused this uh this uh growth of

831
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,399
of

832
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:46,879
our business

833
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:49,119
yeah you really did an amazing job for a

834
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,440
company that was quite new in the market

835
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:53,518
within the last 15 years

836
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,360
well just to comment your uh thing about

837
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,480
slovenia not being a rolling paper

838
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:58,398
country

839
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,798
we have

840
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:03,119
we have two producers in slovenia

841
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:04,398
meanwhile we are bordering with italy

842
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,759
hungary

843
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:09,038
austria croatia which none of them has

844
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,200
uh

845
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:13,440
producers of private labor rolling

846
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,278
papers i think germany doesn't have it

847
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,480
france doesn't have it

848
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:18,558
so

849
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,960
and we have two so

850
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:23,200
we are a rolling paper country

851
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,000
and as you mentioned in the beginning we

852
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,640
never talked about the panel is

853
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,200
finished soon but during the whole panel

854
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,159
we never talked about the marketing tool

855
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,399
cannabis shows and cannabis congresses

856
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:39,679
and we also should not forget about that

857
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:41,518
even especially here b2b people this is

858
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,480
i think for everybody for anybody who's

859
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,319
here uh cannabis shows and cannabis uh

860
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,960
congresses are one of the greatest

861
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:51,200
opportunities for b2c and for b2b to

862
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,038
business wouldn't you agree

863
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,840
that's my last question to our panelists

864
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:57,599
and i think this is the best way to to

865
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:59,119
stand out to show

866
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:00,000
and to be

867
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:01,839
seen

868
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,640
and

869
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:07,199
if people see you they they can see what

870
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,480
you have so if you you do your other

871
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,399
marketing well then you stand out and i

872
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,278
think that's the main thing everybody

873
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:16,079
wants and the personalization that yuri

874
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:18,079
said

875
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,759
i think this is the key

876
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:22,158
ingredient to go

877
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:23,679
in future marketing and i think we all

878
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,240
experienced

879
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:29,600
how bad it is if you can't meet in the

880
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:33,038
last 18 months yeah we we did 15 expos

881
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:34,719

882
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:36,839

883
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,278
