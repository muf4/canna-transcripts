00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:32,159
clint

14
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:37,049
[Music]

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,439
clint's still missing clint is still

16
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,878
missing do we wait

17
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,079
do we start

18
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:45,359
i think we should start we should have a

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,600
conversation

20
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,600
is everyone enjoying barcelona this is

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,960
my first time here isn't this awesome to

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,719
be back yes clap yes can we hear a round

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,120
of applause for the awesome team that

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,079
pulled this off icbc rocks right okay

25
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,599
good so um i'm also hoping that we're

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,600
going to wake all of you up because it's

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,760
been a long awesome day of networking

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,719
and whatever but i want to have your

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,960
input so i think somebody's got a mic on

30
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,679
the bottom but if not just get up and be

31
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:17,280
loud the idea is is we're gonna have a

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,080
discussion about supply chain strategies

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,159
that could drive legalization right and

34
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,920
we want to be really creative about this

35
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,280
in an environment in europe for those of

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,400
you who don't know

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,280
where

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,079
a case called the the can of vape case

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,599
in france actually drove a decision

40
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,239
about cbd

41
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,399
on an eu level and actually picking up

42
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,319
for the excellent panel that we just had

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,960
with with everybody um before the last

44
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,719
speaker that's actually i think

45
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,640
the suing discussion

46
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,759
and the import export discussion is one

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,960
of the best ways that i would say legacy

48
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,399
cannabis and and i would say maybe

49
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,798
cultural cannabis

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,718
can have an impact on the corporate side

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,159
because if your case is in the news and

52
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,798
you sue and you win

53
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,280
you know that's a pretty big impact on

54
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,080
you know corporate cannabis from an

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,479
import export perspective regardless as

56
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,319
a result of that situation

57
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,920
obviously one of the issues in the in

58
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,159
the market right now is when you import

59
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,000
and export across borders there are a

60
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,000
couple of very interesting conversations

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,840
that open up both whether what you're

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,239
allowed to do from a legalization

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,280
perspective like cbd across borders and

64
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,599
then eventually thc and maybe even niche

65
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,598
markets so what i'd like to do actually

66
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:34,799
is open this up with the first question

67
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:36,479
about this what is your feeling about

68
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,480
as i would say the strategy of sue the

69
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,000
bastards as you're importing and

70
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,719
exporting even if you have to defend

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,280
yourself is that an interesting way do

72
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:48,000
you think to drive markets as well as

73
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,000
legalization

74
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,680
um i'll be happy to go first

75
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:56,159
sue the bastards is not really the

76
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,000
european strategy on many things we like

77
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,639
to align ourselves with certain

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,759
standards and certain existing uh

79
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:06,000
structures and try to find a smooth way

80
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,399
in and if [ __ ] hits the fan you can

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,878
still you know protect yourself and and

82
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,560
sue if that has if that is an option but

83
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:15,199
in the end of the day i believe to be

84
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,400
able to open this industry be it on the

85
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:20,639
cbd the thc or in any other

86
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,920
part of the industry we should really

87
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,598
try to find existing standards existing

88
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,878
products that are aligned with those

89
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:30,959
products and then find a way around that

90
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,798
and then really align yourself with that

91
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,479
because in the end of the day

92
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,640
suing is

93
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,959
it's another strategy so maybe not the

94
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,238
first one to go with but

95
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,400
keep your interests

96
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,319
in line and protect yourself yes is kai

97
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,760
in the audience for those who don't know

98
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,439
there's a lawyer who is suing the

99
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,359
government over the hemp question maybe

100
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,039
he would disagree but regardless so what

101
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,879
do you think about that

102
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,120
so

103
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:58,318
my first reaction is that if i look at

104
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,200
the canadian market the whole cannabis

105
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:03,199
act in canada started from the suing

106
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,598
people suing the government to allow

107
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,438
them access to medication

108
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,039
so yes i mean

109
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:13,359
the thing is the

110
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:15,519
that i think that the cannabis market in

111
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,439
in europe in general basically not only

112
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,639
in europe around the world this is what

113
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,879
i called

114
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,240
swiss cheese because it's more horse

115
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,360
than cheese

116
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,280
and

117
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,720
there's no

118
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:30,559
certain body of regulation

119
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,080
certainly not about uh

120
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,199
moving product from one country to

121
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,918
another

122
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,040
that

123
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,719
that organize it so you can see like if

124
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,879
you're going back to your first

125
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,040
suggestion of suing the buses you can

126
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,519
sue the german government but it won't

127
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,840
change anything about holland denmark or

128
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,879
or lincoln change so

129
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:50,159
um

130
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,159
i've got a question for you though but

131
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,400
what about then if let's say you sue and

132
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,560
lose and then you appeal i mean that's

133
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,079
you appeal to the eu level right because

134
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,759
that's really where you want to go but

135
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,879
you have to sue at a country level first

136
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,919
well again i i agree that swing i mean

137
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,319
the the

138
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:08,560
major thing that suing will will give

139
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,959
you is coverage in the news and

140
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,720
basically bringing that the cannabis

141
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,038
into the main

142
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,680
[Music]

143
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,759
conversation so people will talk about

144
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,600
the notification people will talk about

145
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,600
in radio show talk show etc so you will

146
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,000
have some kind of audience that are

147
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,840
basically going behind it

148
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,879
but

149
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,959
i think

150
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,439
the

151
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,879
the point of suing is that you have to

152
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,439
have an issue

153
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,399
i cannot sue the government because i

154
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,800
want

155
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,719
i can sue the government if i want as a

156
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,840
person something that the government

157
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,080
doesn't allow me but i cannot sue

158
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,478
the government based on

159
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,478
imaginary crowd

160
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,000
so that's right but put to your point

161
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,079
about this i mean the whole point about

162
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,439
this is it is swiss cheese and the

163
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,199
people who found themselves in those

164
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,959
lawsuit situations

165
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,800
did not do it on purpose right they

166
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,758
ended up thinking that they could and

167
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,600
then they

168
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,038
got caught and then sued and then that's

169
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,360
how they won

170
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:10,879
right so so my question is has anyone

171
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,479
have you guys ever been involved in that

172
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,478
kind of lawsuit or

173
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,439
personally not but like i said i mean

174
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:19,199
the whole system in canada was based on

175
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,120
people suing the government for one

176
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,280
thing then the government

177
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,319
obviously lost the case they had to

178
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,159
change some kind of regulation

179
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,360
then people found you know they were

180
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,000
allowed smoking people someone smoke

181
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,800
sued the government how can you force my

182
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,199
seven years old child to smoke

183
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,520
and obviously you want the case so

184
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,960
that's how the government initially

185
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,399
eventually kind of allow oil etc so

186
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,439
there is uh

187
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:52,959
you have to have a private standing that

188
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:54,560
my case has to find a solution um

189
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,799
obviously i don't know if you remember

190
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,759
there was a couple of months ago

191
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,319
a lady that came back to england with a

192
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,080
with a with a child she flew to america

193
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,520
to give her child

194
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,478
cbd

195
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,758
she was arrested as she landed in the

196
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,639
in heathrow

197
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,240
and the child was given to some kind of

198
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,360
social security

199
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,680
uh social services and

200
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,319
immediately it went to the press and

201
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,240
within seven days they changed the law

202
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,479
in england so that's that's another kind

203
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,478
of import export strategy that it's

204
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,680
probably a little bit more risky right

205
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:31,519
the personal one as opposed to the

206
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,280
corporate one let's move on to the the

207
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,519
next issue which is we were discussing

208
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,519
this back in the green room um one other

209
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,439
thing the impacts of the

210
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,198
uh development of the medical market in

211
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,240
germany what that has done is it's

212
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,400
driven

213
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,400
feeder markets all the way around europe

214
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,839
in fact all over the world right now who

215
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,959
are trying to get medical product into

216
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,119
germany

217
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:54,239
right and that has driven reform in

218
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,720
places like colombia or south africa

219
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,038
we're sitting at the end here and like

220
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,479
how do you think that

221
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,560
why do you think for example it's

222
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,000
important for the industry i think to be

223
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,598
aware certainly it's not something you

224
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,038
can stretch out of your

225
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,038
realm to do but if you're in the way of

226
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,759
it i mean those are really important

227
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,199
finding you know i would say important

228
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,439
trigger markets

229
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,960
to see reform and will drive reform in

230
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,120
other places and obviously that's

231
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:23,598
involved in the import export discussion

232
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,598
canada germany or etc what do you think

233
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,318
i'd like to actually take one step back

234
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,240
to the question before about sewing or

235
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,000
not sewing and because just one little

236
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,918
thing that maybe the swiss cheese is

237
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,240
what triggered it there a bit i am from

238
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,399
switzerland what we've done the industry

239
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,080
association has to put has put together

240
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,519
a paper where we analyzed all the

241
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,800
different standards that are out there

242
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,480
and we put them in perspective to

243
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,479
categories and then medical cannabis and

244
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,959
what's coming with recreational and we

245
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,680
made a bottom-up forward motion not a

246
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:53,359
suing counter-reactive approach by the

247
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,199
bottom-up approach that kind of brings

248
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,759
the industry forward and allows

249
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,080
consensus and based on that then create

250
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,919
standards that we can work with between

251
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,920
the different countries and the import

252
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,559
export regulation in

253
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:08,479
anything that has to do with eu gmp i

254
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,399
always say it's the easiest

255
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,399
way to do things because it's already

256
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,360
been defined it's already been done it's

257
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,278
been a proven concept the laws are there

258
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,360
the different regulations the exchange

259
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,039
between the countries is there

260
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,800
it's of course the hardest to get it

261
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:24,240
meets the most different stages of your

262
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,759
compliance and it's the most different

263
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,759
stages reproduction

264
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,519
control over every single aspect of your

265
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,120
operation but in the end of the day at

266
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,120
least it's defined

267
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,519
and i think a big thing that is missing

268
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,080
at the moment is that the definition of

269
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,240
what needs to be done in compliance or

270
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,320
standardization if you want to go

271
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,159
away now medical is clear medical is

272
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,640
clear medical has been done that's the

273
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,639
open trade route at the moment

274
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,879
but what happens with recreational do we

275
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:54,319
go tobacco laws do we go

276
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:56,958
narcotic laws do we go full uh

277
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,120
eugmp so i think that's the more

278
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:01,119
interesting part right now to see other

279
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,639
policy making and then opening different

280
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,639
trade routes is

281
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,720
how do we do how do we define these

282
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,720
different products and how do we build a

283
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,879
harmonized system between the different

284
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,040
countries about that and learn from what

285
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,240
the us has been doing or what have they

286
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:15,679
i believe they've been doing wrong with

287
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,039
that no choice right it's federally

288
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,039
illegal you cannot move it from one

289
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,039
state to the other it's our choice it's

290
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,759
our chance in europe right now to kind

291
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,120
of

292
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,240
learn from that

293
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,480
but we have to find a regulatory uh not

294
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,759
another regulator

295
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,039
and that's the issue it's like how do

296
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,278
you find that

297
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,879
and how do you define that in a way that

298
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:37,039
everyone agrees with you i'm sure there

299
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,679
are lots of opinions here about whether

300
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:42,559
gacp or gmp is going to lead the

301
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:44,239
recreational discussion across borders

302
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,119
even in germany they're not going to i

303
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,399
mean they're not going to grow

304
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,759
everything that germans are going to

305
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,559
consume right so where's that going to

306
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,958
come from well in a way i agree with

307
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:55,199
with what luke said i mean definitely

308
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,479
definitely this the lack of regulation

309
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,000
across

310
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,720
europe is is one one object object to to

311
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,559
look at it or a

312
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,600
hurdle that we have to cross

313
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,799
but uh

314
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,920
you know

315
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,559
in a way

316
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,799
if we for example i know like we said

317
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:16,239
before holland have

318
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:18,559
tried to come

319
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,879
the cannabis that will end up in the in

320
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:25,518
the coffee shop in holland will end up

321
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:28,639
to be gcp compliance so if you comply

322
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,560
with your product and you convince the

323
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,480
authorities or the government itself

324
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,000
showing them convince them that the

325
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,278
product is good

326
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,360
then obviously the demand will

327
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:42,240
will drive the market i think the

328
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,120
another point of view that we can have

329
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,000
we can

330
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,399
talk about definitely uh is is the

331
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,360
veterinarian product we know that there

332
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:55,039
is 60 million cats in europe hong kong

333
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,839
as a pets no not as a stray cats

334
00:11:55,039 --> 00:12:00,240
so it's a huge market a veterinary

335
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,800
product for pets so if it's cbd is good

336
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,120
for dogs or cbd is good for whatever the

337
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,879
the code of the of the cats

338
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,720
the demand will

339
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:12,879
will create some kind of of

340
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,759
allowance in the in the law rather than

341
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:17,278
through them so this is basically my

342
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,078
approach is

343
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,879
to convince consumers that that product

344
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:23,359
is

345
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,720
meet some basic standards

346
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,159
that it's safe

347
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,680
but it's

348
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,319
controlled

349
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:32,399
and therefore it should be legalized

350
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,959
but it's and this is sort of intertwined

351
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,600
right so let's say the german market

352
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:40,000
wakes up to the beauties of

353
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,440
cbd pet food right and people try to buy

354
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,039
it they try to buy it on amazon and

355
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,040
there's nothing in germany so they buy

356
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,759
it from holland and then that package

357
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,439
crosses the border and someone gets

358
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,679
caught because the germans still have

359
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,000
not decided what cbd is that's the

360
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,519
lawsuit thing right but to your point i

361
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,679
think what you're suggesting is maybe

362
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,440
the development of niche markets

363
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,759
could also drive

364
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,440
i guess consumer demand

365
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,120
but then in that environment

366
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,760
particularly in the in the situation

367
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,399
where we just referenced there is no

368
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:12,319
standard yet on a european level

369
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,159
welcome to lawsuit city again right

370
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,480
somebody is going to get sued or a firm

371
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,000
is going to get sued that's why this is

372
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,600
coming up again but let's move beyond

373
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,278
that and that's why i wanted to get on

374
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,560
to the idea of

375
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:27,200
what do you guys think is going to be

376
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:28,879
the first kind of regulated cannabis to

377
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,200
cross borders

378
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:35,120
you know in the re in the in the in the

379
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:40,560
recreational side is it going to be gacp

380
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:43,039
thc or eu gmp thc what do you guys think

381
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,078
personally like i said if if i look at

382
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,000
my

383
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,879
involvement with with a project in

384
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,879
holland it will be gacp

385
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:56,000
eu because gazp is is a standard that is

386
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,838
recognized by the ema ema or european

387
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
medicinal agency

388
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,519
and it's acceptable all across europe

389
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,278
obviously in germany as well so

390
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,278
again if you've got the narcotic

391
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,039
questions you brought up before right i

392
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,439
mean is it a narcotic is it not a

393
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,639
narcotic certainly on the thc side

394
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,199
you're going to be running into what

395
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,959
exactly is that as long as it's

396
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:18,958
defined or as long as that is the same

397
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:21,278
level in the u.n as it has right now it

398
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,198
will be it's a narcotic there's no way

399
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:25,439
around it so it's it's classified as a

400
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:27,599
narcotic um in switzerland we have the

401
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,760
pilot project which is like

402
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,000
you know a swiss white or a nationwide

403
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,000
study on how a legalization could go

404
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,278
forward and there's a very clear

405
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,159
regulatory part where this is the actual

406
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:42,078
narcotics parts that you need to report

407
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,159
and then on the bottom up approach you

408
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:46,479
have the gacp that you need to actually

409
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:48,480
comply with then switzerland threw in

410
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,879
there some you have to do it organic so

411
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,278
it has to be grown outside or at least

412
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,198
in the ground so we have added a few

413
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:57,439
different layers of

414
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,759
making sure that the industry

415
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,839
stays stays uh local in that in the

416
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,439
beginning and it's not being imported

417
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,839
that's the next point that was one of

418
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,839
the things

419
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:10,958
as long as it's in the in the regulatory

420
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,198
framework it is right now the import and

421
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,799
export is a very difficult thing right

422
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:16,240
you have to sing that conventionally you

423
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:17,519
have to make those different agreements

424
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,198
between the countries that means that

425
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,440
both countries need to have the same

426
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:24,879
agreements on how they declare it the

427
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,600
idea idea so all of that

428
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,679
once we actually agree it's a plant

429
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,000
if you want to transform a plant into a

430
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:35,039
medicinal product you follow the gacp

431
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,120
guidelines so that is set that has been

432
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,198
that has been done for many many years

433
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,879
you know a lot of smart people came up

434
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:42,958
with this and you have that as a

435
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:45,120
standard right and then you go what is

436
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,198
the end product that you want to make

437
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,120
and then you see where it takes you be

438
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:51,278
it in a consumer product be it in a

439
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,039
medical product and then you follow that

440
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,759
and for me i think the most important

441
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,120
thing is we should stop all trying to do

442
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,959
our own thing

443
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,399
and really see like okay this has been

444
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,479
done in food

445
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,399
this has been done in tobacco this has

446
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,360
been done in medical in the medical

447
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,759
industry

448
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,440
and and not just tried to wiggle our way

449
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,120
through okay now i declare it on this

450
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,639
side as this and i import it as that and

451
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,320
then i distribute it at that and then in

452
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,240
the end i complained that i get sued or

453
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,480
that i go to jail for it like yeah you

454
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,079
just you just wiggled your way around it

455
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,320
but you didn't find a clear straight

456
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:24,879
line and we have to define that straight

457
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,040
line and then approach the regulator and

458
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,439
the and set standards but you bring up a

459
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:31,278
very very key point about strategy in

460
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,519
the cannabis market generally a lot of

461
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:37,120
success is also made by finding that

462
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:40,000
loophole initially sometimes i i'm not

463
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,839
disagreeing with you at all right but

464
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,480
but for example you know how do you

465
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,279
bring in a plant as a pharmaceutical

466
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,120
product or an api i mean there's lots of

467
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:51,679
there's lots of i would say loopholes

468
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,320
that exist again because of the lack of

469
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,559
regulatory standard across the eu which

470
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,959
gets to i guess the uber point here

471
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:01,119
which is certainly within the context of

472
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,758
the eu and switzerland

473
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,439
you know what do you see as the trends

474
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,519
for xm

475
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,640
going forward as

476
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:12,639
as policies change and vice versa do you

477
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,720
think that for example i mean the

478
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,959
example i gave before germany changed

479
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,798
its medical law and all of a sudden you

480
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,400
have a ring of markets trying to get

481
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:21,838
their product into germany which is

482
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,360
driven reform

483
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:27,119
do you see that as a pattern going

484
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,119
forward or not and why

485
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,519
um i guess when whenever a market opens

486
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,759
right there is a lot of people that want

487
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:36,240
to want to get get access to it one way

488
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,599
or the other and then we see a lot of

489
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,279
different approaches and a lot of

490
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,519
different ways of bringing the product

491
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:44,480
to germany or bringing the product via x

492
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,079
to z and then bringing it to germany and

493
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,000
there is yeah as you said you can wiggle

494
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,000
your way and there is loopholes at the

495
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,240
end of the day as long as we build an

496
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,679
industry based on wiggling and loopholes

497
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,400
we don't have an economically

498
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,640
sustainable business structure behind it

499
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,240
that will not allow other

500
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,919
large it's not even about corporate

501
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,240
entities right it's just about

502
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,320
supporting uh business structures that

503
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,558
we need to actually grow and bring this

504
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:11,119
to a further level so as long as we try

505
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:13,279
to find those ways around it will be

506
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:16,479
really hard to actually

507
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:18,319
create a real a real industry right so

508
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,160
so yes those ways are there and as long

509
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,480
as there's opportunities those ways are

510
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,759
being filled but the more we follow

511
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,000
those paths

512
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:28,720
the more also the out there's always the

513
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,119
other side you'll see told you so

514
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,558
right the cannabis guys again

515
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,399
or the cannabis ladies sorry about the

516
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:35,918
cannabis industry again right they'll

517
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,320
find their way they found their way for

518
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,320
30 40 years and that's really not what

519
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,319
we wanted going into the future right or

520
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,879
that's that's what i believe is we have

521
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:46,879
that chance right now to change the tone

522
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,400
to change the actual not just to change

523
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,760
the tonality but also to change the

524
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,360
image of the industry the german

525
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:53,919
coalition they came out together and

526
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:56,159
said look we want to do this together in

527
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,400
the u.s it's the only thing that actual

528
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,080
both sides agree on so there's a big

529
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,080
shift in the world and as long as we

530
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:04,399
wiggle our ways around it and we don't

531
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:06,159
really try to have a clear path

532
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,559
i think it's quite damaging potentially

533
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,558
damaging

534
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,000
that foreign strategies to drive reform

535
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,759
might be damaging and it would be better

536
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,160
for individual countries like

537
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,119
switzerland like holland to develop a

538
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,798
strong

539
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:23,038
gacp

540
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:24,558
policy internally that deals with

541
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,319
cannabis

542
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:28,079
but it still leaves that question if

543
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:31,119
you're not growing

544
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,879
like say germany and you've got reform i

545
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:35,038
mean what what are people supposed to do

546
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,960
import seeds and grow their own i mean

547
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:38,558
that's my question is like what do you

548
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,160
what is the cannabis that you see

549
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,000
especially thc

550
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,919
in this environment that will be allowed

551
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
to cross borders or won't it i mean

552
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,840
maybe it's like the u.s states it's like

553
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,400
holland has its reforms switzerland has

554
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,319
its reform germany has its reform etc

555
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,160
and any cannabis caught going across the

556
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,240
border for recreational use puts you in

557
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,200
jail is that sustainable long-term

558
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,000
either

559
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,000
no i mean i i i think that of course i

560
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,400
agree with you that

561
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,679
people should have a stand in when they

562
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,880
sue however i do tend to agree with with

563
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,679
luke that

564
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,799
the industry as a whole rather rather

565
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,480
than an individual try to set the tones

566
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,798
or set the rules

567
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,839
but if we looking at the other flip side

568
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:22,480
of it

569
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:25,359
infomed in israel just announced

570
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:29,120
recently that they allow cbd but they're

571
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:30,879
not allowed to use for cosmetic

572
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,599
use so

573
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,799
now what all the cbd are out of the

574
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:38,000
shampoo

575
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:39,038
or people will try to find a loophole so

576
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,679
you know

577
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:45,599
same thing in israel they allow the they

578
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:48,720
decriminalize decriminalize cannabis

579
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:50,558
but they excluded

580
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,600
cosmetic products

581
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:53,678
from

582
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,918
cbd are not allowed to use in cosmetic

583
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,440
products so again the government are

584
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,440
also trying to go kind of

585
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,640
one step forward to step backwards so i

586
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,319
think also the government themselves

587
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,559
don't know what they're doing

588
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,319
well that is frequently obviously right

589
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:13,200
the case i want to are there any

590
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,158
questions comments from the audience

591
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,120
so far

592
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,640
ah there's one in the back speak stand

593
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,959
up speak up

594
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,840
i'm just wondering uh as far as uh

595
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,640
once we do get to import export

596
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:26,959
uh

597
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,799
crossing those borders at what point

598
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,480
does it go from

599
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,400
the home like

600
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,599
at what point does the ownership switch

601
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,320
from where that product was um

602
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:41,519
where the product was going to end up

603
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:42,558
does that switch in the air

604
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,119
so

605
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:46,079
so to answer your question first

606
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,678
when you

607
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:50,480
consume when you strip medicinal product

608
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,400
or

609
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,558
for that our case

610
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,919
medicinal

611
00:21:54,558 --> 00:22:00,798
cannabis it has to comply with gdp good

612
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:03,600
distribution practice so the same law

613
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:07,440
that apply for when you send i don't

614
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:10,158
know aspirin from india to uh

615
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,519
to argentina it has to comply with some

616
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,960
certain of

617
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:15,599
legislation

618
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,038
of good distribution practice and this

619
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:19,439
is the the

620
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:22,240
the law that will govern

621
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,919
the same thing with the um

622
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,319
sorry not recreational medicinal

623
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:30,159
cannabis when it comes from colombia to

624
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:32,158
germany or from lasuto to germany

625
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,159
maybe just i think

626
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,000
whenever you have an import in an export

627
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,919
situation you have a buyer and a seller

628
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,240
then you have inco terms the inco terms

629
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,320
is it fob is it free on board is it with

630
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,480
the you know the

631
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,918
freight insurance and taxes it depends

632
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,159
what you actually agree on in the

633
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,720
contract in the buying selling agreement

634
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,039
with whoever you sell it to so when does

635
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,880
the actual responsibility and when does

636
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,960
their payments and all of that go from

637
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,640
one side to the other that is on you to

638
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,240
put it into a contract and that's one of

639
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,840
the things that i meant before when i

640
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,120
said as long as we try to wiggle our

641
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,439
ways around

642
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,519
we do not have access to

643
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,519
institutions that actually protect you

644
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,519
there in any other big commodity

645
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:12,879
industry you have an lc a letter of

646
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:14,400
credit then you have somebody that

647
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,159
guarantees that and you do an income

648
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,320
tournament based on that

649
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,000
the risk and so all of those things all

650
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:22,798
of those things that will allow for a

651
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,038
flourishing industry can only happen if

652
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,798
we it's not just it's not we agreeing on

653
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:29,200
certain terms right it's been all done

654
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:31,440
before uh it's all done in other

655
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,519
industries we just have to kind of it's

656
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,759
like the normalization of the industry

657
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:37,918
and accepting those adapting those

658
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,079
existing laws to it

659
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,840
right so who but i mean i think for

660
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,519
example to answer your question also if

661
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,558
you're importing medical cannabis into

662
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:48,319
germany there is a very complex

663
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:51,278
discussion about who you're importing

664
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:54,480
from the idea of chain of title is very

665
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:56,240
well um i would say established and

666
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,558
there's not a lot of country hopping

667
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,720
right now in europe but that's another

668
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,879
conversation is there another question i

669
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,120
might just look at it add one thing to

670
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,640
that there's a lot of logistics people

671
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:09,038
out there that tell you yeah i'll ship

672
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,960
it anywhere i'll ship it anywhere and as

673
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:12,960
long as you don't see the declaration

674
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,720
form on the import side so you always

675
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,159
have two sides and specifically if you

676
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,839
go with narcotics or if you go in

677
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,919
anything that is on a higher compliance

678
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:22,079
level you want to make sure that whoever

679
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,240
you sell to either has an agent on the

680
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,599
other side a customs agent or that the

681
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,839
person that wants to sell you that

682
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:29,599
logistical services provides you with

683
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,278
somebody else on the other side

684
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:32,879
otherwise they'll take the job they'll

685
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:34,159
ship the shipment and once it's in the

686
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,760
air or somewhere in between they'll say

687
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,520
like oh well you didn't declare it on

688
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,440
the other side and then they'll have a

689
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:40,879
nice lawyer that will tell you here look

690
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,400
i'll help you out of it and in the end

691
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,960
you lose a lot of money and your product

692
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,480
is also gone so just

693
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,558
be yeah

694
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,319
look at look at how it's done in many of

695
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:51,678
the other industries and kind of try to

696
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:52,399
follow

697
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,320
and

698
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,480
yeah don't get creative don't get

699
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:58,798
creative importing you know

700
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,798
no no that's not a good idea anybody

701
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:01,798
else

702
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,839
no okay

703
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:07,200
well um

704
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:10,240
where is where is the audience from

705
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,440
mostly is this mostly european or u.s

706
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,038
u.s european

707
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,120
a little bit of a mix

708
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:18,798
okay so from the us audience perspective

709
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:22,158
though this whole idea of shipping

710
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:24,720
across borders is still pretty unique

711
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:27,039
right so maybe you can maybe elaborate a

712
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,880
little bit more on what the procedures

713
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:30,480
are oh are we running out of time we

714
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,120
have like 10 minutes you have time oh

715
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,880
okay i'm sure you have a question guys

716
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,639
oh they told me you guys were taking

717
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,240
questions already yes we're taking

718
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,278
questions we're continuing with that

719
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,960
conversation it's an open oh creative

720
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:44,240
cannabis sort of

721
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,000
you didn't come for a question didn't

722
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,038
come with a question uh yes i have a

723
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,319
question how dare you no i'm kidding

724
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:54,359
you know duck

725
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:54,359
you know the answer to that

726
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,079
uh what were we talking about

727
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,919
were you did someone have a question

728
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,759
well we we'd already taken one question

729
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,640
from the audience somebody in the very

730
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:09,420
very back there was raising the answer

731
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,469
guy you interrupted our conversation

732
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,469
[Music]

733
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,400
so

734
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,640
the whole that whole you know import

735
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,480
export or supply chain or market access

736
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,200
is is a big subject and it's actually

737
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,440
kind of what what i base my my whole

738
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,640
what we're doing on was uh i don't know

739
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,960
i'm not gonna hear

740
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,360
not gonna make a sales pitch but we we

741
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,600
created a compliance software with the

742
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,918
whole focus of how can we solve the

743
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,678
problem of market accessibility how can

744
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,759
we look how can we create something that

745
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,200
allows for standardization along the

746
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:42,960
supply chain and along the different

747
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,200
players in the supply chain that then

748
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,440
allows them to work with each other in

749
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,519
the back end also have an automated

750
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,080
reporting system that then allows you to

751
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:55,038
access new markets right and all on a

752
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:56,960
very standardized but not nothing new

753
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:58,558
nothing you know too cutting edge over

754
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,079
the top something that's auditable by

755
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:01,440
the government because they want to do

756
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,000
that if they want to allow you to ship

757
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,640
to certain places and really take a slow

758
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,640
approach slow and steady and get there

759
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,480
and don't try to hoop don't try to jump

760
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,640
the hoop and don't try to go you know

761
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,440
too fast and which sometimes like the

762
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,520
kind of a case it's great if a president

763
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,960
case has been has been formed

764
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:20,879
but in the end of the day it's really

765
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,880
about slowly building this industry from

766
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,480
the ground up and not taking shortcuts

767
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,480
because that will just bring you

768
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,399
well what's that game with the ladder

769
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,000
you know when you go too fast you can

770
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:32,000
fall very far so

771
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,319
slow and steady

772
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,079
yeah on that note i definitely agree

773
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,839
again with with

774
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:40,480
luke and and that's basically what i

775
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:42,480
said in initially if we convince the the

776
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,200
authorities uh

777
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,519
whether the local government or the

778
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:51,278
federal government that that product is

779
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:53,440
is a good kosher up to standard

780
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:56,720
then obviously there's a way better way

781
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:59,519
for us to again as an industry to

782
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,720
persuade and change the law and like i

783
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,918
said maybe someone pick up the glove of

784
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,000
a

785
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,038
veterinarian product

786
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,079
um

787
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:12,558
certainly you know people like

788
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:15,839
in america

789
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:18,639
they they a lot of pets so so they they

790
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:21,599
do that there for cbd product for pair

791
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,880
for dogs etc

792
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:24,158
but

793
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,080
i i do

794
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,799
think that

795
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:32,000
again i am coming from the medicinal

796
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:34,319
background i don't do any of the

797
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,440
recreational

798
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:39,119
and i

799
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:41,679
everything that i do is about compliance

800
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:44,398
and i think i find that the only way to

801
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:48,798
to change the market and then change to

802
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:52,239
the attitude is is basically to convince

803
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:53,200
the regulators that you know we do our

804
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,798
part

805
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,840
but you see this is a domestic

806
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:57,278
discussion

807
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:58,398
it that's i think what we're saying this

808
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:00,240
is a much more

809
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:02,158
domestic discussion than cross-border

810
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,880
discussion but obviously we get into it

811
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,240
was there another question from the back

812
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,240
no

813
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,839
okay but that's what but i didn't think

814
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,319
from an american perspective it's a

815
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,599
state-by-state conversation still right

816
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:15,439
if if you're going to produce if you're

817
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:17,278
going to sell in colorado you have to

818
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,080
grow in colorado you cannot cross

819
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:23,119
borders with anything except i guess at

820
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:26,720
this point cbd right the thc discussion

821
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:30,000
still a state date by state conversation

822
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,940
yes and no because if you look at places

823
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,798
like

824
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:36,080
[Music]

825
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:38,240
you know mississippi obviously they not

826
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:41,359
regulated yet

827
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,159
they regulated for medicinal but you not

828
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:47,199
regulated for for other jews

829
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,960
but if you look at the uh across this uh

830
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,278
just the town

831
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,240
from the other states just across the

832
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:54,480
road

833
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,359
you can see that people

834
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,679
from that state actually driving

835
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:02,158
you know 50 miles just to cross the

836
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,880
border and get it you know

837
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,360
for

838
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,520
crazy americans that's a different story

839
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,959
though

840
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:10,639
i think it's a big chance for us in

841
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,720
europe to do something different and to

842
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,440
really not follow this follow suit and

843
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,880
not you know we find a harmonized system

844
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,038
that works across borders and that

845
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,440
allows for the trade to flourish and

846
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:23,200
then i think that's that's what you know

847
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,720
events like this and panels like this

848
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,480
and general uh

849
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,159
compliance efforts and and

850
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,759
standardization efforts are all about

851
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,840
and should be about right finding

852
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,919
something that works for everyone

853
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:36,158
and then make that actionable and then

854
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,399
based on that you know create something

855
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,760
beautiful but there's still disagreement

856
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:41,359
about i mean there's a lot of

857
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,519
disagreement right and there's there are

858
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:47,599
those for example who have for those of

859
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:50,319
you don't know imported i would say gacp

860
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:52,398
product into certain companies countries

861
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:55,918
here in europe and then

862
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:57,839
transformed that into eu gmp and then

863
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,919
shipped it somewhere else

864
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:02,319
is that a helpful strategy or is that a

865
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:05,759
confusing one speaking about industry

866
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:08,879
coalescence around common practices

867
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:11,119
well i uh i read a lot

868
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,120
and

869
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:16,000
there is also these are saying that any

870
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:19,679
every revolution

871
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,798
has three stages the first stage

872
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,399
they

873
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:25,038
fight you

874
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:27,839
sorry the first stage is they ignore you

875
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:29,119
the second stage they fight you and the

876
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:31,199
third state

877
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,278
they take you for granted

878
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,240
so i think that

879
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:39,038
what i feel is that the recreational

880
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,000
market should take a step back

881
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:44,720
and figure out that we've done quite a

882
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:49,278
long way since you know i don't know

883
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:51,679
2010 or 2006 or 2015

884
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:55,679
to what we are today and it's been only

885
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,880
seven years um if i look at

886
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,759
again

887
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,480
the

888
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:02,640
after the 1930 with the drought

889
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,240
lost in the in the state

890
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,559
it took the liquor companies 15 years to

891
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,399
pick up with demands

892
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:12,319
15 years

893
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:15,119
and now obviously you can buy liquor

894
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:16,639
store anywhere but 15 years people had

895
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:19,359
to do

896
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,600
beers and and alcohol in their backyard

897
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:23,038
because there was not enough product in

898
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:24,158
the market so

899
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:26,398
again

900
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,559
we as

901
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:29,518
driving the market or

902
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:31,200
helping

903
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,440
forming the market we have to take a

904
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,960
step back and realize that we did quite

905
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,000
a long way

906
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,558
and

907
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,038
we have to be patient that's my personal

908
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:41,038
opinion

909
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,159
any any other thoughts

910
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:48,079
wise words from a wise man exactly

911
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,600
exactly well i think maybe we're at the

912
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:52,079
end of this conversation unless you'd

913
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:54,719
like to add anything else

914
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:56,319

00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,840
the local and buy some moroccan hash

while i'm in california

932

it's coming i mean we used to be able to

933
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:34,159
buy a rocking hash but it was way

934
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,679
against the law

935
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,360
and now it's legal and you can't you

936
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,720
have to come out here to get it which is

937
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:41,439
