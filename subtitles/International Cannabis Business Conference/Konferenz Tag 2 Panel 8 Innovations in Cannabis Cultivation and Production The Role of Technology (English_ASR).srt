the Netherlands and we help The Growers

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,698
and investors from business ID towards

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,100
cultivation and cultivation support

12
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,039
that's a short video

13
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:32,219
my name is Lucas targos I am the VP of

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,260

15
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:37,200
formerly was a commercial vegetable

16
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:39,058
grower turned to cannabis grower and now

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,000
have worked for urban growth for about

18
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:45,238
eight years we really specialize in full

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,939
design build projects specifically on

20
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:50,339
cultivation facilities

21
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:54,000
hello my name is Sabrina Carvalho and I

22
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:57,120
am the Cannabis specialist developing r

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,698

24
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,500
hi everyone I'm Darren Kaplan I'm a

25
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:03,718
senior consultant for sustanza Global

26

cannabis facilities around the world and

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,939
we're based in Canada

30
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:14,219
and my backgrounds come Academia and

31
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:16,319
also a grower so kind of both the

32
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:17,760
science and the Practical aspect of

33
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,339
growing

34
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,560
a wonderful good afternoon my name is

35
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,240
Timo I'm the general manager of fluence

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,740
fluence is a Horticulture lighting

37
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:30,419
company and we are all happy to be here

38
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:31,859
thanks Timo

39
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,540
um so chatting about Innovations in

40
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:35,459
cannabis cultivation is obviously a very

41
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,079
large topic so we wanted to kind of

42
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:38,699
start off talking with the very early

43
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:40,919
phases of development which is

44
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,780
propagation and tissue culture so we'll

45
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,978
start off with what are some of the

46
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,840
major advancements that you've seen

47
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:48,060
maybe in the last year or so in that

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,920
field of both sourcing fantastic

49
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,180
genetics and the technologies that we

50
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,340
can use to ensure that we have a great

51
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,540
start to the grow

52
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,520
well

53
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,140
well maybe I give it a start I'll take

54
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,199
the advantage

55
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,840
ladies first well one of the advances

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,719
that actually we ourselves worked on is

57
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,118
on recipes specifically used for

58
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,038
propagation and tissue culture So

59
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:15,060
currently we have

60
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:17,759
rolled out the recipes of LEDs specific

61
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:21,180
to improve propagation

62
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:23,459
we managed to improve propagation in all

63
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,040
aspects of it from speeding when it's

64
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,300
difficult from

65
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,098
situations like Germany where you cannot

66
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,379
use rooting hormones it is a challenge

67
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:33,899
we created recipes for that that Growers

68
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:35,219
can use and we find that we are well at

69
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,800
least that one we are very proud of

70
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:39,780
bringing to the market

71
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,599
um but genetics indeed also very

72
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,659
important working with breathers is very

73
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:48,780
important having bad genetics for

74
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:51,359
rooting can kill your business so yes

75
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,400
Choose Wisely if you go for it and now I

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,680
would say is also very important

77
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,200
yeah

78
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,420
um yeah on my side I would say that

79
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:02,878
we're seeing a lot more of

80
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:04,679
um desire to have tissue culture labs

81
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,539
and practices within the facilities on

82
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,219
the early stages it's definitely become

83
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:10,280
an evolution

84
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:13,500
um and and a lot more standards around

85
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,500
tissue culture for cannabis specifically

86
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,959
which I think is it's very good and

87
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,120
um you know I think as most people know

88
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,319
there's there's certain viruses that are

89
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,539
kind of working their way through the

90
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,579
industry right now and tissue culture

91
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:29,699
provides a very

92
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,099
helpful Safety Net in that so I think

93
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:33,899
that whether it's a retrofit or or

94
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:36,479
you're looking at you know building your

95
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,760
first facility uh allocating that space

96
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,798
to some sort of tissue culture ability

97
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:43,318
tissue culture lab

98
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,700
um Can can de-risk a lot within the

99
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:47,158
facility and then also provide that

100
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:48,899
genetic security there as well too and

101
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:50,759
maybe in addition that you also have the

102
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,860
possibility to have the back up at

103
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,259
another location right so from a

104
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,480
business model it makes you a little bit

105
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:59,759
more resilient and if you have a problem

106
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:02,280
that you have maybe somewhere back up so

107
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,780
I think that makes a lot of sense yeah

108
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,400
because if you Outsource it what

109
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,560
happened what a lot of people try to do

110
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,379
is the risk for getting something in

111
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,539
from the supply you buy it from so that

112
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:14,639
is for me always a risk factor that have

113
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:17,219
it on your own you you can really

114
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,918
preserve that things go wrong like

115
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,000
getting in let them over it in for

116
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,240
example

117
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,360
you know in a way tissue culture

118
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,900
nowadays when I talk to Growers many of

119
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,540
us we create varieties that we love they

120
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:36,539
are unique to us and we find that that

121
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:39,000
is amazing variety that I managed to

122
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,699
create right

123
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,220
tissue culture to me for this type of

124
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:47,040
love for a specific variety for whatever

125
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:50,040
reason you like it is your safety net

126
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,240
you can have it now and in 10 years from

127
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,699
now

128
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:58,319
you can always go back to it it's safe

129
00:04:53,699 --> 00:05:00,840
so I find that at least for even from

130
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,120
the most unique varieties to scale up

131
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:06,119
production tissue culture has its place

132
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,819
for this aspect of innovation you can

133
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,519
always go back to it many of the Growers

134
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:13,918
that we talk to they actually say oh the

135
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:17,279
variety that I had or that somebody had

136
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:19,560
and that we lost tissue culture will

137
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:22,739
even in the future can you imagine

138
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,439
having a library of a collection of

139
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,660
breeds that I can a hundred years ago

140
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,439
somebody used and we can still look at

141
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,560
it

142
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:33,418
and it's becoming yes more and more

143
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,160
important this past couple years with

144
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:37,139
very much yes you mentioned the virus

145
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,639
The Hop Lane thyroid is probably one of

146
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,199
the biggest concerns with cannabis

147
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,500
Growers right now and in Canada

148
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:45,180
specifically it's maybe 90 of the

149
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,579
facilities I've heard numbers around

150
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,379
there are infected and once your

151
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:51,959
genetics are infected if your mother's

152
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:53,399
stock is infected it's there might not

153
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:56,219
even be a way of getting rid of it no

154
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:57,959
yeah having tissue culture reserves is

155
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,360
kind of one of your only ways of really

156
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:02,159
securing your genetics so yeah I believe

157
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,960
tissue culture is the only way to rid

158
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,360
the facility of it and it's a very scary

159
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:07,439
virus too because it's

160
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,580
um from what we're seeing right now

161
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,038
stable

162
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:12,959
um even in water which is that's right

163
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,639
um yes and even traditional tissue

164
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,099
culture if you're doing nodal culture

165
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,660
it's not effective yeah so you need to

166
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,120
be doing meristem culture which takes a

167
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,460
long time and it doesn't always work so

168
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,199
starting with clean stock yeah exactly

169
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:28,019
so I think it's less of a fear fear

170
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,300
tactic and more of a reality necessity

171
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:32,459
backups yeah when we started seeing

172
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,840
tissue culture in Canada in 2018 I

173
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,459
worked at one of the earliest tissue

174
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,219
culture facilities it was just an

175
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:39,659
internal lab for ourselves but it was

176
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,160
very hot and heavy at that time everyone

177
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,560
was very interested and then everyone

178
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,300
got a little bit less excited about it

179
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,699
because it's not a fully proven method

180
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,960
it's not cookie cutter cop and paste I

181
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,639
can't just take my protocols and use

182
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,799
them for the 700 cultivars you want to

183
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,720
work with so it requires a lot of time

184
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,939
effort and expertise which is something

185
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,080
that was not as readily available in the

186
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:59,459
industry and money you know it's not

187
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,779
something that you can just pump a

188
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:02,818
couple hundred thousand dollars into and

189
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,559
be for sure guaranteed all the cultivars

190
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,819
are going to work so that's really

191
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,978
interesting for me to see in the last

192
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:09,900
year or two is kind of the the rise of

193
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:12,000
tissue culture again because it's become

194
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:13,978
an absolute necessity using a continual

195
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,500
mother clone system indefinitely with no

196
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:17,579
backup and having cannabis grown at a

197
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,079
commercial level where it's never been

198
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:20,879
grown before and hasn't been bred

199
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,399
specifically for resistances to a

200
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,500
variety of pests and viruses it means

201
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:26,939
that it's something that everyone should

202
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,639
be looking at in their cultivation

203
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:31,680
strategy if you're not it's very risky

204
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,360
like Sabrina said you could breed

205
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,280
something for a very long time have a

206
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,319
fantastic genetic and then lose it in

207
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,179
the matter of a few months so I think

208
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,919
that's a really big area that I'm glad

209
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,538
to see Europe actually I feel has been

210
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,159
more on the Forefront of that there are

211
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:45,719
very few European clients that I have

212
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,280
that have not already begun their

213
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,440
strategy with tissue culture either

214
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,239
internally or looking for somebody to

215
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,019
Source it and do it externally so I

216
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,000
think that's been a really big

217
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:55,198
Improvement

218
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,120
um along the lines of kind of moving

219
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,639
past our tissue culture and propagation

220
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,439
phase moving into kind of cultivation a

221
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,240
mix of both veg and flour there's a

222
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,098
number of questions there one I wanted

223
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,538
to start off with is environmental

224
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:09,180
sustainability so as we all know

225
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:10,259
cannabis is bashed very often for not

226
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,180
being the most environmentally

227
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,560
sustainable industry especially when

228
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,840
you're doing indoor cultivation which is

229
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,579
predominantly what I work in it's very

230
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:18,839
power heavy and those of us in Europe

231
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:21,000
who have felt the increase in power

232
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:23,098
prices in the last year we can really

233
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,538
attest to that so I wanted to know what

234
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:26,038
if anyone has seen anything very

235
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:27,598
interesting along the lines of more

236
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,279
environmental sustainability in

237
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,199
basically any of your flower cultivation

238
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,819
projects

239
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,918
yes

240
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:38,300
and I think that's only at least can

241
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:38,299
also say that yes

242
00:08:38,778 --> 00:08:45,720
let's put it this way I I don't know a

243
00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:47,838
lot about a lot about other regions but

244
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:52,139
in European Union you have two things

245
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:54,660
one is the rules of a country and then

246
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:57,240
the rules of European Union

247
00:08:54,659 --> 00:09:00,240
we all know that European Union will

248
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,940
become more strict on how much energy we

249
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,278
can spend whether we like it or not we

250
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,620
need to be sustainable growing our crops

251
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,539
independent of what it is the

252
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,240
Netherlands for example is already

253
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:14,699
starting to apply that and planning to

254
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,039
apply it even more fiercely and we are

255
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,360
talking about

256
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:21,899
situations where they say we will only

257
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:25,019
support with subsidies or discounts or

258
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:28,139
whatever else if you fulfill this energy

259
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:31,560
gap if you go over it you will not be

260
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:32,458
supported you will not and can you

261
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:34,079
imagine

262
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,699
everybody here is going to kill me for

263
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,080
that but doesn't matter

264
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:42,600
um tomato right now high high okra yes

265
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,360
the Netherlands is sporting sustainable

266
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,399
measures of if you want to be supported

267
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,919
you will need to be within this energy

268
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:52,440
gap and every single grower that has

269
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:55,919
been doing this for years is asking how

270
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,740
do we even hit this target

271
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:01,979
if they would put anywhere near to that

272
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,879
Target to cannabis right now we would be

273
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,519
in trouble

274
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,980
so we all need to start thinking of our

275
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,259
projects of how can we make it more

276
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,420
sustainable in numbers not even even for

277
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:14,399
spending less money of hours but

278
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:16,740
accounting already that if you're going

279
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,958
to do that in Europe you will have these

280
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:22,139
coming sooner or later so we better

281
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:24,479
prepare to how low can we go with our

282
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:27,659
energies and so on to get a good crop a

283
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,759
balance crop what can we do together to

284
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:31,679
lower it because this they will come

285
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,259
these rules will come it's it's just a

286
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,958
matter of time and for us if we can get

287
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:40,620
on the front line of saying

288
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:43,679
we know how low we can get and European

289
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,600
Union can say okay hopefully soon they

290
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,399
will say we will listen and we will

291
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,278
consider those if we can have that

292
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,958
influence great that's how I see it

293
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:55,200
European Union will always come with

294
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:57,599
rules on them sooner or later yeah but

295
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,060
it's not only the the energy it's also

296
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,100
water yes like in in Netherlands we

297
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:05,099
already have an Horticultural world the

298
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,339
zero emission law by 2027 so from that

299
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,200
moment Growers cannot

300
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:12,180
discharge any water anymore so all the

301
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,180
water they are using and coming back

302
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:17,759
from the rain they need to disinfect and

303
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:20,578
reuse so it's not only the energy part

304
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,439
by yeah you guys with with fluence and

305
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:24,599
Phillips work on and reducing the energy

306
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:28,140
costs it is also all the other sources

307
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,639
we use to grow our plants and it's not

308
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:31,500
really a common practice for cannabis

309
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,379
Growers to recirculate no it's not it's

310
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,759
complicated and also with the way that

311
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:37,980
cannabis Growers have learned to grow

312
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,620
with specific brands of fertilizer and

313
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,180
products if you're recirculating your

314
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,240
nutrient solution you have to readjust

315
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:47,159
specific elements and it's not an easy

316
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,959
thing to do if you don't understand each

317
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,179
component of your fertilizer that you're

318
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,799
using so it's I think it's a lot of

319
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:54,539
learning and a lot of learning from

320
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,159
what's happening in Europe and in the

321
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:58,500
Netherlands because it's been happening

322
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,600
for a long time yeah yeah so we we work

323
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,120
on the Wastewater management side a lot

324
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,860
and it's been a long road and I think

325
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,259
the biggest difficulty is that in a lot

326
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,839
of cannabis fertilizer regimenes you see

327
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:12,659
two things that are very difficult from

328
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:16,500
a recirculation is high heavy metals and

329
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:19,860
a lot of organic materials which make UV

330
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,419
um not not as effective to get the

331
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,159
transmission through so we've had to

332
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:25,740
really play around with a lot of

333
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:27,600
different Technologies mainly I would

334
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,759
say the one that is really making moves

335
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,540
through the entire Horticulture industry

336
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:36,059
is Ozone as a very well wave of

337
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:37,919
disinfecting water and then we also talk

338
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:39,899
about a lot on the the condensate

339
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:41,759
recapture as well too so recapturing

340
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:43,139
recapturing all the condensate that's

341
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:44,399
being produced from the HVAC from the

342
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:46,440
facility

343
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,879
um and you know utilizing pretty some

344
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,399
pretty simple ways believe it or not

345
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:52,620
that's that that is very clean water but

346
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,019
it's so clean it's too clean

347
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,899
um so it's very easy to end up getting

348
00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:00,240
biological growth within there so

349
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:02,159
um it's something that I think is going

350
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,720
to be a large part of the evolution of

351
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,419
the industry because as you mentioned

352
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,160
with a recirculating system there's a

353
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:10,620
lot of commercial Horticultural

354
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,199
practices that need to be taken place in

355
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,419
order to have those systems operate

356
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:18,660
properly I will say that we've been able

357
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:21,240
to kind of make a hybrid and a lot of

358
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:22,740
times bring in more of a blending system

359
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,659
to where we're actually blending that

360
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,899
recirculation with a direct inject

361
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:30,778
system to allow us to kind of have a

362
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:35,278
happy happy medium right closed yeah

363
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:37,740
exactly well to add on that I think that

364
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:40,980
for example nowadays cannabis Growers

365
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:45,778
Focus indeed on breeding to a specific

366
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:48,000
Niche choices of looks smells and so on

367
00:13:45,778 --> 00:13:50,578
but I think that the true Innovation

368
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,700
will come when we mix that with

369
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:56,219
efficiency choosing the varieties that

370
00:13:53,700 --> 00:14:00,899
also bring the efficiency into account

371
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:02,519
we can have really nice varieties but we

372
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:05,039
have to have the notion that they are

373
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:07,560
very expensive to run we have clients

374
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,778
asking us I am from light but we have

375
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:12,419
clients asking us to actually increase

376
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:13,799
light to a light level to achieve a

377
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:16,439
yield that they want with this

378
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:18,719
particular variety while we prefer to

379
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,680
actually look at it and ask can we breed

380
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,240
something similar but that operates at a

381
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:26,879
reasonable level

382
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,000
because we can't keep going higher and

383
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:32,338
higher even biologically these plants

384
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,379
cannot take everything they are amazing

385
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:35,700
plants they are very flexible but they

386
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:38,100
cannot take everything

387
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,680
and one of the things that also clients

388
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,480
of ours and of all of us are suffering

389
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,698
from is that technology is advancing

390
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,240
many of these breeds they were bred for

391
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:51,179
sunlight for HPS for

392
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,419
whatever it was being used in each

393
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:57,778
region and LEDs are a technology that

394
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:59,039
pushes these plants much harder it's is

395
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:01,980
unique

396
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,899
but breeds need to keep up with that we

397
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:06,420
have technology sometimes that for us is

398
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:08,759
innovative but is waiting for the other

399
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:11,039
Innovations to come in breathing is one

400
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:14,519
of those we only now are not starting

401
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:17,338
it's it's whether we like it or not for

402
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,019
this capacity and scale out we only now

403
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:21,660
are starting on the efficiency of having

404
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:25,500
good crops that can handle a reasonable

405
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:27,240
level so I I think that breathing will

406
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,578
change a lot of the techniques and will

407
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,440
help another a lot of the technologies

408
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:34,500
that we have and that we are developing

409
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,300
work better as well but yeah working

410
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,000
with breeders is important on that as

411
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:40,679
well I would say maybe the common look

412
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,539
as you mentioned about heavy metals that

413
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:44,759
that can be also a problem thing that

414
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:48,240
also starts with making the right

415
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:51,480
choices for your starting order your

416
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,579
your fertilizers so use high quality

417
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,379
brands for fertilizers and for

418
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:57,599
substrates so that you don't get it into

419
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:59,578
a system and then I agree if you have it

420
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,659
then it's difficult to get out of it of

421
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:02,399
course yeah yeah and I think there's

422
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:04,919
there's been luckily has been definitely

423
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,000
a movement around from where we were

424
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:10,740
back in the day of you know shelf bought

425
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,360
liquid fertilizers that are extremely

426
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,379
expensive not that I'm bashing on them

427
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,060
but

428
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:17,639
um there's a better route right and you

429
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:18,899
get better quality better consistency

430
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,839
um and you'll see that both in the

431
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,980
product but also in your systems just in

432
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,199
everyday use

433
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,879
yeah and so from facility design that's

434
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,159
super important so when you are

435
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,419
designing your cannabis facility I think

436
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:32,039
everyone knows in this industry it's

437
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:34,019
really important to be flexible and it's

438
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:35,338
really important to understand even if

439
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:37,019
you're in an Emerging Market there are

440
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:38,579
more developed Markets Canada being

441
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:40,139
example certain countries in Europe

442
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:41,879
where you can look at the lessons

443
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:43,259
learned and make sure that you have the

444
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:45,600
ability to Pivot that's what I always

445
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:48,060
encourage my clients to do have the

446
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,920
ability to be flexible and malleable as

447
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:52,258
the market progresses and so with your

448
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,939
facility design I have a client and they

449
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:55,199
did you know direct you know water to

450
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,060
waste because they said their water was

451
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,979
really cheap and I said it's not about

452
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:00,599
just the price of the water that you

453
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,759
make these decisions that's not the

454
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,439
guiding force and surprise surprise the

455
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:06,240
government has now said that they cannot

456
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,380
put all of their water into waste but we

457
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,419
don't have any space to put a

458
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,679
recirculating system so this is one of

459
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:12,540
the fun little challenges but it's

460
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,100
really important to work with really

461
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:15,539
experienced Developers for facilities

462
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,859
that will tell you your options and let

463
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:18,058
you know why you should do these things

464
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:20,578
and why you should have these options

465
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:21,959
available but not only water and power

466
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:22,859
we were just talking about you know the

467
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,919
things you actually put into your

468
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:27,418
products so cannabis is very garbage and

469
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,679
garbage out if you don't use good

470
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:30,840
quality lights if you don't use good

471
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:34,080
quality substrate fertilizers Etc you

472
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:35,399
don't get I would say the robustness of

473
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:36,659
that genetic you're really not doing

474
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,640
yourself any favors you're not getting

475
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,080
the full capacity so

476
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,880
um there's also been a lot of questions

477
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,379
regarding substrates in particular and

478
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,660
the environment sustainability of things

479
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,160
like rock wool and cocopeat and things

480
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,259
along those lines so have you had a lot

481
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,660
of clients or any projects they've been

482
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:53,220
working on where you found that you're

483
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,320
kind of battling with them about making

484
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,759
the more sustainable choice for their

485
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:58,678
own kind of betterment in the long term

486
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:00,419
but they're kind of maybe hung up on a

487
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:03,179
practice they've had previously and not

488
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:05,400
really willing to let it go

489
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:07,200
um nine out of ten yeah

490
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,980
I think I think cannabis is pretty good

491
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,900
on the uh let's say the Kobo for example

492
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,720
a lot of cannabis Growers are pushing

493
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,400
for Cocoa ahead of really having to make

494
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,860
those decisions

495
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,600
um a lot of rock will Growers still but

496
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:23,639
compared to

497
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,259
let's say other crops I think there are

498
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,700
a lot of progressive thinking cannabis

499
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:28,440
Growers that really do want to push the

500
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,700
sustainability and the substrate is

501
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,700
usually the first thing that they'll go

502
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:37,019
with LEDs and the substrate

503
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:39,538
I would like to say that this

504
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:41,279
the struggle is not the material you're

505
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:44,099
using

506
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:46,798
many materials that for at a certain

507
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:49,019
scale one substrate that you're using

508
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:52,079
can be the best substrate you have

509
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:54,000
but if you're moving to scale up or if

510
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:56,038
you're moving to a different way of

511
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,298
growing if you're applying a different

512
00:18:56,038 --> 00:19:01,500
technology and with that technology you

513
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:03,538
could have the problem that that

514
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,480
substrate is no longer the best solution

515
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:07,259
for that is we need to understand is

516
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,558
that

517
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:12,779
many of us whether we are doing for

518
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:16,579
recreational small scale recreational

519
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:19,859
bigger scale medicinal this and that

520
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:23,298
clubs and so on there are products that

521
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:26,939
work very well now for a particular

522
00:19:23,298 --> 00:19:29,099
system that having this project

523
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,798
insisting that they will continue with

524
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:34,980
that product towards the other system

525
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:38,700
and we can't change that my lights

526
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:40,980
cannot fix is the choice of you choosing

527
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,538
to go with that particular substrate is

528
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,880
not fair to the substrate it's not fair

529
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:47,640
to the lights or it's not fair to the to

530
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,860
the irrigation system you chose we have

531
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:53,299
to be very careful is with the choices

532
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:55,859
we do with the combinations we do please

533
00:19:53,298 --> 00:19:58,079
if you would come to me and I would say

534
00:19:55,859 --> 00:20:00,000
with my light I know from experience

535
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,519
with other clients that we had that they

536
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,319
are applying this this same method they

537
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:06,839
have a hard time with it you would

538
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,639
please consider something else we can

539
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:10,740
even tell you well you can talk to this

540
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,500
person that person that person

541
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:16,140
please we can't fix that

542
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,119
it is it's literally that and many of

543
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,460
these Innovations they work on the right

544
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:23,819
place many of these Innovations are

545
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:26,038
coming they work for their place don't

546
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:29,819
try to push it to work everywhere else

547
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:31,679
they have a place for a reason so many

548
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:34,139
of these I believe that is more about

549
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,880
the balance of where they work best not

550
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,740
that they are wrong or that they don't

551
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,539
work at all I think if you look to

552
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,120
substrates we all know that we can grow

553
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:44,339
in all type of substrates but clearly in

554
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:47,279
the medicinal markets in Europe you see

555
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:49,678
a movement and Trend towards Stone why

556
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:52,859
because it's clean and inert and you

557
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,900
start uniform and that is always more

558
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:57,659
difficult if you grow in soil or cocope

559
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,580
because it's the mixture so having from

560
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:02,279
one port to another Port exactly the

561
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:04,319
same is more difficult it's just logical

562
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:07,200
so therefore you see a movement for

563
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,819
clean inert product with Stonewall I

564
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,740
think at Timo you also see that

565
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:12,359
everywhere like in June they were

566
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,579
talking even for the three medicinal

567
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:15,899
license holders you only way Eastern

568
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:18,418
will because of that

569
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:21,960
you're absolutely right so because it's

570
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:23,640
mainly a medical Market obviously the

571
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,200
product quality and stability is

572
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:29,820
extremely important and with Rockwell

573
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:32,340
you have a clean orig starting point but

574
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:35,579
still the rockwool issue is an issue

575
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:36,779
what do we do afterwards that is you

576
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:39,298
know you brought it up at the beginning

577
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:41,759
the question was about sustainability so

578
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,619
there is a question unanswered we answer

579
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,960
one question safe product for the

580
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:48,178
patients we don't answer the question

581
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,798
what to do with the with the waste

582
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:51,120
product now you have in the Netherlands

583
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:52,619
but that's only in the Netherlands so

584
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,019
you're not going to transport if you

585
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:56,759
grow in Germany all your stone will end

586
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:58,500
product to the Netherlands for that

587
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:00,839
recycling solution so it's also a matter

588
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,419
of having sufficient volume where all

589
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:05,038
the Growers are to have this in place

590
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:07,020
but you're right that is at this moment

591
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:07,879
a tricky point but I think that's also

592
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:10,319
an

593
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,240
opportunity for people to see that

594
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:13,798
there's there's gaps within receiving

595
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,659
yes programs right and that that's

596
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:17,639
that's a there's a big use for it right

597
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:19,380
so those markets that need them I mean

598
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,538
it's a great it's a great area to look

599
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,220
into yeah you are entitled if you are

600
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:25,079
working now or even if you're developing

601
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,380
a project you are entitled to ask every

602
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:29,639
single company what is your disposal

603
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:31,320
techniques protocols do you have it can

604
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,259
you receive it back what is the

605
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:37,019
recycling program all of that just ask

606
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:39,058
it needs to fit into your guidelines how

607
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:41,639
it's like is a waste you need to get rid

608
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:45,359
of it if it is a circular economy or not

609
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,919
we have a lot of uh cocoa developments

610
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,259
they are improving a lot and developing

611
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:51,240
a lot as well because exactly that they

612
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:53,339
are challenged they need to keep up with

613
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:57,359
the with the techniques even for

614
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:59,639
cannabis uh we see a lot of these

615
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:01,740
um substrate irrigation systems as one

616
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,820
improving a lot and

617
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:08,038
I I find that more often than not if you

618
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:10,918
ask companies that are doing this job

619
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:13,919
and that they are working

620
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:15,900
fiercely to improve they will give you

621
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,400
an answer of where they are in that

622
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,900
stage they will have no problems

623
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,480
addressing the fact that they will say

624
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:25,980
in your region we have no capacity to do

625
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,538
that and it's fine it's just fine if you

626
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,000
have in your region someone that is

627
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:32,940
capable of doing that now good but

628
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
sometimes even the companies take it as

629
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:38,519
is it good challenge

630
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,380
the companies to do that and ask them to

631
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,000
do that most of the times they will be

632
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,280
honest enough to say well it will take

633
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,900
us a couple of years but we accept the

634
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:48,178
fact that this is a new challenge for us

635
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,400
sometimes we even are the ones telling

636
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:53,100
exactly please be prepared

637
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,480
because we foresee that in the next

638
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:57,058
three years something is going to happen

639
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,779
so if you cannot prepare for that then

640
00:23:57,058 --> 00:24:02,579
we can't do it anymore so ask talk

641
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:04,500
interact if you don't like the answer

642
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:06,658
just say that you didn't like that you

643
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:09,058
need that you want something better yet

644
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:11,700
we are all working for improving uh uh

645
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:13,139
Even in our own Innovations sometimes I

646
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,120
have an idea that I think is great and

647
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,580
everybody looks at me that is great but

648
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:19,439
expensive and I was like okay I need to

649
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:21,899
make it cheaper okay how to fix that

650
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,600
right we like the challenges because if

651
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,038
we don't talk and interact we don't

652
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:28,199
make it better

653
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:30,720
I agree and I think that we touched on

654
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,759
something here which is that to do

655
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,079
medical grade cannabis is not the most

656
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:35,400
sustainable practice because the most

657
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,319
sustainable way to grow cannabis is to

658
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,240
put it in a field outside but then you

659
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:40,619
have this like large level of

660
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,880
variability between the crops so you're

661
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:43,439
not really meeting kind of that

662
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,659
tolerance limit you want for your cfas

663
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,100
we like growing in rockwool for many of

664
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:48,480
my clients because it's inert because

665
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:50,219
it's clean because it's something that

666
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,240
we can get consistency of A's on and

667
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,339
make sure that it's always the same

668
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,380
every single time but that's a bigger

669
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:56,759
conversation that I think the European

670
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,500
Union needs to discuss you want

671
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:00,000
sustainable practices but you also want

672
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,140
super consistent products so how are we

673
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,640
going to find ways to meet in the middle

674
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,620
or how are we going to work with

675
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,880
different companies in the space to make

676
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:07,019
more improvements along those lines

677
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,280
because we all want to be more

678
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:09,720
sustainable but we also have to meet

679
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:11,658
these very strict requirements that you

680
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,400
have for our cultivation and production

681
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:16,380
one area I'm seeing a lot of really cool

682
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,780
Innovations in which is the most

683
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:20,520
interesting area for me we spend so much

684
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:22,139
time in cultivation and then for me post

685
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,058
Harvest is always very fascinating

686
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,679
because I always tell people you can

687
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:27,480
spend 10 to 12 weeks on a crop and you

688
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,159
can ruin in a matter of days in a dry

689
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,620
room by you know having a mold

690
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:33,360
overgrowth or something else so that's

691
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:34,979
been a really big area of innovation and

692
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:36,658
I'll pass it over to the panel as well

693
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,339
to discuss a little bit about that but

694
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:40,380
one point I wanted to touch on was

695
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:43,019
microbial remediation which is a very

696
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,820
hot topic because coming from Canada we

697
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:46,558
use pretty much irradiation e-beaming

698
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:48,119
for everybody but you guys don't really

699
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:49,798
have as many options here and there's

700
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:51,479
not as many licenses available and

701
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,558
Europe's not a single country it's not

702
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,240
something you can easily move the

703
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:55,619
product Between Borders so I've been

704
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,179
seeing a lot of things on the floor and

705
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:58,379
some private conversations but I wanted

706
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:59,940
to know what

707
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,039
um you know your best guess is for the

708
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,778
next big wave of microbial remediation

709
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:05,879
technology in Europe

710
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:08,700
so that's a very good question

711
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,020
um it coming from Canada where as many

712
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,840
people know it's very strict in terms of

713
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:14,639
microbial standards and thresholds uh

714
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:16,740
first off it's definitely possible not

715
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,299
to have to remediate which is even

716
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,400
Meeting those tricks thresholds if

717
00:26:18,298 --> 00:26:22,019
you're growing let's say you're using an

718
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,159
inert media you have very highly

719
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:26,099
controlled environment with good air

720
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:29,400
filtration you have sanitary practices

721
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:31,379
if you do all those things it's very

722
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,778
possible and you can do it consistently

723
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,299
not having to remediate which

724
00:26:33,778 --> 00:26:37,859
there are so many remediation

725
00:26:36,298 --> 00:26:38,759
um methods out there and I'm not even

726
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:40,259
familiar with all of them there's

727
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:43,019
probably new ones that you guys know

728
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:46,379
that I haven't heard of but um e-beam

729
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:47,940
for example or or a radiation it has it

730
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,640
has an effect whether or not it's huge

731
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:53,519
on product quality uh and so and it also

732
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,140
has some stigma associated with it you

733
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:57,440
know there's radiation going into the

734
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,880
product so some buyers don't like that

735
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,519
or some consumers might not like that

736
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,020
idea and so it's possible to avoid it

737
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:05,700
all together with just the proper

738
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:07,200
practices it's

739
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,500
but I'd like to hear more about what

740
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,480
what's out there maybe um what I think

741
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,640
is really important that because in

742
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,980
cultivation we often talk about climate

743
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,659
you know and this discussion is

744
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,720
sometimes also happening in in the

745
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:22,919
drying phase it's like if you talk about

746
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,960
microclimates and so on is it really

747
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:26,940
understood how vertically my temperature

748
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,798
humidity Etc is

749
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:31,080
it's not really and it's also not

750
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:34,019
measured so the sensors are partly not

751
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:36,178
installed and I think as you said in in

752
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:38,819
the question there is so much potential

753
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:41,519
to make it right so give it the time it

754
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:43,619
needs have it under control I think um

755
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,740
there you not necessarily need really

756
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:48,538
high tech you need just sensors

757
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:51,120
dashboard look at it something out of

758
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:53,099
balance correct so it can can be pretty

759
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,739
easy as well but have it under control

760
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:58,019
and I think we always know

761
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,659
um you know a relatively High drying

762
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:03,119
rooms and if you go through the room you

763
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:05,340
feel already the differences and if we

764
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:07,619
feel it already then it's an issue for

765
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:09,298
sure so yeah yeah so I think I I would

766
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:10,798
agree with that is not I think there's a

767
00:28:09,298 --> 00:28:12,359
lot of different tools from a technology

768
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:13,019
standpoint

769
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:15,899
um

770
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:18,599
for reducing microbials but I think

771
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,980
really what it comes down to is your

772
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:21,899
climate your environment within that

773
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,700
room and I think there's a disconnect

774
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,000
that we see right now in terms of

775
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,620
people's strategy around sequencing of

776
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,019
climate set points within those dry

777
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:32,219
rooms during the drying period you know

778
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:34,740
personally I can't speak for everyone

779
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,558
but you know for myself the what I've

780
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:39,480
seen the most success in is touching the

781
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:42,298
plant as least as possible during that

782
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,339
harvesting into the dry room phase

783
00:28:42,298 --> 00:28:46,200
um and then it's really you need to be

784
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:48,178
very strategic in terms of your climate

785
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,159
within that room

786
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:52,860
um during really the first three to four

787
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,778
days are the most critical and there's

788
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:57,599
there's a big misconception around

789
00:28:54,778 --> 00:28:59,400
moisture content and water activity and

790
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:02,038
those are two very very important things

791
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,620
they come from really the food industry

792
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:07,319
around drying foods and microbials and

793
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:09,719
foods but they they hold very very true

794
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:11,819
to cannabis so that's what I would say

795
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,980
that is the biggest the two biggest

796
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:15,720
things is focusing on climate sequencing

797
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,099
on those first three to four days within

798
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,720
the room how much moisture are you

799
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:20,939
ripping out of that out of the product

800
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,860
to having the least amount of touches on

801
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,600
it and then understanding water activity

802
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:28,079
how does water actually move within this

803
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:31,558
product during that drying phase I to

804
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:35,220
add to that I think that even

805
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:36,599
we don't read for post-harvest

806
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,759
for example

807
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:40,079
for me was fascinating when I started in

808
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:43,859
cannabis and suddenly it's like okay

809
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:46,980
let's Harvest and I started seeing the

810
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:49,979
methods of hang dry for example

811
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:52,798
this plant is not uniform at all

812
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:55,079
you have small flowers big flowers even

813
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:57,538
bigger flowers all hanging on the same

814
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:59,398
plant plants on top of plants we have

815
00:29:57,538 --> 00:30:01,740
we've seen methods of people even

816
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:04,739
pushing plants on top of plants to dry

817
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,700
them all and just all of this is a

818
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,980
problem

819
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,919
just the basic techniques is a problem

820
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:13,940
and then for me in an innovation is

821
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:17,580
really asking these questions of how can

822
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:20,700
for this type of methods what are the

823
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:23,038
best plants to do with this method if

824
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,798
you have a crop where you have this

825
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:28,079
discrepancy of flowers you will always

826
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:30,720
have problems no matter how even good

827
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:32,398
your climate is probably because some of

828
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,558
these flowers are already dry and the

829
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:37,500
other ones are still with moisture and

830
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:39,418
it is a big challenge I I for example I

831
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,480
work with plants for years and I find

832
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:44,820
Cannabis I post Harvest like that very

833
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,819
challenging it's very challenging

834
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:49,980
we with all the techniques of not

835
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:53,700
touching and so on just the unique

836
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:55,620
aspect of dry hanging is a challenge and

837
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,019
this is actually a challenge that I find

838
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:59,939
very specific to cannabis

839
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:02,278
because in many fruits and in many

840
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,679
vegetables you you actually chop it

841
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:07,440
apart or you put the fruits separate and

842
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:10,200
so on and suddenly in many aspects of it

843
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,840
kind of doesn't do that and for that

844
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,000
aspect is unique I find that this

845
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:18,000
challenge to how can we improve on this

846
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,159
for this particular method is

847
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,200
something that not that many people are

848
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,960
looking at because it's very unique to

849
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,880
uh to cannabis and and I I find that a

850
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,919
interesting challenge

851
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,659
but also not the cheapest one to go at

852
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:35,100
this point to be honest is is

853
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:38,520
research and development in cannabis is

854
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:40,019
expensive if you look to the drying

855
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:42,359
methods it's also depending on what

856
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:45,058
Market are you serving are you going for

857
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:46,439
dry flour or is your Market extract yeah

858
00:31:45,058 --> 00:31:47,879
then it becomes a completely different

859
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,278
ballgame of course and you know all

860
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,419
about it of course

861
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:53,460
um I think that's what is really

862
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:55,259
interesting about cannabis so

863
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,538
um coming from agriculture previously

864
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:59,460
and one of the jobs I had before I

865
00:31:57,538 --> 00:32:01,379
started Consulting I managed a 1 million

866
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:04,200
square foot cannabis Greenhouse that is

867
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:07,080
a very unique situation your 36 000

868
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,519
plant Harvest your 2 500 kilos pumping

869
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:11,278
through a post-harvest process in six

870
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:13,679
days it's a lot and it's very difficult

871
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:16,500
for you to and you know we're partially

872
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:19,080
owned by a vegetable grower a very large

873
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,880
one and I always remember him really

874
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:22,079
focusing on cultivation being the most

875
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,220
important part of this process because

876
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:25,019
that's what they're used to their post

877
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,399
Harvest is pull it down wash it and put

878
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:27,839
it into a container that's all they do

879
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:29,219
and they weren't understanding why we

880
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:31,259
had to have so much labor and so much

881
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,460
time in this part and that you know if I

882
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:33,898
was actually strapped for labor during

883
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,819
covet I was putting them more in

884
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:37,619
post-harvest and in cultivation for me

885
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:39,058
missing a small step in cultivation was

886
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:40,619
way better than having a bunch of

887
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:43,019
product I couldn't dry down because we

888
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:44,759
couldn't bring it down in time so we're

889
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:47,158
able to take a lot of Innovations from

890
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:49,079
uh you know the agriculture industry for

891
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:50,520
cultivation but not so many for post

892
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:52,619
Harvest because it's so unique to

893
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:55,139
cannabis and the Cannabis product itself

894
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:56,699
is really heavily Reliant upon standards

895
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,919
that were set in the Legacy Market as to

896
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,840
what is considered good bud or top Cola

897
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:02,640
explaining to pharmaceutical Auditors

898
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:03,959
that the bigger buds are more desirable

899
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,700
even though they have the same trichome

900
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,140
density and effect as the smaller buds

901
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,120
is a very complicated thing to explain

902
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,620
but it's because regardless of the fact

903
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:13,319
that we're a medical Market we come from

904
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:14,459
a very long-standing Legacy Market I

905
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:16,079
want to thank everybody for all your

906
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,460
contributions today and the great panel

907
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:18,778
I just want to leave the last couple of

908
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,880
minutes in case anybody has any

909
00:33:18,778 --> 00:33:24,058
questions for anyone on the panel

910
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,420
let's hear it again for uh Tia and

911
00:33:24,058 --> 00:33:27,418
everybody

912
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:29,100
[Applause]

913
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:30,659
are there questions

914
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:32,939
Michael's running like you see someone

915
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:35,220
holding there you go all right

916
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:38,759
all right I'm Rocky petrulo with a

917
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:41,220
Colombian grow operation and tissue

918
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:44,339
culture you talked about earlier we're

919
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:45,538
we're trying to utilize that in our farm

920
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:48,298
in Columbia

921
00:33:45,538 --> 00:33:50,579
and there's a question that I've had for

922
00:33:48,298 --> 00:33:52,918
a while is that the DEA came out with

923
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:53,819
the seeds don't have THC so you can mail

924
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:57,559
them

925
00:33:53,819 --> 00:34:00,359
can you mail a plantlet in a test tube

926
00:33:57,558 --> 00:34:02,639
across borders across countries is that

927
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:04,319
possible it's going to depend on the

928
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,320
regulations if you want to send it to

929
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:08,460
the Netherlands no tissue is a plant a

930
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:11,878
seed

931
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:14,699
bear with us a seed is not a plant the

932
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:17,398
moment it has a tissue out of that seed

933
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:20,638
is a plant so tissue culture is a plant

934
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:23,039
in the Netherlands for example so it you

935
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,099
be very diligent on checking the

936
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,838
regulations of the country because some

937
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:29,000
countries might not consider tissue

938
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:32,519
culture

939
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,980
a plant and others will and if that

940
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:36,960
plant crosses all of those borders it

941
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:39,059
will be stuck on the country that

942
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,320
actually considers that plant so it

943
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:41,639
doesn't matter very very careful it

944
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,700
doesn't matter that it doesn't have any

945
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:46,440
THC it doesn't matter okay for example

946
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:47,878
speaking for the Dutch that I find

947
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,039
unique on that sense it's like it

948
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:52,199
doesn't matter at the THC level is a

949
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:53,759
plant cannabis tissue is a plant

950
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:56,460
therefore no

951
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,460
so yes be careful

952
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,460
yeah

953
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:04,079
do you know another country if these

954
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:06,000
rules function the same as in the levels

955
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,799
I think it depends on the hands of the

956
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,610
country yeah yeah you can just send it

957
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,019
to my house

958
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:12,019
[Laughter]

959
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:17,059
I'm a citizen of the world

960
00:35:19,858 --> 00:35:22,519
well you've taught them everything

961
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:26,820
apparently

962
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:28,259
what wait oh up there

963
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,700
go Michael let's hear it for Michael

964
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,540
canoes

965
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:34,199
walking all the stairs

966
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:36,719
[Applause]

967
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:39,000
hi my name is Christina I'm a cannabis

968
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,618
educator you were speaking about

969
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,219
sustainability

970
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:43,079
um

971
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:45,719
so I was wondering if you could comment

972
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:48,599
on growing in living soil and using

973
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:50,098
microbial inoculants for plant health I

974
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:52,740
know that would probably introduce more

975
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:54,599
variability but I just want to hear your

976
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:57,358
thoughts thank you

977
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:58,440
um yeah so I'm so my ironically enough

978
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:01,380
my background is actually in

979
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:05,099
regenerative AG so I was I was very much

980
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:07,140
a hippie in my upbringing but uh the

981
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:09,900
difficulty that I see both even coming

982
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:11,940
from regenerative AG into the Cannabis

983
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:14,579
industry is scalability

984
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:17,700
um that I think that you know living

985
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:22,280
soil is really it's a great solution to

986
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:25,919
a lot of things but it is very tough to

987
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,420
make them feasible at scale right and

988
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,639
um I think there's some hybrid systems

989
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,500
that we can find within there

990
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:34,500
um that can kind of meet that goal but

991
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,179
living soil at its foundation there's so

992
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,739
many benefits to it just at a commercial

993
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:42,139
scale it's very difficult to make

994
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:42,139
feasible yeah to add on that

995
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:47,460
the plants

996
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:48,838
have plant soil feedbacks they

997
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,000
communicate

998
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:53,099
top to bottom

999
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,639
scientifically scientifically that is a

1000
00:36:53,099 --> 00:37:00,180
thing nobody's denying that but we use

1001
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:02,759
Rock horse Cocos neutral systems for

1002
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:06,539
scalability nowadays Innovation is

1003
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:08,880
coming into that aspect of testing

1004
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:11,300
um even from the root side not only for

1005
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,500
example we have all biological control

1006
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:16,440
protocols that exist that function

1007
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:20,300
really really well many of these are

1008
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:23,880
techniques of animals and

1009
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:25,859
fungi's and insects that actually are

1010
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,838
interactions of the plant with their

1011
00:37:25,858 --> 00:37:30,119
system that we are bringing into the

1012
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:32,759
greenhouses into the indoor facilities

1013
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:34,920
to balance the system out

1014
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,200
there are very interesting Innovations

1015
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,838
in that field to bring even further on

1016
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:42,118
but that also takes time because we are

1017
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,739
talking about living beings interacting

1018
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:46,740
with each other and understanding how

1019
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:47,759
that it works in scale you will see

1020
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:49,739
often

1021
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,260
scientific papers coming with a new

1022
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:54,539
technique with a new aspect of it that

1023
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:56,339
they say it works very well there's a

1024
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:58,440
positive feedback that the plants will

1025
00:37:56,338 --> 00:38:00,299
grow x amount

1026
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,679
please bear in mind that that was done

1027
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,000
in a scientific

1028
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:05,819
system

1029
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,679
small areas highly controlled to

1030
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:10,320
actually understand the mechanism of it

1031
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:12,899
and then that needs a scalability and

1032
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:16,079
that is the where we are at with many of

1033
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:18,599
these we have biostimulants coming many

1034
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,700
of them that are coming into the market

1035
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:23,519
if they are coming to Summer feel free

1036
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:25,379
to ask them what was tested and how did

1037
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:27,480
it scale up

1038
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:30,240
because then you will get the feeling of

1039
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,400
where it stands on the ma on on the

1040
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:35,039
market compared to the scale that you

1041
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,780
have some things work really well at the

1042
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:39,000
small scale but then at a larger scale

1043
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:41,940
it dilutes it just don't have capacity

1044
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,219
to keep it going on a large scale

1045
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:46,019
but on a small scale it works really

1046
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:48,179
well then if you have a small scale

1047
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:50,159
infrastructure then it might be a good

1048
00:38:48,179 --> 00:38:52,858
solution for you if you have hectors of

1049
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:55,879
it might not it's not that it doesn't

1050
00:38:52,858 --> 00:38:58,319
work it's just that it's not scalable so

1051
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,780
measure the solutions to the scale that

1052
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,680
you're working at yeah I would suggest

1053
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,680
that but yes

1054
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:07,500
thank you let's hear it once again we're

1055
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,260
out of time unfortunately that was

1056
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:14,358
fantastic TF rules the entire crew

1057
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,359
