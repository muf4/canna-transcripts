1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:10,190
so we're gonna be talking about

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:11,690
regulations today if you if you're

3
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:14,869
familiar with Vancouver you'll know that

4
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:17,750
it's a bit of a maybe a word I can't use

5
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:18,980
on stage it's a bit of a mess in terms

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,509
of regulations and it's a good thing

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,399
we've got John here to help us go over

8
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:25,189
that so John I'm gonna kick it off by

9
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:27,289
asking you what is the legislative

10
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:29,629
framework and role of the provinces

11
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:31,988
local governments and other bodies such

12
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:37,039
as the BC Agricultural Land Commission

13
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:40,520
since legalization in October 2018 thank

14
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:42,649
you I think we have 23 different

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,540
countries here so it's we thought it

16
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:46,280
would be useful to sort of give you the

17
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:51,469
different framework that exists in

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:53,750
Canada but after listening to Laurie I'm

19
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:56,988
reminded of the family motto which is

20
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:59,769
history cannot be denied and we

21
00:00:56,988 --> 00:01:03,199
obviously have history repeating itself

22
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:06,228
just as what happened with alcohol the

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,118
bottom line being local governments are

24
00:01:06,228 --> 00:01:11,149
the the problem that you have to

25
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:13,989
overcome in order to get the the market

26
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:17,599
to really take off anyway in Canada

27
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:20,509
criminal law is a federal power unlike

28
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:22,009
the US and so that explains a bit of a

29
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:25,579
difference why you've got all your

30
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:27,468
states now making it legal historically

31
00:01:25,578 --> 00:01:29,388
you had all your state's making it

32
00:01:27,468 --> 00:01:32,449
illegal before your federal government

33
00:01:29,388 --> 00:01:34,998
and now it's unwinding so the criminal

34
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:39,649
law power is federal and what we've done

35
00:01:34,998 --> 00:01:43,608
here is we have legalized a little bit

36
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:45,590
we have decriminalized a little bit with

37
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:48,618
a ticketing scheme that kicks in after

38
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:51,109
the legal part and we have kept in an

39
00:01:48,618 --> 00:01:52,608
awful lot of criminal law so the

40
00:01:51,108 --> 00:01:55,068
cannabis Act and the cannabis

41
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:57,589
regulations are still criminal law the

42
00:01:55,069 --> 00:02:01,009
federal government says it's still using

43
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:04,310
the criminal law and it has allowed the

44
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:08,618
provinces to be involved in distribution

45
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:10,939
so production various rules to do with

46
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:13,579
promotion and advertising and all of

47
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:15,709
that as as was mentioned earlier taken

48
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:17,090
from the tobacco industry is controlled

49
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:19,629
federally

50
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:23,450
the province now controls distribution

51
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:25,789
and so that's the dispensaries and as

52
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:28,818
you may know from a certain case where

53
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:31,609
her lady allowed the people to come to a

54
00:02:28,818 --> 00:02:34,699
garden party the police three plants in

55
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,739
public view was in realistic rate that's

56
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:39,848
right you're not allowed to do that so

57
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:44,840
but then you've got local government and

58
00:02:39,848 --> 00:02:48,979
so not only towns cities municipalities

59
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:52,340
of course zoning licensing all of these

60
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:54,409
sorts of things but also we have the

61
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,890
agricultural land commission for example

62
00:02:54,409 --> 00:03:00,019
which is a provincial body that recently

63
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:02,539
said we don't want to be involved in

64
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:05,360
applications for people wanting to grow

65
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:07,209
cannabis any more it's a designated farm

66
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,310
use if you're in the negra cultural area

67
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:14,959
so we're going to pass to the local

68
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:18,560
governments the power to decide various

69
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:21,949
questions about whether you can do what

70
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,459
you want to do because now you can only

71
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:27,530
grow in soil for example since last July

72
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:30,739
if you've got a building in the

73
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:33,379
agricultural land reserve already fine

74
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:35,359
you can produce inside that building but

75
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:40,579
if you don't you can only do it in soil

76
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:43,069
and so greenhouses are going to be the

77
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:45,650
way that people will be able to do it so

78
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:48,009
then you'll have a place like Richmond

79
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,870
BC where the airport is which will say

80
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:53,929
we're very jealous about our industrial

81
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:55,310
uses so you can't do it in an industrial

82
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,650
area you have to do it in an

83
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:00,319
agricultural area so you have all of

84
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:03,620
these conflicting positions being taken

85
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:07,219
by either different bodies or local

86
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,599
governments and to do whatever you want

87
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:10,909
to do in the cannabis scene you're going

88
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:13,579
to have to a give notice to local

89
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:16,668
governments and get their permission or

90
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:20,780
approval or support so just like in the

91
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:23,689
old alcohol days we have wet areas and

92
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:26,598
we have dry areas and it's going to take

93
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:28,848
some time in order to get them to move

94
00:04:26,598 --> 00:04:30,678
along in Abbotsford where I am there

95
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:33,079
and where I live in mission it's like a

96
00:04:30,678 --> 00:04:35,388
wait-and-see even though we've had

97
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:37,778
people involved in the industry in and

98
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:41,509
around the area for an awful long time

99
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:43,749
so that's the basic framework I could

100
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:47,149
obviously get into a lot more detail but

101
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:49,219
well thanks for explaining that John you

102
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:50,928
know given given all of that I imagine

103
00:04:49,218 --> 00:04:52,728
and I know for a fact you know British

104
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:55,428
Columbia Vancouver in particular has

105
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:58,308
been a pretty important place when it

106
00:04:55,428 --> 00:05:00,019
comes to recognizing you know medical

107
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:02,719
need for cannabis so my next question is

108
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:05,688
for dorri dorri in what ways has

109
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:07,129
legalization impacted your medical

110
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:09,439
customers it should be on already I

111
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:21,338
think at the dispensary you managed

112
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:23,509
downtown well the customers are being

113
00:05:21,338 --> 00:05:25,459
largely ignored by the government

114
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:27,379
program while they take this

115
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:32,990
wait-and-see attitude and they'll review

116
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:37,369
it in a few years because so many stores

117
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:41,110
have been closed down in such quick ways

118
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:44,119
without any contingency plans whatsoever

119
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:46,519
they're getting to meet a lot more sick

120
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:51,379
people while they wait in line for their

121
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:53,749
medicine which is a problem for sick

122
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:56,718
people because one of the reasons we

123
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:59,149
wanted so many dispensaries open was so

124
00:05:56,718 --> 00:06:03,288
that people would be able to get quickly

125
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:06,168
served and have time with their their

126
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:11,118
dispenser and that's being taken away

127
00:06:06,168 --> 00:06:13,338
from them they are being told that they

128
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:17,449
can just get their needs met at a legal

129
00:06:13,338 --> 00:06:20,689
store and yet if we ask Andrew what's

130
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:24,259
allowed on his shelf today compared to

131
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:29,028
what was allowed or what he had on his

132
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:31,278
shelves before it would be largely

133
00:06:29,028 --> 00:06:33,769
different and people's needs aren't

134
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:35,598
being that they're not able to get the

135
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:38,420
lotions and creams in the manner that

136
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:43,289
they got them before and

137
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:46,470
and the prices are not affordable for

138
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:50,520
the kind of people that I serve in my

139
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:54,110
dispensary Andrews not allowed to have a

140
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:57,779
dispensary so don't call it that it's a

141
00:06:54,110 --> 00:07:02,610
it's a a you know a cannabis retail

142
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:05,159
outlet though dispensing goes on behind

143
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,759
those doors it's not allowed to be

144
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,240
called that

145
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,980
so there's no compassion allowed to be

146
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,530
you know though they have it in their

147
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:17,790
hearts they're not allowed to serve it

148
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:19,889
in their store and and that's that's the

149
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,900
part that that people are fearing for

150
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:24,810
right now is who's going to take care of

151
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:27,870
them where are they going to be able to

152
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,490
go and get the cookies and the lotion

153
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:33,060
and a little bit of love that they're

154
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:35,460
looking for every day because it's not

155
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:39,120
just about weed on the shelves it's

156
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:40,469
about love and caring that also happens

157
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:46,769
with these people while they're getting

158
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:49,560
their medicine so thanks story 100% so

159
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:52,099
Gordon or Andrew part of me Andrew

160
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,740
you're on the other side of things and

161
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,270
I'd like to know yeah I have haven't

162
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,889
gone through the transition and

163
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,879
receiving your license to operate in

164
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:02,219
Vancouver what are some of the

165
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,569
opportunities you see for chiaro and

166
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,970
other legal retailers in British

167
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:08,659
Columbia yeah thank you thank you and

168
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:12,030
everyone this morning you know

169
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,590
opportunity abounds we're really at the

170
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:14,759
ground level here and we can really go

171
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:16,289
up from here I mean if you're watching

172
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,879
the numbers at all

173
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,050
you know British Columbia with 19

174
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,540
million dollars in sales since

175
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,639
legalization is a figure that should

176
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,870
really draw a lot of attention to really

177
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,449
the issue at hand here

178
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:29,850
you know Dorie speaks to you know well

179
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:32,370
established an entrenched medical market

180
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:34,379
here that has expectations and needs and

181
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,820
you know the current regime isn't

182
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:37,169
serving those needs we're in a period of

183
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,660
transition we have to acknowledge that

184
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:41,849
as well you know it takes patience and

185
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:45,059
perseverance and sacrifice to move

186
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:46,769
through this transition area fees I

187
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:48,719
think about it as myself as a medical

188
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:50,740
patient and the situation people are put

189
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,110
in and you know I have pts

190
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,669
see and I'm I recall just serving so

191
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,289
many people that you know had conditions

192
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:58,870
and illnesses where this was their only

193
00:08:56,289 --> 00:09:01,599
option so my heart goes out to them I I

194
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:04,000
am encouraged every day though by the

195
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,769
amazing people not only in this room but

196
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,110
in our community and and around the

197
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:09,939
world that are pushing hard for cannabis

198
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,278
you know we owe it to them to get this

199
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,529
right and I'm incredibly encouraged by

200
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:15,970
the fact that we have done it before and

201
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:19,629
we will do it again

202
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:20,889
and I brought I was you know thinking

203
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:23,019
about this question Amanda and I brought

204
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:24,490
a poem by Richard Kipling called if and

205
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:27,220
I'm just gonna read a small segment of

206
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:29,320
it and I find it incredibly inspiring

207
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,450
because this is so poignant to where we

208
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:35,440
are today if you can keep your head

209
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,850
about you if you can keep your head when

210
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,950
all about you are losing theirs and

211
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,440
blaming it on you if you can trust

212
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:44,200
yourself when all men doubt you but make

213
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,680
allowance for their doubting too if you

214
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,009
can wait and not be tired of waiting or

215
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:53,528
being lied about and don't deal in lies

216
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:56,679
or being hated don't give way to hating

217
00:09:53,528 --> 00:09:59,740
and yet don't look too good nor talk too

218
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:01,719
wise if you can dream and not make

219
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,028
dreams your master if you can think and

220
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,310
not make thoughts your aim if you can

221
00:10:04,028 --> 00:10:08,429
meet with triumph and disaster and treat

222
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:10,689
with those two Impostors just the same

223
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:12,069
and this is an important line here and

224
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:14,950
this is what really struck me to share

225
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:17,230
this today is if you can bear to hear

226
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:20,620
the truth you've spoken twisted by

227
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:22,480
knaves to make traps for fools or watch

228
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:25,509
the things you gave your life to broken

229
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,480
and stoop down and build them up with

230
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:32,200
worn-out tools and I think about that

231
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,420
then I think about dory I think about

232
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,209
John and I think about the patients in

233
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:38,919
this community that I can't have that

234
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:41,559
conversation with anymore and it hurts a

235
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:44,259
lot every day and I talk to our retail

236
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:46,028
staff about this and I go you know we're

237
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:48,129
still empowered we can still be

238
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:51,429
inspiring we can still connect with

239
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:52,929
people provide solutions you know Adam

240
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:54,549
Green black came up with this great line

241
00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:57,069
of the last lift conference he talked

242
00:10:54,549 --> 00:10:58,990
about creative compliance and that's

243
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,278
what I'm pushing towards at chiaro and

244
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,778
that's what I'm pushing towards in my

245
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:03,879
work with akers the association of

246
00:11:01,778 --> 00:11:06,939
Canadian cannabis retailers

247
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:09,759
reuniting we're invigorating we're we're

248
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:11,260
bringing this this train home again and

249
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,149
it's gonna take some time it's not

250
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:15,899
perfect this is a process and it sucks

251
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:18,789
most of the time to be frank with you

252
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:20,919
you know to see what you've built broken

253
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:22,750
and have to stoop down to stoop after

254
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:26,829
all we've built and sacrificed and

255
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:29,950
proven right that is probably the most

256
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:31,570
tragic part of it all but again I'll

257
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,990
incredibly encourage we've done it

258
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,120
before

259
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,799
we can do it again we're gonna continue

260
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,389
to do it you know we're building strong

261
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:39,039
relationships with our supply chain that

262
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:41,350
are gonna be responsive to this need

263
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,389
we're holding the government accountable

264
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,190
we're continuing to advocate this

265
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:47,199
message isn't being lost for those of us

266
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:49,800
who have transitioned I know they're

267
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,910
working hard you know again extensively

268
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,740
they can't always share all the

269
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:56,139
information they want to but the power

270
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,610
of anecdote the power of research the

271
00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:00,879
greatest victim of prohibition is now

272
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:04,269
coming to light you know the power of

273
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:06,129
this room I'm incredibly encouraged so

274
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:16,629
thank you so much for your honesty and

275
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:19,269
for that I might need a second so my

276
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:21,129
next question is for John John can you

277
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:23,350
tell us about a specific appeal in

278
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:24,490
Vancouver involving Karuna health some

279
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,860
people in the room might know the name

280
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,600
and the way that dispensary sort of fits

281
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,669
it to Vancouver bylaws how does this

282
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,100
intersect with the constitutional

283
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:34,959
question of reasonable access for

284
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,300
medical patients well I should have

285
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,460
mentioned in the opening the federal

286
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:43,029
government has kept control over medical

287
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,920
and so while health constitutionally is

288
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:48,579
a divided field between the feds and the

289
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:50,740
provinces they've kept control so we I

290
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:54,220
incorporated the BC compassion Club

291
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:59,590
Society I was 1997 so more than 20 years

292
00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:01,480
ago they had rave reviews from all of

293
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:03,460
the task force's and everybody that's

294
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,039
ever looked into it and holding it up as

295
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,720
a good model and then of course the

296
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:10,209
federal government came along it didn't

297
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,259
provide for Medical dispensaries in the

298
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:17,129
cannabis act or regulations and so there

299
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:20,580
is going to be another court case

300
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:22,740
that seeks to declare that a genuine

301
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,350
Medical dispensaries compassion clubs

302
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:28,159
are part of reasonable access you should

303
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:31,589
understand that here in Canada the

304
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:33,360
Constitution provides in Section seven

305
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:37,170
that you have the right to life liberty

306
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:40,019
and the security of your person and the

307
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:41,610
right not to be deprived thereof except

308
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:44,689
in accordance with something called the

309
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:48,600
principles of fundamental justice and

310
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:50,130
the court first way way back in 2001 the

311
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,629
Ontario Court of Appeal and more

312
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:55,019
recently the federal court trial

313
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:57,000
division and a lard confirmed that the

314
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:59,789
federal government has to provide

315
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,089
medical exemptions for medically

316
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:05,099
approved patients to prevent the

317
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:07,830
violation of the security of their

318
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,209
person having established that what they

319
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:11,820
did in the past was to do that

320
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:13,969
arbitrarily which is country to

321
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,290
principles of fundamental justice so

322
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:18,570
constitutional rights are involved when

323
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:19,469
it comes to medical so the city of

324
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:22,770
Vancouver

325
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:27,149
much to its credit passed by laws to

326
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:31,889
enable Medical dispensaries among others

327
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:35,039
and but some of them weren't able to

328
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:37,439
meet the rules such as being 300 metres

329
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,240
from the nearest school thing another

330
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,970
compassion club or dispensary these

331
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,360
sorts of rules and so ultimately an

332
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:47,430
injunction was brought to shut them down

333
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:50,459
so again I credit the City of Vancouver

334
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:52,109
for unlike Toronto using the police

335
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:54,509
right at the outset to shut everybody

336
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:56,820
down and using the civil process here

337
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:59,490
instead of the police to have the issues

338
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:02,820
resolved in a civil manner but in any

339
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:04,409
event these were the the ones that

340
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,209
couldn't meet the requirements of the

341
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:07,588
bylaws called themselves Medical

342
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:10,379
dispensaries and interestingly the

343
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:13,079
government didn't challenge that so it

344
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:17,039
went to court and we counter petitioned

345
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:21,000
to say that they were part of reasonable

346
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:23,399
access and we had a patient we had a

347
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,070
patient running a club we got standing

348
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:26,970
we did the full argument and everything

349
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:30,120
and then

350
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:32,730
the judge decided not to decide the

351
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,950
constitutional question which we're

352
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:38,670
appealing and the appeal is set for

353
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:40,110
sometime in November I believe but

354
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:45,299
basically the court ruled that the

355
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:47,700
bylaws were valid and that these folks

356
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:50,549
had to comply with the bylaws and that

357
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,980
heaves it would be unwise is the way he

358
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:56,849
put it to decide the constitutional

359
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:58,680
question so there is a better way to to

360
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,450
handle that issue and that's going to be

361
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:03,209
another application in the federal court

362
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:08,009
trial division to seek that type of a

363
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:10,259
declaration and you've probably heard

364
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:12,330
something similar is going to occur with

365
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:14,129
respect to these limitations in terms of

366
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:16,740
ten milligrams and the edibles and the

367
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:19,500
extracts and so on because you know that

368
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,470
medical patients in Canada since the

369
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:26,179
Smith case had to saw is here somewhere

370
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:29,160
was the main council established that

371
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:31,409
medical patients are entitled to possess

372
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:35,069
cannabis in any of its forms they're not

373
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:37,860
limited to dried cannabis but they have

374
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:40,100
to make it themselves and so again many

375
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:43,110
of them have been waiting for these

376
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:46,019
dispensaries to be able to provide them

377
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:47,820
with high-end extracts and so on that

378
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:49,379
they require for their medical condition

379
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:52,170
but the government in its

380
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:55,740
shortsightedness is worried about novice

381
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:58,740
users consuming too much or accidentally

382
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:01,049
taking too much as opposed to giving

383
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,639
priority to prevent the violation of the

384
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:05,039
constitutional rights of medical

385
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,338
patients to ensure that they get what

386
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:14,129
they need in order to in some cases

387
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:17,578
survive and so basically the Karuna

388
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:19,470
appeal is there I'm not optimistic that

389
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,970
the court of appeal is necessarily going

390
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,650
to grab the issue so we're probably

391
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:25,019
going to have to relitigate it in

392
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:27,240
federal court along with the extracts

393
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:29,279
issue thanks John that's a really nice

394
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,829
way to segue into my next question for

395
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:34,369
dory so some of you in the audience may

396
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:36,119
know that on October 17th of this year

397
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:37,919
regulations in Canada are going to

398
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:39,899
change so that we can have edibles

399
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:43,170
extracts and topicals

400
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:45,540
run into the mix so Dori

401
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:49,380
given those new regulations how do you

402
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:51,149
foresee them you know you know the the

403
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,790
regulations on the recreational market

404
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:55,640
part of me impacting medical users and

405
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:57,960
consumers overall I see you're

406
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:03,930
unwrapping some goodies over there for

407
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:07,740
us well I am I understand that

408
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:10,950
everybody's use of cannabis is different

409
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:14,160
and everybody has different needs I also

410
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:17,370
understand that we all learn in a

411
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,779
different way too and so I wanted to do

412
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:22,619
something that was just a little bit

413
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:25,109
visual to help you understand this

414
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:32,389
concept so I'm going to make the case

415
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:37,139
for and against ten milligram cookies so

416
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:43,020
if we have all of our cookies have to be

417
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:45,480
10 milligrams and I need 200 milligrams

418
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:50,279
this is how many cookies I'm going to

419
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:54,559
need to eat at once that's a lot of

420
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:58,940
cookies say this is 2300 calories in

421
00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:02,129
cookies they're 130 calories each

422
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:08,820
where's the room for broccoli if we're

423
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:12,450
just eating cookies like this so the

424
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:15,149
issues that I see are all this excess

425
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:21,539
packaging we already know that that's an

426
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:23,550
issue I see obesity diabetes and a host

427
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:26,789
of other medical problems that go along

428
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:30,869
with expecting people to eat all this

429
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:33,680
sugar chocolate flour all the other

430
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:36,750
ingredients that go along with this too

431
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:41,549
to get somebody up to a 200 milligram

432
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:46,140
dose so I said I would make a foreign

433
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:49,799
against if all of our cookies were 200

434
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:52,590
milligrams and we have the lightweights

435
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:54,619
we would need to be serving pieces of

436
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:57,869
cookie

437
00:19:54,619 --> 00:20:02,849
this is one cookie cut up into 20 pieces

438
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:04,678
this morning this can be satisfying for

439
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:08,339
somebody that's on a diet and only needs

440
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:10,140
the 10 milligrams but it's not it's just

441
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:14,908
not a reasonable way to have people pack

442
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:17,070
their cookies around so it's okay to

443
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:19,380
have a 10 milligram cookie clearly

444
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:21,928
labeled but I think it's okay to have a

445
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:24,900
200 milligram cookie clearly labeled

446
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:32,669
just like a 500 milligram cookie clearly

447
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:35,970
labeled so I I hope that before October

448
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:38,820
17th comes along that people start to

449
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:41,970
really contemplate what this 10

450
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:44,849
milligram dosage is gonna cause because

451
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:48,569
this isn't just a medicinal problem this

452
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:51,089
is a recreational problem as well some

453
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:52,558
people five milligrams they only need

454
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:54,269
this and they're going to be high all

455
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:56,519
day long

456
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:59,339
some people would need to eat five times

457
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:02,788
that in a day to even start to feel it

458
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:05,220
so let's not cause another health

459
00:21:02,788 --> 00:21:13,200
problem while we're trying to save

460
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:16,798
people from cannabis for that

461
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,500
show-and-tell it's very effective my

462
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:21,538
next question is for Andrew obviously

463
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,720
you know consumers in Vancouver we're

464
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:26,700
pretty spoiled and you know we're used

465
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,548
to being able to access a wide variety

466
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:31,679
of strains of products

467
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:33,029
how can regulated retailers compete

468
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,460
against the entrenched market in

469
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:37,829
Vancouver yeah that's a it's a great an

470
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:41,519
important question the short answer is

471
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:43,439
we can't flat out they have better

472
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,599
quality better variety they have a

473
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,340
consumer base that knows who they are

474
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:51,000
our [ __ ] waited in that transaction

475
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:53,069
process so you know I'm not trying to

476
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,509
compete against the illicit market you

477
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:55,798
know that's a that's a natural

478
00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:58,288
progression that'll happen over time

479
00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:59,940
when you start you know looking at some

480
00:21:58,288 --> 00:22:02,730
of the established markets in the States

481
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,830
this takes five seven years to start to

482
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:06,899
see that erosion and

483
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:08,579
to happen through transition and it has

484
00:22:06,898 --> 00:22:10,408
to happen through integration so that's

485
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:12,750
what I try and focus on as a retailer

486
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:14,549
I want that market in our market

487
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,798
providing products and building

488
00:22:14,548 --> 00:22:18,658
solutions and helping with the dialogue

489
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:20,429
and moving the needle on key social

490
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:21,870
issues because they've been doing it the

491
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:23,820
longest and if we don't get that

492
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:26,038
intellectual talent and that human

493
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:27,960
capital into the cannabis pool in the

494
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:30,028
regulated environment then it's gonna be

495
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,649
a pretty insipid pool and it's not gonna

496
00:22:30,028 --> 00:22:33,720
be you know meeting the needs of

497
00:22:31,648 --> 00:22:36,058
consumers so I don't try and compete

498
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,860
against that I try and integrate I serve

499
00:22:36,058 --> 00:22:40,138
as a director of acres and and we really

500
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:42,209
work to advocate and lobby government on

501
00:22:40,138 --> 00:22:44,369
important issues to help integrate the

502
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:46,079
legacy market into the regulated

503
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:47,969
environment and that is a vital mission

504
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,038
that over the next three to five years

505
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:51,600
is going to take a concerted effort of

506
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:53,700
all of us in this room and all of us in

507
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,589
this country and community to really

508
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,500
push for because you know these people

509
00:22:55,589 --> 00:23:00,509
helped build the opportunity we have and

510
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,130
if we're not responsive to that a just

511
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:04,859
because you know we need the talent and

512
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:06,330
B because it's really owed if you know

513
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:08,668
through this process of legalization to

514
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:10,019
help get people through and you know as

515
00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:12,389
someone who has transitioned

516
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:15,359
successfully you know I want to use that

517
00:23:12,388 --> 00:23:17,519
open door to to bring others with me and

518
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:19,949
to really build positive and purpose

519
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,808
purpose momentum behind that you know

520
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:24,000
there are larger existential threats in

521
00:23:21,808 --> 00:23:25,589
our industry and I would say and I know

522
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,538
the government you know is working hard

523
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:31,079
and I have empathy for regulators but

524
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:32,940
you know the BC LDB is actually more on

525
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:34,470
my radar for competition than the

526
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,570
illicit market is to be honest with you

527
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,919
they don't have a cap on the number of

528
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:39,629
stores that they can have in British

529
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:44,370
Columbia they can pay their frontline

530
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:47,309
staff $30 an hour they can do revenue

531
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:49,229
sharing with communities those are

532
00:23:47,308 --> 00:23:50,579
distinctive advantages that if you're a

533
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,079
community that's sitting on the fence

534
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:55,558
about cannabis I mean that's a much

535
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:56,579
safer more ostensibly stable option to

536
00:23:55,558 --> 00:23:58,168
choose from and we're seeing that

537
00:23:56,579 --> 00:24:01,109
starting to happen in communities across

538
00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:03,450
the GBR d so for me I'm focused on on

539
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:06,058
those things and on the regulations

540
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:07,380
themselves I mean you know I try and

541
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:08,879
compliment Minister farm worth when I

542
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,620
see him about the progression we're

543
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,419
seeing with the LCR be and you know

544
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:15,808
applications are starting to get through

545
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:16,070
we got 63 license we got 68 in AIP we

546
00:24:15,808 --> 00:24:18,859
got

547
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:20,450
300 or more under community review so

548
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:21,829
those are encouraging numbers were way

549
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:26,150
behind but we're getting there but

550
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:28,549
window opacity I mean this is for me

551
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:30,500
like almost issue number one you look at

552
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:32,029
D stigmatizing and naturalizing and

553
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,410
integrating cannabis into the social

554
00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:35,240
context in a meaningful way

555
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:38,000
having opaque windows is not achieving

556
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,500
that at all and you know I look at you

557
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,269
know operators you know Jeff at Muse

558
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:44,180
people were walking by didn't even know

559
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:45,680
he was open that's tragic when you look

560
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:47,750
at the amount of investment and

561
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,180
infrastructure and training that goes

562
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:52,730
into building a regulated retail store

563
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:55,070
in Canada it's a tremendously daunting

564
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:57,349
experience so you know again for me I'm

565
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:58,549
looking at the BC LD be actually more

566
00:24:57,349 --> 00:25:00,980
than I'm looking at the illicit market

567
00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:03,799
it factors in obviously when you look at

568
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:05,779
you know online there's a big big market

569
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:07,639
there and you know we operate in two

570
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:10,430
provinces and Saskatchewan we have shops

571
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,650
in Saskatoon and in l'orange and an

572
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:14,630
online sales there are pretty dismal and

573
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,769
that's the kind of you know word on the

574
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,540
street with most of the operators

575
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:18,769
because again everyone's getting what

576
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:20,299
they need online they're getting the

577
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:21,920
topicals they're getting the edibles

578
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:24,049
things they really really want and need

579
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,160
I'm excited about the Phase two products

580
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:27,529
coming in because that's gonna make a

581
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,990
big shift create a big opportunity for

582
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:31,160
the regulated retailers to help meet

583
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:34,039
some of that market need and help that

584
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,570
market transition over I'm concerned

585
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:37,069
that it's gonna be the same dynamic out

586
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:38,960
the gate that it was with flour and oil

587
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:40,700
where it's not gonna be great out the

588
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,220
gate it's gonna be a lot of challenges

589
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,529
and an uncertainty on the supply chain

590
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,730
in terms of consistency but you know

591
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:48,500
we're gonna get there we're gonna keep

592
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:51,049
pushing keep advocating this is not

593
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,579
perfect it is a process and we have to

594
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,409
keep our stakeholders engaged and

595
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:56,240
educated on that and so you know we

596
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:57,680
really work at chiaro to keep that

597
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,289
conversation moving forward in a

598
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,310
positive purposeful direction you know I

599
00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:03,889
don't want to whine and complain

600
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:05,539
aimlessly we really have to focus on

601
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:07,820
what our needs are what our goals are

602
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:10,009
work to build a community and consensus

603
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:11,720
and cohesion around those and go get it

604
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:12,950
you know we've done it before we made

605
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,500
legalization happen

606
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:17,360
I mean I'm incredibly proud of that

607
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,890
being a part of that movement in that

608
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,319
momentum we got a long way to go

609
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:24,140
it is not perfect people are hurt people

610
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:25,579
are not getting their medicine and and

611
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:27,440
there is a huge entrenched market that's

612
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:28,889
not transitioning because they don't see

613
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,080
the opportunity yet

614
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:32,580
and so we got to advocate for them keep

615
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:34,019
you know pushing the needle on making

616
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:36,928
sure we're reducing those barriers to

617
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:38,429
entry creating more viable sustainable

618
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:40,710
business opportunities for them to see

619
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:41,850
in front of them and you know looking at

620
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:44,460
the regulated environment right now

621
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:46,289
that's a big challenge so again we just

622
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,880
got to stay positive and purposeful keep

623
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:50,700
pushing it and an offer that

624
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,020
personalized service to consumers you

625
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,090
know they'll keep coming back if they

626
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:56,339
start getting some rapport and

627
00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:58,439
relationship and so we're focused on

628
00:26:56,339 --> 00:27:00,480
really training our staff incredibly

629
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,980
well to build strong relationships at

630
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,690
the counter and that's gonna build the

631
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,220
rapport and the referrals we need to

632
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:07,169
weather the storm here in the next few

633
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,279
years awesome thank you I really

634
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:13,710
appreciate that point you made about

635
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:17,220
competing with the LDB definitely yep

636
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:19,019
so John another question for you we

637
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,759
touched a little bit on on creative

638
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:22,798
compliance now with the BC cannabis

639
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:25,529
control and Licensing Act doesn't apply

640
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:26,849
to medical cannabis but the definition

641
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:30,149
of a cannabis store in the Vancouver

642
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:31,769
bylaw includes a compassion Club what

643
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,780
should the compassion Club and Medical

644
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:37,889
dispensaries do in Vancouver to prevent

645
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:41,129
being shut down well as I think was

646
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:43,200
mentioned earlier the government here

647
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:47,370
clearly was hoping that medical would

648
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,539
disappear and go into the rec stores and

649
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:51,449
there wouldn't be any Medical

650
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:55,139
dispensaries that's clearly what they

651
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:58,650
intended the City of Vancouver again in

652
00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:00,690
putting its bylaw together created a

653
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,580
category that was a compassion Club and

654
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:05,190
so while some of the dispensaries have

655
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:07,109
been it was at 30,000 dollar fee the

656
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:09,808
compassion clubs only a thousand dollar

657
00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:12,479
fee and they also have a Wellness Center

658
00:28:09,808 --> 00:28:15,480
that goes with it and so on so again

659
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,970
Vancouver was foresight had foresight in

660
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,890
terms of the plan and what everybody

661
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:22,620
expected the feds would do originally

662
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:27,179
and provide for Medical dispensaries or

663
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:30,298
compassion clubs so the community safety

664
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:32,400
team is the group that is now from

665
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:34,440
various police agencies going around the

666
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,590
province trying to close people down if

667
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:39,600
you don't have an application going

668
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:40,949
through the provincial system for a Rec

669
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:42,418
license and they were telling

670
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:45,240
the compassion Club and others that's

671
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:46,620
what they should do if you've got your

672
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,929
application in it's my understanding

673
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:52,288
they'll leave you alone as it's going

674
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:56,730
through the process so bearing in mind

675
00:28:52,288 --> 00:28:59,669
that medical is still controlled by the

676
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:03,298
feds one of the licenses under the

677
00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:05,309
cannabis Act is a you know got a license

678
00:29:03,298 --> 00:29:07,470
to produce a license to process a

679
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:09,869
nursery license and so on one of them is

680
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:12,960
a license for sale and there's a

681
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:15,928
subclass license that's to sell for

682
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,429
medical purposes so my position has been

683
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:20,220
and I've taken this up with the

684
00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:22,528
Community Safety Team that the

685
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:27,829
compassion clubs and true Medical

686
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:30,778
dispensaries are not recreationally the

687
00:29:27,829 --> 00:29:33,199
provincial act expressly says so that

688
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:36,269
it's doesn't apply to medical cannabis

689
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,159
so I'm having them apply for a license

690
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:40,370
to sell for medical purposes and I'm

691
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:43,289
saying as long as they're in the process

692
00:29:40,369 --> 00:29:44,668
applying for their license to sell for

693
00:29:43,288 --> 00:29:47,548
medical purposes which they've been

694
00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:49,710
doing for the last 20 plus years you

695
00:29:47,548 --> 00:29:53,099
should also be leaving them alone and by

696
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:56,429
the way if you do go in there and try to

697
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:59,369
shut them down remember you're going to

698
00:29:56,429 --> 00:30:02,038
be interfering with the constitutional

699
00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:06,449
rights of medically approved patients

700
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:08,548
and they will have a remedy for the

701
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:12,360
violation of their constitutional rights

702
00:30:08,548 --> 00:30:14,668
if you do that so be it aware that

703
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:19,609
you're dealing with a different type of

704
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:22,500
entity now again the Vancouver bylaw

705
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:25,319
expressly has a definition of a cannabis

706
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,700
store interestingly enough in the Karuna

707
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:29,189
case they were trying to say that their

708
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,700
prior definitions simply allowed the

709
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:34,350
compassion club to be an advocate for

710
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:36,538
medical as opposed to actually providing

711
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:39,599
cannabis but the definition of a

712
00:30:36,538 --> 00:30:42,388
cannabis store now in the bylaw clearly

713
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:46,079
includes a compassion club interestingly

714
00:30:42,388 --> 00:30:49,079
enough and clearly makes it makes it

715
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:50,879
clear that you can sell cannabis for

716
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:53,250
in the case of a compassionate love for

717
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,670
medical purposes but we need to get that

718
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:59,240
federal license first so we do have a

719
00:30:55,670 --> 00:31:03,000
good argument I think here in Vancouver

720
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:05,849
to try and get the federal license in

721
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,130
order to get the city license as a

722
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:11,809
cannabis store but as a compassion Club

723
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:15,870
so that hopefully we'll see that develop

724
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:17,519
that's again if they turn us down we

725
00:31:15,869 --> 00:31:21,629
will be looking at the courts in order

726
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:23,400
to try and remedy the situation so it's

727
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,900
always encouraging to hear again from

728
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,850
Laurier Jax what you said about

729
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:29,070
California and I've heard this from

730
00:31:26,849 --> 00:31:32,009
others how they do prioritize the the

731
00:31:29,069 --> 00:31:34,109
medical in the stores and are able to to

732
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:36,059
run them both together here

733
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:37,439
unfortunately they've just left it as

734
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:42,139
wreck and they haven't made any

735
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:45,120
provision for the medical and we will

736
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:46,980
continue to battle away in order to get

737
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:51,379
this sorted out one way or another

738
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:51,380
thank goodness for John never diligent

739
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:57,539
I've got one last question for Andrew

740
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:00,420
and then we're gonna open it up to

741
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:01,889
questions from the audience I think you

742
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,990
started to touch on this a little bit at

743
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:05,970
the end of your last answer but being a

744
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:07,829
retailer in this new market what are

745
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:10,410
some ways that retailers can add value

746
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:12,960
beyond the transaction especially with

747
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:14,970
such tight regulations yeah and they are

748
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,259
they are definitely tight and daunting

749
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:18,839
out the gay right now it's really hard

750
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:20,430
to get you know a message that connects

751
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:22,079
with consumers out there because you

752
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:24,750
really can't connect with consumers it

753
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:26,279
seems but you know again this idea of

754
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,569
creative compliance comes to light you

755
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:29,339
know we're not gonna play the passive

756
00:32:27,569 --> 00:32:32,039
role in this and just kind of you know

757
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:34,829
accept the fate here you know we're

758
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:36,210
gonna create opportunity and you know at

759
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:38,250
kierra we've been focused on really

760
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:39,750
building a strong relationship with our

761
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,190
supply partners that's where it starts

762
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:44,730
I've always been a firm believer that

763
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:46,559
our first row of customers is our

764
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:48,240
suppliers and so you know we built an

765
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,119
educational alignment program that's as

766
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,950
vested on four key pillars we look at

767
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:54,839
the customer education and customer

768
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:57,360
experience first you know you start

769
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:59,459
there if you empower people you know you

770
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,899
inspire them they become not just your

771
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,519
customers they come they become your

772
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,910
advocates and they can go out there and

773
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:04,650
do

774
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:06,900
work for you in terms of you know

775
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:09,120
galvanizing regulators and voting with

776
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,860
their wallets and hopefully voting you

777
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:13,559
know for changes in provincial and

778
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:14,699
federal regimes that are opposed to you

779
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:17,369
know what they're trying to pursue and

780
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,720
their vision and values and that

781
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:21,119
educational component in the store

782
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,920
extends to really again building that

783
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:26,369
relationship with the supply chain again

784
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:28,110
you know so many patients and in the

785
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:30,000
legacy market we're so connected to some

786
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:31,469
of the suppliers and those stories and

787
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,509
the people and purpose and passion that

788
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:35,610
help and help build those products and

789
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:37,769
and and created viable solutions that

790
00:33:35,609 --> 00:33:39,359
actually save people's lives so you know

791
00:33:37,769 --> 00:33:42,029
we're going back and really digging deep

792
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:43,949
on our supply chain and really creating

793
00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:45,660
that intimacy of exchange and learning

794
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:47,160
about the people and the processes and

795
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,870
the passion behind each of the products

796
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,310
are on the Shelf you know we don't try

797
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:51,809
and be a convenience store either I'm

798
00:33:50,309 --> 00:33:53,730
not there to just you know puke products

799
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:56,220
on people because that's the aim to sell

800
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:58,289
as much as we can we really have a

801
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,519
curated assortment that really speaks to

802
00:33:58,289 --> 00:34:01,829
the needs state of a well defined

803
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,660
customer demographic and then we really

804
00:34:01,829 --> 00:34:05,359
look to build that narrative with the

805
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:08,190
customer in terms of explaining how

806
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:09,809
these products are manufactured and

807
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:11,760
process and the care and intent that

808
00:34:09,809 --> 00:34:13,320
goes into that and we talk about where

809
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,909
it comes from you know I have the great

810
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,909
privilege of going on tours of some of

811
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:19,919
these million-dollar facilities and it's

812
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:21,510
tremendously encouraging to see the

813
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,158
energy and the vibe in them and we I

814
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:25,290
want to translate that into the retail

815
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:26,970
experience again talking about the good

816
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:28,949
work these companies do I had a chance

817
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:31,349
to go out and visit our friends at seven

818
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:33,210
acres in Keene Garden Ontario they have

819
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:34,980
an amazing vibe but their community they

820
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:36,418
really cultivate you know excellent

821
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:39,030
craft cannabis and they have a vision

822
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:40,529
and a purpose that again translates well

823
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,810
in the retail environment they have

824
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:44,879
great products as well great turf

825
00:34:42,809 --> 00:34:46,648
profile nerf Enid's it's really good

826
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:48,449
stuff a lot of the time despite a lot of

827
00:34:46,648 --> 00:34:50,668
the challenges with packaging and all

828
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:53,279
the other stuff that we're all we're all

829
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:54,960
upset about you know the second pillar

830
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,240
of that which is equally important is

831
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,440
community investment and involvement so

832
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:00,449
we really look to get out in the

833
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,980
community be proactive again as I

834
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:04,429
mentioned I serve as a director of acres

835
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:06,690
I'm out there advocating lobbying

836
00:35:04,429 --> 00:35:08,369
working with regulators and

837
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,900
decision-makers at all levels we can't

838
00:35:08,369 --> 00:35:11,819
stay passive in this we have to keep

839
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,710
engaging you know as elections come and

840
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,390
people change there's a lot of curiosity

841
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:16,570
we're at that crescendo point the

842
00:35:15,389 --> 00:35:18,579
conversation still

843
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:21,460
you're in people want to learn about

844
00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:23,230
this you know the the stigma is abating

845
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,760
itself slowly in the eyes of a lot of

846
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:26,170
municipalities they want to learn about

847
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,330
cannabis they want to hear about the

848
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:30,610
value of the regulated environment and

849
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:32,920
how that can help improve public health

850
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:34,690
and safety and address the the concerns

851
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:37,180
around the illicit market by providing a

852
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:38,590
path for transition and really you know

853
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:40,269
protect the interests of young people I

854
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:42,160
mean that's those are messages and and

855
00:35:40,269 --> 00:35:44,980
and and metrics that we can actually

856
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:46,929
deliver as a regulated retailer and then

857
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:48,940
the third pillar that we really position

858
00:35:46,929 --> 00:35:50,739
ourselves around in terms of creating

859
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:53,710
value beyond the transaction is staff

860
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:55,929
education again your frontline staff

861
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:57,849
right now if you were retailer that is

862
00:35:55,929 --> 00:35:59,199
your lifeline you will live or die by

863
00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:01,449
the relationships they create at the

864
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,980
counter because the product quality not

865
00:36:01,449 --> 00:36:04,509
in all cases but most of them isn't

866
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:06,579
there yet people don't like the

867
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:09,160
packaging getting ID'd at the front

868
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:10,960
sucks you know you're 68 years old

869
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:13,539
coming in getting ID'd you forgot like

870
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,159
it's absolutely ridiculous sometimes but

871
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:16,809
you have to take the care you have to

872
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:18,639
take the consideration you got to build

873
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:21,039
that conversation you can't take it for

874
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:23,289
granted we're earning relationships all

875
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:25,599
over again so we're literally starting

876
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:27,909
from scratch and and you have to have

877
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,679
that that humble you know stay hungry

878
00:36:27,909 --> 00:36:31,569
attitude in this business because you

879
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:33,099
cannot rest on your laurels you can

880
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:34,990
really expect nothing you have to build

881
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:37,299
it all yourself and you have to do it

882
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:39,939
with the community around you so I stay

883
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:41,680
well integrated with all of my retailer

884
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:44,380
partners as well I go to all their grand

885
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:46,029
openings spend a ton in their shops if I

886
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,320
can that first day I went out to the

887
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:49,120
city grant the city cannabis grand

888
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,400
opening on can athon can be an eight

889
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,289
spend 200 bucks just watching that stuff

890
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,000
fly up and down that tube if you've seen

891
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:57,219
it it's absolutely awesome so I'm

892
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,110
talking about my peers I'm out there and

893
00:36:57,219 --> 00:37:01,029
engaged in a positive light we don't

894
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:02,890
have time to be covetous and competitive

895
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:04,660
right now we have to build confidence in

896
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:06,429
the market again and we did that pre

897
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:08,109
legalization by sticking together as a

898
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:10,480
community and we're gonna do that again

899
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:12,099
and we focused on training our staff to

900
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,900
be able to deliver those messages get

901
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:14,889
out and be active and informed about you

902
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,110
know what's going on in the environment

903
00:37:14,889 --> 00:37:18,730
and really the lifestyle integration

904
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,019
component is well for a lot of consumers

905
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:22,809
who are new to this you know how do i

906
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:24,519
transport this according to the legal

907
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:26,380
framework how do I store this at home

908
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:28,329
safely as a parent you know we have

909
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,340
those conversations with our customers

910
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,608
at kiaro and then finally and this is

911
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,588
probably

912
00:37:30,608 --> 00:37:35,108
the most important pillar of it all is

913
00:37:32,588 --> 00:37:37,179
data and information exchange so right

914
00:37:35,108 --> 00:37:39,338
now we're learning again this whole

915
00:37:37,179 --> 00:37:41,018
process over and over again you know

916
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:42,038
every now with the Phase two products

917
00:37:41,018 --> 00:37:44,139
coming in it's going to be a whole

918
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:46,299
galaxy of new questions and uncertainty

919
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:47,348
I'm excited for the challenge of course

920
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:48,940
because I know it's going to meet the

921
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:50,650
need of a lot more consumers and give us

922
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:53,139
an opportunity to buoy our businesses

923
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:54,369
again and get some more revenue but but

924
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:56,170
at the end of the day you know we're

925
00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:57,579
really vested in in continuing the

926
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:59,920
conversations and building understanding

927
00:37:57,579 --> 00:38:02,440
with our supply chain with our local

928
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,139
stakeholders with our MLAs with our MPs

929
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,210
you know with our other fellow operators

930
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:08,679
and and and again you know everyone in

931
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:10,838
the community that's contributed so far

932
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:13,268
I mean you have a place to come and have

933
00:38:10,838 --> 00:38:14,828
a quality exchange at chiaro and we're

934
00:38:13,268 --> 00:38:17,048
incredibly excited to keep stewarding

935
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:17,680
that in a positive purposeful way thanks

936
00:38:17,048 --> 00:38:19,268
very much

937
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:20,980
very well said all three of you I'd like

938
00:38:19,268 --> 00:38:22,899
to open it up to questions from the

939
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:24,338
audience I think we have about five min

940
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:27,119
about five minutes let's hear it one

941
00:38:24,338 --> 00:38:31,989
more time for the panel that was great

942
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:34,390
does anyone have a question anyone

943
00:38:31,989 --> 00:38:35,858
Bueller Bueller apparently they were so

944
00:38:34,389 --> 00:38:38,440
informative that you don't have any

945
00:38:35,858 --> 00:38:44,259
questions it's very comprehensive would

946
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:45,639
be the word here we go good morning

947
00:38:44,259 --> 00:38:48,130
thank you guys so much for your time

948
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:50,469
closer okay

949
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:52,539
so I'm from California and if I

950
00:38:50,469 --> 00:38:54,759
understood correctly you mentioned that

951
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:58,930
you guys are limited to ten milligram

952
00:38:54,759 --> 00:39:01,028
doses per product does that correct as

953
00:38:58,929 --> 00:39:03,248
far as medicinally the proposed

954
00:39:01,028 --> 00:39:05,798
regulations are that you won't be able

955
00:39:03,248 --> 00:39:09,969
to have more than ten milligrams of THC

956
00:39:05,798 --> 00:39:12,400
in an edible in a discrete unit so you

957
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:16,899
could have a attend

958
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:19,180
milligram unit or two fives for say next

959
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:23,619
or inedible but the extract you could

960
00:39:19,179 --> 00:39:25,659
have capsules in in a container again

961
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:29,099
but it can't exceed ten milligrams of

962
00:39:25,659 --> 00:39:33,940
THC whereas a topical it's up to a gram

963
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:37,420
with no package size on the topical so I

964
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:41,030
would say recreationally that's what the

965
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:47,630
proposed limits going to be medicinal

966
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:49,849
we don't have a limit on on our doses we

967
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:52,070
can go to the doctor and arrange with

968
00:39:49,849 --> 00:39:54,950
them the Ahmet the daily amount that we

969
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:57,170
need and that we can get a

970
00:39:54,949 --> 00:40:00,189
recommendation for that and have a

971
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:03,050
medical license that allows us to use

972
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:06,980
more than what a recreational person

973
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:11,240
would be but because there are no

974
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:15,559
mechanisms for medicinal patients to get

975
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:16,729
their medicine other than this what

976
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:18,500
they're proposing in the new

977
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:20,719
recreational stores they're saying

978
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:23,510
medical people just go line up at a

979
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:25,789
recreational store and all your needs

980
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:30,980
will be not that and that is not the

981
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:34,190
truth so if we make our own cookies at

982
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:37,250
home we can do what we want to with as

983
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:39,800
far as the dose level goes but if we

984
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:44,210
need to have somebody else make a cookie

985
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:46,160
for us a lot of my customers that come

986
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:48,679
through our people that don't have a

987
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:53,059
fridge and stove or a mixing bowl to

988
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:55,730
make a brownian and they rely on us to

989
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:58,789
have the clean kitchen and the

990
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:01,280
standardized dose ready for them at a

991
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:05,119
reasonable price for them to be able to

992
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,500
consume on a daily basis and they

993
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,910
sometimes they don't they don't even

994
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,070
have a cupboard that they can keep a

995
00:41:07,909 --> 00:41:11,929
dozen cookies in for so they have to be

996
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:14,780
able to come and make a daily purchase

997
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:17,899
and they can't afford to buy this many

998
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:20,450
cookies if that was what they were

999
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:22,369
relegated to right and so I'm very

1000
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:24,529
passionate about the medicinal side of

1001
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:27,349
cannabis and so I'm curious as retail

1002
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:30,170
operations how are you guys getting

1003
00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:32,769
innovative and providing solutions or do

1004
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:35,119
you just have no solutions to offer

1005
00:41:32,769 --> 00:41:38,690
medicinal patients that come into your

1006
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,608
stores yeah I think you know the power

1007
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:41,990
of anecdote when you are so limited in

1008
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:45,230
terms of speaking to the efficacy of

1009
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:46,848
cannabis E or cannabis is important you

1010
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:48,059
know sharing that personal testimony as

1011
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:50,640
much as you can

1012
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:52,229
in a credible and genuine way and again

1013
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:53,969
you know we're really focused on you

1014
00:41:52,228 --> 00:41:56,759
know encouraging that as much as

1015
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:59,458
possible within the framework and you

1016
00:41:56,759 --> 00:42:01,170
know again the research is out there and

1017
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:03,268
you can point people to that even in a

1018
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:05,969
regulated retail environment you know

1019
00:42:03,268 --> 00:42:07,379
again the greatest victim of prohibition

1020
00:42:05,969 --> 00:42:08,880
was the research and now that's coming

1021
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:12,209
to light all around the world

1022
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,469
you know it's undeniable the proof and

1023
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:15,239
you can point people in that direction

1024
00:42:13,469 --> 00:42:17,219
and you can empower them to look at

1025
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:18,900
those resources make up their own mind

1026
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:20,759
make an informed decision and come back

1027
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,229
and and choose a solution offering

1028
00:42:20,759 --> 00:42:23,309
that's best aligned with that with

1029
00:42:22,228 --> 00:42:26,188
what's available in the retail

1030
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:28,079
environment and then we can you know

1031
00:42:26,188 --> 00:42:30,358
through events and an engagement outside

1032
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,309
of the you know designated for wall

1033
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:34,170
retail environment you know work and

1034
00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:35,759
partner with people who are educators on

1035
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:38,909
a whole host of different fronts whether

1036
00:42:35,759 --> 00:42:41,159
its medical therapeutic recreational you

1037
00:42:38,909 --> 00:42:42,688
know we can participate and and sponsor

1038
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:44,248
and be a part of events like that to

1039
00:42:42,688 --> 00:42:47,068
help to help push that conversation

1040
00:42:44,248 --> 00:42:49,018
forward to keep that portion of the

1041
00:42:47,068 --> 00:42:50,099
community and there's a large number of

1042
00:42:49,018 --> 00:42:52,228
them and you know even us as

1043
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:54,509
recreational consumers over the course

1044
00:42:52,228 --> 00:42:56,009
of our lives will be impacted by injury

1045
00:42:54,509 --> 00:42:58,139
illness and stress we'll have to use

1046
00:42:56,009 --> 00:43:00,478
cannabis in different ways as we're

1047
00:42:58,139 --> 00:43:02,759
encumbered by that so again the the

1048
00:43:00,478 --> 00:43:04,108
power of testimony and anecdote you know

1049
00:43:02,759 --> 00:43:05,728
really pointing people towards the

1050
00:43:04,108 --> 00:43:07,170
research and then you know helping to

1051
00:43:05,728 --> 00:43:08,879
support educators that are out there

1052
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:10,829
talking about cannabis and more than

1053
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,380
just a recreational sense that's what we

1054
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:18,869
do to help them empower consumers when

1055
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:21,239
we're so limited right now hi my name is

1056
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:24,989
Shari Bennett I own a company called

1057
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:28,349
let's talk cannabis I work on the front

1058
00:43:24,989 --> 00:43:35,849
lines with people in with pain severe

1059
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:38,130
arthritis seizures cancer many of my

1060
00:43:35,849 --> 00:43:40,289
clients are seniors who are getting

1061
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:43,048
their cannabis from their grandchildren

1062
00:43:40,289 --> 00:43:45,929
and they would like to get it legally

1063
00:43:43,048 --> 00:43:49,998
and they're having a constellation of

1064
00:43:45,929 --> 00:43:52,318
obstacles I whether one takes cannabis

1065
00:43:49,998 --> 00:43:55,738
recreationally or for medicinal reasons

1066
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:58,199
it's it's our bodies don't know the

1067
00:43:55,739 --> 00:44:00,460
difference it's medicine cannabis is

1068
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:03,490
medicine

1069
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:06,639
and I want to know that I want to

1070
00:44:03,489 --> 00:44:09,009
understand how what would it take to

1071
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:13,029
change the law aren't the courts gonna

1072
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:16,270
be just clogged there must be already

1073
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:18,490
right now because many of us when we

1074
00:44:16,269 --> 00:44:23,320
when we understand that every human

1075
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:27,369
being has an endocannabinoid system and

1076
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:29,860
that many diseases are a result of a

1077
00:44:27,369 --> 00:44:32,409
deficiency of the endocannabinoid system

1078
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:35,740
this is a topic that affects every human

1079
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:37,929
being right sorry question is like what

1080
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:40,119
do we have to do to change the law to

1081
00:44:37,929 --> 00:44:42,250
change the regulations what do we have

1082
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:47,109
to do how many more years will it take

1083
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:50,679
you know well I wouldn't say the courts

1084
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:52,840
are clogged certainly we have I used to

1085
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:55,119
get people calling me every day with

1086
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:58,090
being busted for cannabis I was called

1087
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:59,859
to the bar in 1972 and it went from a

1088
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:02,140
few hundred people being busted a year

1089
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:04,570
to ten thousand mostly for simple

1090
00:45:02,139 --> 00:45:07,480
possessions we don't have that anymore

1091
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:09,190
we don't the there's very few people

1092
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,110
who've been charged under the cannabis

1093
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:13,030
Act so but what you're talking about is

1094
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:16,120
these constitutional challenges and they

1095
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:17,740
do take a long time we have the national

1096
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:20,440
academy of science engineering and

1097
00:45:17,739 --> 00:45:23,139
medicine surveying all of the studies to

1098
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,970
do with cannabis throughout the world a

1099
00:45:23,139 --> 00:45:26,980
couple of years ago and concluded that

1100
00:45:24,969 --> 00:45:28,779
notwithstanding the difficulties in

1101
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:31,840
doing the research there is conclusive

1102
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:34,810
evidence that cannabis is effective for

1103
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:37,180
chronic pain what are the people dying

1104
00:45:34,809 --> 00:45:40,090
on the streets from today being

1105
00:45:37,179 --> 00:45:42,789
prescribed oxycontin and other types of

1106
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:44,559
opiates becoming addicted and then

1107
00:45:42,789 --> 00:45:46,509
getting going to the street when their

1108
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:47,199
doctors cut them off and getting a dose

1109
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:50,740
of fentanyl

1110
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:53,230
we know that cannabis we now have double

1111
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:55,899
blind placebo based gold standard

1112
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:58,510
studies that show that cannabis is one

1113
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:02,289
of the best exit strategy drugs to get

1114
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:05,470
people off opiates so again it's

1115
00:46:02,289 --> 00:46:07,119
unfortunate you would think with the

1116
00:46:05,469 --> 00:46:09,069
evidence that's available that the

1117
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:11,679
government's would be running to do

1118
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:12,309
something we may have to go to court in

1119
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:16,239
order to come

1120
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:17,619
them again yeah thank you so very much

1121
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:20,299
we're out of time I'm sorry let's hear

1122
00:46:17,619 --> 00:46:22,659
once again for the panel that was great

1123
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,659
[Applause]
